(unlike you know which game) the combat is decent, but the controls are a bit clumsy and can take a while to get used to. i mainly played as a mage and a bit with a rogue. rogue was surprisingly fun, having a parry mechanic is neat af! and i loved that the game doesn't hold your hand for most puzzles, the characters don't mumble the solutions to you if you're stuck for longer than 10 seconds, and a lot of the puzzles were very fun to solve! on the downsides, the open world bloat is a bit excessive. especially the shards, massive amount of effort for a practically nonexistent payoff. i love my open world side content, but it needs to have more variety and a more balanced effort/reward ratio. the ending left me excited for what's to come, and hopefully one day we'll get a true and faithful sequel to this very cool game!",TRUE,2,0,1762188990,8,Steam,5.34,"Adventure, Action"

Anger Foot,2198510,,,,CthlhuCory,this game reminds me a lot of the ghostrunner series where it's definitely a first person shooter/melee game but it's less about just shooting your way through levels and more about being precise. feels more like a puzzle game to an extent than just a straightforward shooter. definitely a game where it's all about trial and error and you will absolutely have to play a level multiple times to get your run down perfect. a little frustrating because of this and because it feels like a grind and i constantly feel like even if i am doing well i could get killed going through a new doorway and have to restart the whole level all over again. the music is great and it is kind of a ridiculous concept of the world run by gangs and you being the one guy who's not in a gang. gameplay is super solid though which is bringing me back into it for sure. the random driving mechanics they threw in to the last two levels of the game totally threw me off and they were not intuitively controlled at all and that dropped the score for me because a solid shooter became a janky drive fest in the very last stretch of the game.,TRUE,,,5-Feb-25,7,Metacritic,6.34,"Shooter, Indie, Action"

SUPERHOT,322500,,,,Frozya,"superhot — это необычный шутер, который выделяется своим уникальным игровым процессом. идея того, что время движется только тогда, когда двигаешься ты, заставляет продумывать каждый шаг и делает игру похожей на своеобразную стратегию в реальном времени. атмосфера минимализма и яркий визуальный стиль тоже играют свою роль: красные враги на фоне белого окружения смотрятся стильно и придают всему происходящему особый шарм.но, несмотря на оригинальность, есть моменты, которые могут надоесть. кампания довольно короткая, а после прохождения основного сюжета остается не так много причин возвращаться. кроме того, сама концепция замедления времени интересна, но в какой-то момент она перестает быть чем-то необычным и превращается в рутину.в итоге superhot — это отличная игра для пары вечеров, но ее идеи не раскрываются в полной мере. если вам интересен необычный взгляд на жанр шутеров, то она стоит внимания, но не ждите слишком глубокого опыта. 7 из 10.",TRUE,,,9-Nov-24,7,Metacritic,5.27,"Shooter, Indie, Action"

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,,,,Highwayy,"legends of runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. most importantly, lor innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like hearthstone). with most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. the artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like league of legends and arcane. the game offers an incredible and near-endless pve experience in addition to pvp: in fact, pvp has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. the future is difficult to predict and i hope that pvp will grow more as my heart will always be in pvp gameplay. perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for pvp. and that is something hearthstone cannot boast.",TRUE,,,16-Jun-25,10,Metacritic,5.41,"Card, Strategy"

The Wolf Among Us,261030,14.99,17,solo,HaloBlues,"god, i love this game. as tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something i dug, and it was done wonderfully here. the setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. the ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and i am both excited for and terrified of the sequel. hopefully it lives up to the first game's quality and ties up the loose ends it needs to. (sidenote i include with all telltale reviews: telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and i enjoy them when they do pop up in telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. they're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. they influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. the joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. i think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, i'd temper your expectations.)",TRUE,,,30-Mar-25,10,Metacritic,6.94,"Graphic Adventure, Adventure, Interactive Film, Action"

Prodeus,1200570,,,,kwstas2,"prodeus is an old school classic fps which takes inspiration from both the doom and quake series. it is a pretty good game and a satisfying shooter though is not perfect by a long shot in my opinion. what is best about it is the shooting and the sound design especially when it comes to gunfire sound effects. the level design through a decent amount of missions it provides is almost superb at its best to almost quite **** at its worst. the guns are pretty amazing overall and they are extremely fun to use with some being even better than others. visually is alright even with the retro thingy that is going for but still i wouldn't exactly say it's anything spectacular. what keeps it down for the most part in my eyes it's a lack of viriety in general whether it's the enemies, the environments, the textures etc. there is not much of any of that really. what annoyed me personally is the respawn system after death which is something similar to bioshock, i could explain why but i will just say that it just doesn't work for me. and the final thing which is not exactly a problem but maybe is worth mentioning is that the game is pretty short, it can get 10 hours give or take to do most things in the game.",TRUE,,,11-Apr-24,7,Metacritic,9.15,"Indie, Adventure, Action"
Prodeus,1200570,,,,Nmaa18,"short review: i have three main issues. i noticed after 10 hours of playing that i had never died from an enemy, the difficulty is in finding the ores and the exploration/platforming more than the enemies themselves unlike in doom where both are difficult. secondly, i find that finding these ores is incredibly difficult, to the point where i often need to look online for their locations. even getting the map doesn't help much, as it lacks clarity and is convoluted. the issue is that the store is an integral part of the game, and not getting ores holds you back gameplay-wise. finally its a little bit repetitive, but i guess this is an inherent/vestigial trait of this sort of old school fps-style game. nevertheless, the game is still fun, and the sound design, style, and sfx are great and helps set prodeus apart from the rest. shooting feels great too. finally i like the amount of content there is, and the community maps is a great feature that adds a creative aspect and more replay-ability. it's a simple, fun game to briefly play daily. 76/100.",TRUE,,,5-Mar-24,7,Metacritic,9.15,"Indie, Adventure, Action"

Sea of Stars,1449850,,,,Hackattaque,"like chained echoes, sea of stars is a beautifully crafted throwback to the 90s rpg era, complete with all the quality of life improvements that we’d expect in the 2020s. no more random battles, painful level grinding and scattered save points; and as for the old-school ways of turn-based combat, it’s been given some clever twists, including a puzzle-lock system that gives you a chance to stop your opponent’s attack with the right spells. where chained echoes goes for a very elaborate and epic story full of plot twists, though, sea of stars goes for a more intimate and cozy tale of friendship and loyalty between three childhood friends who have a clear enemy to defeat. and whereas chained echoes had some fairly sprawling level environments, sea of stars has a more compact approach to dungeons, with tight puzzles to solve and pretty varied themes. i would say overall i preferred sea of stars for its moment-to-moment gameplay and chained echoes for its story. both have pacing issues and neither quite manages to reach classic status; still, i enjoyed both a lot and hope their developers will put out even better follow-ups.",TRUE,,,8-Mar-25,8,Metacritic,6.09,RPG

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,,,,CnPx98,this game is really underrated. i thought the story was amazing and because of the interactions i focused even more then i would whilst watching tv which made it even better. i really loved all the characters and found them all interesting. the game can be slow at times but even during them moments i never lost interest because the story still was moving forward at a good pace. a couple of things that i didn't like was that the game was way to easy. i know it focusing on story telling but still would have been nice if on the odd occasion something challenged you like qtes (quick time events) or some harder puzzles. a couple missions were kind of detective sort of thing but they were mostly self explanatory. another thing that was frustrating but not really an issue with the actual gameplay. for some reason when i 1st installed the game it kept crashing after completing chapter 1 and loading chapter 2. i tried verifying files (xbox app) and that didn't fix the issue. when i reinstalled it was fine thou. mite have been a corrupt file or something. it was saying something about a ue4 siren but no error code. another thing to note was that throughout the hole game i was getting random screen tearing during cutscenes. i tried messing about with video settings but nothing solved the problem. apparently it is just an issue with the game. its annoying thou cos the game has been out half a year and this should be fixed. overall the game is amazing and i really enjoyed it. if you enjoy slow pace story games then you should give it a go!,TRUE,,,10-May-22,8,Metacritic,5.34,"Adventure, Action"

""no two balatro match is truly the same"", ""the game's deep mechanics deserves so much love"", as if those two things aren't always the standard of a rogue-like game???maybe my bias is; i'm a very seasoned rogue-like player. hades, inscryption, slay the spire, risk of rain 2, dead cells etc. all of these games shaped up my expectation of a rogue-like entry. while i'm not taking away the fun that people are having with balatro (i'm absolutely having fun with the game too!), i feel like these things that people give balatro so much credit for, aren't anything but the genre's standard for me.this game is amazing, i won't deny that. it's a great value for anyone into the rogue-like genre, but i feel like the praises this game gets are a little overblown. compared to slay the spire, and inscryption, this game stands tall as a deck builer rogue-like with a fun & charming poker game aesthetic. presentation-wise, balatro isn't the most interesting thing out there, not even in my gaming library. however, an amazing game is an amazing game. i won't try to deny that. 9/10.",TRUE,,,31-Aug-25,9,Metacritic,6.53,"Casual, Strategy, Indie"

Cult of the Lamb,1205140,,,,MimicTheShadows,"this game is severely underrated and very overlooked compared to many other top notch indie games. taking care of your cult is, while not all that complex, fun and provides some good downtime while preparing for your next crusade. the combat is serviceable and does what it has too but it can get repetitive pretty fast. this was a lot worse in earlier versions of the game but has gotten better with the introduction of relics and heavy attacks. i’m sure the upcoming dlc will work to fix this major issue and if it does i’ll update this review, now if that was all i’d probably rate this game a 6 or a 7 but the big thing that really pulled me in was the lore. the story itself is fine. most will not get much out of it other than a reason to kill the bosses and a means to an end, but a lot of the world building in this game is actually fantastic and has kept me intrigued for the last two years. now i want to avoid spoilers in this review so i won’t go into detail but i’m very excited for how the lore will get expanded upon in woolhaven. also the art and music are perfect for this game. i have no notes (other than the birds). overall, 7.5/10 experience that is worth a playthrough or two!",TRUE,,,26-Aug-25,8,Metacritic,7.85,"Indie, Strategy, Adventure, Action"
