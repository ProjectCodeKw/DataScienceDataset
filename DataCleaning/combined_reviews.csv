Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,76561198406290564,"For me, this game is ""A beautiful overrated and incredibly annoying test of patience"".

The intro were so effing long I had to go into the game folder and delete those darn three videos and you should do the same if you don't want to spent an hour long watching that shjt when you first start the game.

Slow pace, so much walking. There are literally 10 more badass soldier on the train and I have to do all the work for them, alone, make no sense. And my chick and her sugar daddy keep yelling at each other all the time.

NPCs talk a lot and continuously, and argue endlessly, one person hasn't finished speaking yet and the other has already jumped in and yelling. The English dub is really bad, cringe and tense with a weird accent, I had to switch to Russian dub to listen to it less annoying.

Annoying buzzing sound (on my watch I guess) really drive me crazy!! WTF what that? Idk if it is a bug/glitch or game's feature but I can not stand it any second. F that sheat!

One thing that seemed really cool at first but turned out to be really ridiculous was the sound effects, for example when an NPC was talking, I was standing right in front of them but when I turned the camera left/right/behind I couldn't hear them anymore, it was funny and ridiculous.

Well, based on the ""very positive"" reviews on steam, the game doesn't seem bad at all, maybe it just isn't for me, after 5 hours I'm lost it and I'm like ""fvck that shjt I'm out"".",True,0,0,1764171896

Lethal Company throws players into a darkly comedic sci-fi world where you and your crew of unfortunate contractors are sent to abandoned industrial moons to salvage scrap for a ruthless megacorporation. What starts as a simple job quickly spirals into a tense, unpredictable experience as every mission risks becoming your last.

The game shines in its cooperative gameplay and emergent chaos. Working together to explore derelict facilities, avoid traps, and carry loot back to the ship creates constant tension—especially when creatures begin stalking the halls. Communication, quick thinking, and teamwork determine whether you escape alive or become yet another “unfortunate loss” on the company ledger.

The progression loop is simple but addictive. Collect scrap, sell it, buy better gear, and take on more dangerous environments. Each moon offers unique layouts, hazards, and threats, making every run feel fresh. The randomness of enemy encounters and environmental quirks adds to the thrill and unpredictability.

Atmosphere is one of the game’s biggest strengths. The dim lighting, eerie soundscapes, and unsettling creature designs create an environment that’s equal parts scary and hilarious—especially when panic sets in and everything falls apart. The blend of horror and humor gives the game a unique charm that keeps players coming back.

Final Verdict:
Lethal Company delivers a perfect mix of tension, teamwork, and unpredictable fun. Whether you're playing seriously or embracing the chaos, it’s an endlessly entertaining co-op experience filled with memorable moments and dark humor.

“Terrifying, chaotic, and ridiculously fun—clock in, survive, and hope the Company approves.”

Helldivers 2 can be fun playing with randos as the community is fun. People also seem to like getting in character (not a huge surprise given how funny/lovable the world is). Monetization feels very fair as well if you have no intention of buying any premium credits. But the game really comes into its own with friends. It also comes in at a lower price point to make getting your friends onboard easier. This game is zanny chaos incarnate.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198986901858,"Resident Evil 7: Biohazard marks a bold and terrifying return to the series’ survival horror roots. By shifting to a first-person perspective, the game plunges players directly into the claustrophobic and unsettling world of the Baker family, delivering an intensity and immersion rarely seen in horror games.

The atmosphere is pitch-perfect: every creaking floorboard, shadowy hallway, and grotesque detail contributes to a constant sense of dread. The game’s visuals and sound design are exceptional, combining to make even familiar settings feel deeply menacing.

Gameplay emphasizes survival and careful strategy. Ammo and resources are scarce, forcing players to think before they act and heightening the tension of every encounter. Puzzles and exploration are intelligently designed, rewarding curiosity while maintaining a constant sense of vulnerability.

The story is gripping and horrifying, blending psychological terror with body horror in a way that feels fresh yet unmistakably Resident Evil. The Baker family, particularly Jack Baker, are unforgettable antagonists whose presence keeps players on edge throughout.

Overall, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard revitalizes the franchise with a terrifying, immersive experience that balances horror, story, and gameplay flawlessly. It’s a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers seeking a true survival horror thrill.

Nothing prepares you for the Bakers. No horror movie, no nightmare, no childhood fear. They don’t just attack you — they claim you. Jack speaks to you like you’re already family. Marguerite feeds you like she wants you to rot properly. Lucas watches you break and laughs because he knows he’s already won.

Every time I healed, the pain returned differently.
Every time I lost part of myself, something else grew in its place.
The house learned me.
Room by room. Breath by breath.

And the worst part? A part of me understood it. The mold doesn’t lie. It shows you exactly what you’re made of — usually blood, panic, and very bad decisions.

The DLCs feel like the memories I tried hardest to bury. Fragments, regrets, things I didn’t want to relive but kept resurfacing like the swamp water in my lungs. Some offered closure. Some reopened wounds that never had time to close.

I survived.
But survival feels like a technicality.

If you play this — and I’m not saying you should — just remember:

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198844332093,"RE 7 was an incredible journey from start to finish. What struck me the most was the psychological depth of the story. The game doesn’t rely only on jumpscares or gore; instead, it builds an unsettling narrative that slowly gets under your skin. I was fully immersed from the very beginning, and the tension never really let go. Every twist hit at the perfect moment and kept me completely hooked.

The world-building is another major highlight. The environments, small details, and characters all work together to create a story that feels carefully constructed and genuinely thought-provoking. You can feel that every room, note, and encounter has a purpose, and that makes exploring incredibly rewarding.

The DLCs also deserve a mention, they're a must-play. They add great post-game content that feels meaningful rather than just extra filler, and they gave me even more appreciation for the whole game.

If I had to point out one weaker part, it would be the section on the ship. It slows down the pacing and drops a bit of the tension that the game builds so well elsewhere. It’s not bad, just noticeably less gripping compared to the rest.

Overall, Resident Evil 7 is another excellent entry in the saga. Finishing it at 100% was absolutely worth it, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who wants a tense, atmospheric, and memorable horror experience.",True,2,0,1764114248

The main gameplay is you creating this big community where your tribe is thriving and make a living out of what the environment gave you. The tutorial explain very clearly on what to do and I can easily follow it without having a question about what is what. Somehow my community is thriving even only with foods and woods lol they need so little.

I have several question tho, why is the BGM so  little? I almost can't hear it at all. Not just that, I also wonder why there is a new wall decor keep showing on the screen even if the player still doesn't know what it does? I do feel like there are too many unnecessary pop up happening at the start of the game making it confusing for me. And while on that point, I do feel like the way the community gathering resource is a little slow on normal difficulty? I had to plan my community member precisely to get the necessary resource at the start. I do feel like that shouldn't be necessary at the start of the game.

is strong and the world feels harsh in a way that fits the game's setting. Building up a settlement,
assigning workers, and trying to keep everything stable kept me engaged.
The Ul takes a bit of time to get used to. Some panels feel bulky, and the resource area can get
crowded once you start unlocking more production buildings. The conveyor system also feels a little
unclear at the moment - I wasn't always sure how much it was actually helping. Upgrading buildings
didn't feel like a big improvement early on, so it was hard to tell when an upgrade was worth it.
Even with those rough edges, I enjoyed the core gameplay loop. Expanding, managing resources, and
dealing with the survival challenges is fun, and there's clearly a strong foundation here. With
continued improvement, this could become a really solid survival city-builder.

The amount of technologies, buildings, and events is more than enough to keep you hooked for hours.

I do think the game could benefit from randomly generated maps, as that would add even more replay value. The tutorial is somewhere between small and medium in size and I actually got so absorbed in the gameplay that I completely forgot to research new technologies. Unfortunately I didn’t get many notifications about it and by the time I realized my mistake, it was already too late - I didn’t have enough resources. I started rushing my research, but I still couldn’t catch up, and eventually the separatists rose against me and I lost my village :D

Anger Foot,2198510,29.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",76561198367471798,"New Cycle is a survival-focused city-building strategy game that attempts to merge classic settlement management with the tension of rebuilding civilization after a catastrophic solar event. Developed by Core Engage and published by Daedalic Entertainment, the game imagines a future in which intense solar flares have brought the world to its knees, wiping out infrastructure and scattering humanity into isolated pockets. Your task is to lead one such remnant community from its most fragile early days toward a revitalized industrial society capable of enduring the harsh new reality. The premise is familiar enough for fans of survival builders, but New Cycle approaches it with a broad, systems-driven ambition that aims to capture the slow, methodical rise from improvised shelters to structured industry.

At its foundation, New Cycle offers an extensive management loop that revolves around resource gathering, worker roles, production chains, and technological progression. You begin by establishing basic shelters and securing essential supplies like water, food, and raw materials. As the settlement stabilizes, the complexity deepens: you introduce new professions, research scientific advances, erect specialized buildings, and manage increasingly intricate supply lines. The game presents multiple biomes with distinct challenges, from resource-poor deserts to storm-ridden forests, forcing you to adapt your strategies to the environment. Seasonal cycles and extreme weather events—sandstorms, floods, electrical anomalies—add urgency and unpredictability, pushing you to plan ahead while reacting to sudden setbacks. The rhythm of development feels natural for players who enjoy long-form planning, letting the settlement evolve organically as new eras unlock.

A notable strength of New Cycle is the sense of growth reflected in its visual and atmospheric presentation. Early structures are makeshift and rudimentary, yet as you progress into new eras, your settlement gradually transforms into a more industrialized and organized cityscape. Lighting, weather effects, and environmental detail contribute to the mood of post-collapse rebuilding, emphasizing how fragile your people are compared to the forces around them. Zooming out, you can appreciate the sprawling networks of roads, workshops, farms, and factories that begin to define your settlement’s identity. While the interface is still in need of refinement in some areas, it generally supports the management tasks with clear resource displays and functional menus. The overall tone is one of struggle intertwined with hope—a world where every advancement feels earned.

Despite these strengths, New Cycle’s early access state means that several aspects of the experience feel unfinished or unbalanced. Some mechanics, such as worker assignment and production optimization, lack the polish or transparency seen in more mature city-builders. Information feedback can occasionally be insufficient: resources may deplete unexpectedly, weather hazards sometimes arrive without enough warning, and certain buildings feel disproportionately essential or inefficient. The pacing can also be uneven, with stretches of slow development followed by abrupt surges in difficulty. Some narrative or decision-based elements, hinted at in the game’s description, are present but not yet deeply realized, making moral or strategic choices feel more cosmetic than impactful. These issues don’t break the experience, but they serve as reminders that the game is still evolving toward its broader vision.

Another area that may divide players is the tempo of gameplay. New Cycle leans heavily toward slow, incremental progress, echoing the grind and patience required to rebuild from scratch. For some, this creates an absorbing, meditative challenge, but others may find the pace too sluggish—especially when waiting for complex production chains to stabilize or for research projects to unlock. While the game includes systems for accelerating time, the inherent density of tasks and the need to react to disruptions can make the process feel drawn out. Those who thrive on micromanagement and careful long-term planning will likely appreciate the depth, but players seeking faster or more dynamic progression may feel the weight of the game’s deliberate pacing.

Even with its early access limitations, New Cycle presents itself as a thoughtful and promising entry in the survival city-building genre. It offers a compelling foundation built on resource scarcity, environmental volatility, and the satisfaction of constructing a self-sustaining society in a damaged world. Its visual atmosphere, layered systems, and sense of gradual progress create a strong framework for future updates and expansions. The game is clearly aimed at players who enjoy methodical, detail-oriented building experiences and who are willing to tolerate some rough edges while the developers refine balance and usability.

Ultimately, New Cycle is a game about endurance—both for the settlement you are guiding and for the player willing to shepherd it through an unforgiving landscape. It has the potential to develop into a standout title once its systems mature and its pacing becomes more consistent. For now, it remains a solid, intriguing, and sometimes rough-edged foundation for what could become a deeply satisfying post-apocalyptic city-building experience.

You have to watch out for enemy waves or prevent your Coloniest from Starve to death or fight against the wildlife and find a horrible end ^^ 

You can help each other in Coop by sharing resources or even Power so you can have some fun or laught while your friend shot his own Coloniests xD.



**GER:**

AColony ist eine ansprechende Mischung aus Rimworld und 3D-Elementen.

Zu Beginn muss man sich zuerst an die Steuerung gewöhnen, besonders die verschiedenen Ebenen können schnell verwirren oder dazu führen, dass Kolonisten verloren gehen, wenn sie auf einer 1x1-Plattform stehen.

Eines der besten Features des Spiels ist der Co-Op-Modus, der von Anfang an verfügbar ist. Er lässt sich sehr einfach bedienen, da er direkt über Steam genutzt wird. Es fallen keine Serverkosten an und man muss nicht lange suchen, um einen Server einzurichten. Einfach auf „Coop Host“ klicken und loslegen!",True,2,0,1752025675

This game is very punishing, and mostly fair. There's a LOT going on. The introduction is ok, but the best learning is from trying things out, failing, and doing better next time.

There is a creative mode option as well that is very helpful for trying things out with little to no consequences.

There's an excellent 'perk' system that allows for a wide variety of playstyles, from the simple melee bruiser, to the intellectual trap master, to the classic stealth archer, and many more.

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198877995722,"I decided to write this review since I see a lot of people have a rough time with the entry barrier into Master Duel. 

Master Duel is described by Konami as the place where you will duel at the highest level and when they say highest level they are not downplaying it. First things you need to be aware of is that yes there is a barrier when you start playing that at first might seem overwhelming, but you need to remember you are jumping at the deep-end of the Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling experience. Some people criticize Master Duel for not being beginner friendly, and although I do agree there is a curve to adapt to in terms of dueling, specially for people who are returning to Yu-Gi-Oh after many years away or people who have only watched the anime or who are experiencing the brand for the first time, I also think the game gives you the tools so that you are able to build a strong deck very early into the game. 

Chances are yes you are going to get whooped during your first couple of duels, but that is to be expected since you are at the first steps of your deck building but if you put your time to learn the ins and outs of the game, it is a great way to enjoy the franchise. 

Some useful things things for people willing to give it a shot:
- Master Duel is very very F2P friendly, the game gives you so many easy ways to get gems (the currency used for opening packs) and occasionally even give you full structure-decks through things like friend code referral and such. If you manage your gems correctly you can easily make a viable competitive deck in just a few minutes and can probably average a new deck every month or so.

- Do your tutorials (skip them if you have a basic understanding of the game) and after, when picking one of the 3 beginners decks, just pick the one that matches your latest understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! 

- Before entering ranked matches, go to solo mode and there you will find many ""missions"" that reward you with cosmetics such as mates, duel fields, sleeves and even some actual card, but most importantly finishing the Duel Strategy missions reward you with a total of 2,400 gems. By doing solo mode not only can you unlock different rewards but you will also fulfill some of the challenges and missions that reward you with even more gems. 

- Now when it comes to currencies we have gems which are used to open card packs and just buy anything from the store and you also have crafting points (CP) ranging from Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare points. These CP are used to craft cards individually which is helpful if the card you are looking for is not available on any dedicated pack or if you only need to craft 1 copy of that card. In principle crafting a card take 30 CP regardless of the rarity (and when crafting there is a random chance of it being one of three different types of foiling which basically just means how shiny the card will be). Then some cards you don't want can be dismantled into CP of the corresponding rarity of the card going from 10 - 30 CP depending on the foiling of the card dismantled. One thing to note with CP is that not all cards can be dismantled as some free cards you get wont be able to be dismantled, but every card from pack openings can be dismantled into CP (cards from structure decks can't be dismantled tho). Best tip is to spend your SR CP and UR CP wisely and only when you really want or need a card since they are the hardest points to gather at first.

- Now before building a deck, opening packs and crafting cards you need to ask yourself the most important question when joining Master Duel for the first time - Which deck do you want to play with? - This is the most important decision you will have to make since the deck you chose will be your partner for the first month or so, so more than a meta deck just go for the one you will have the most fun with.

- Once you know which deck you want to go with, the best thing to do is to just create a deck and add all the cards you will want in it, that way you will know which cards you have, which cards you are missing and their respective rarities. Then you have to best options, one of them is to take one SR or UR card from that archetype and craft it, in doing so you will unlock a secret pack from that archetype which then you can spend your gems opening packs to get cards from that archetype. You can also go into the store and look at the structure decks and see if the archetype you want is available there, that way by spending 500 gems you will get access to the core of the archetype and can be a shortcut to building your desired deck.

- 2 PRO TIPS when it comes to gems are NEVER SPEND GEMS on the MASTER PACK since the amount of cards in it makes it impossible to get anything you actually want (you are better sticking to secret packs) and also ALWAYS BUY THE DUEL PASS since this battle pass not only returns your gem investment if completed but also rewards you with limited-time accessories and tons of CP from all the rarities.

- If you really want to add a meta element to your deck you can also go to the shop special section and under bundle deals you will see bundles with 10 Master Packs and also a meta staple card. 

- With all of this said if you dismantle any and every card you dont need and if you claim your rewards and open more packs you will end up with a good deck to enter ranked as any cards you dont get can probably be crafted with the CP earned from the dismantle of cards. 

When it comes to dueling the game helps you flagging posible actions that can be taken or cards that can be played in case you are not fully experienced with your deck. As you climb through ranked you will earn more gems that can be used to make your deck stronger and such. 

Again, as this is a competitive TCG it does take time to settle in but the more time you put and as long as you are playing cards that are fun to you I really think this game has a lot to offer for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. Ranked might be a tough pill to swallow at first but by making mistakes and losing duels is how you will learn.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561199025497003,"Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a tactical role-playing game that revitalizes the classic CRPG formula with depth, freedom, and smart writing. It combines strategic turn-based combat, meaningful player choice, and cooperative gameplay to create one of the most complete role-playing experiences of its generation.

The story follows two Source Hunters investigating a mysterious murder in the city of Cyseal, gradually uncovering a plot that threatens the fabric of reality. The narrative is layered with humor, moral ambiguity, and philosophical undertones. Dialogue choices matter, influencing character relationships, quests, and even combat outcomes.

Gameplay is defined by its interactivity. Almost every object, surface, and environmental element can be manipulated. Fire spreads, water conducts electricity, and poison ignites. Combat becomes a puzzle where creative thinking often wins over brute force. This system rewards experimentation, not repetition.

Character creation and progression are flexible. Players can customize skills, attributes, and abilities without being locked into rigid classes. Cooperative play enhances this freedom—two players can explore, argue over choices, or separate to pursue different objectives simultaneously. The resulting dynamics make co-op feel organic rather than forced.

Visually, the Enhanced Edition improves textures, lighting, and interface clarity while keeping the game’s distinct hand-painted fantasy style. The redesigned UI and full voice acting make exploration and dialogue more immersive. Every conversation and environment feels alive and reactive.

The writing maintains a balance between wit and seriousness. Quests often carry multiple solutions, and morality is never simple. Whether you’re solving a murder, arguing with a talking shell, or deciding the fate of an entire village, the game constantly invites critical thinking and reflection.

In essence, Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a masterclass in player agency and tactical depth. It’s challenging, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Every decision feels personal, every victory earned through intellect and creativity. It stands as one of the finest examples of modern role-playing design rooted in classic principles.",True,1,0,1762683612

The graphics are pretty good for everything other than the people, and if that's a sticking point for you then I would still recommend going with the remaster either via upgrade or buying it outright.
There is a good range on difficulty from Very Easy, to Ultra Hard. I personally found it to be best on Hard/Very Hard as it makes you use more of your tools, but I also find the jump from Very Hard to Ultra Hard to be a bit much compared to the others.

The writing is... mediocre. Many points are rehashed several times on several different occasions and the dialogue swings wildly between stock NPC templates and amusing if not interesting characters, most of which I find to be located in the DLC. To its credit the few times the game gives you a choice in how to respond it feels like the choice is actually different from the others, but they do all lead to the same point in the end.

The combat has unique systems, and a good number of monsters to fight, even with a fifth of them being some flavor of ""large cat with a gun strapped to it back"". There probably could have been a bit more variety in monster types, but the ones that do exist each have their own strengths and weakness to exploit, so combat feels more engaging than just ""hit the thing till it dies"".

I don't like it, and I don't hate it. it's just kind of. There. I feel like this game is massively overhyped and then when I got around to playing it, it took me a good few attempts to actually get into the game. The story is mediocre and I had already guessed most of the major plot points from act one alone since it is really unsubtle. and every thing good about the gameplay is just done better in Monster Hunter, in which Melee combat is also viable in that game as well, I don't understand why this game got so much hype around it and why Sony decided to throw Aloy's face everywhere and into every collaboration possible.

So I mean, I can't NOT recommend it, but I also can't recommend it. If someone was to already own this game though and bring it up in conversation, I'd say 'Yeah, I remember that game, it was aight' but if someone earnestly came out and mentioned that they might buy it, I'd tell them not to bother and just go get Monster Hunter instead.

First and foremost, there are a lot of things that were improved on:
- more and varying enemies
- improved area details
- more content
- improved graphics
- incredibly beautiful music
- world feels much more alive 

HOWEVER, here are my nitpicks:
- WAY too many abilities (my controller buddies will understand that one)
- parasitic game design with the abilities 
- puzzles are less creative than from the predecessor
- story is alright, however it feels like a downgrade from the story of the predecessor and doesn't make a whole lot of sense at certain points

At times it feels like the game is an Ori game in name alone. I REALLY liked the first game for what it made different from most games. I don't really understand why Ori needed weapons in this game? Especially since they feel a bit off for a character like Ori. 
Sure, Sein existed in the predecessor. Which you could technically count as a weapon. And certainly the first game had a lot of different ways to engage with enemies (stomp, throwing them into thorns, throwing glowing balls at them, throwing their own projectiles back, etc.). Perhaps I'm just thrown off that Ori was given swords, a giant frying pan, bows, spears, etc. in this game. Might just be me tho.
The sheer amount of different trees that can be found throughout the game make the trees much less special to find over time.
I remember playing blind forest for the first time and getting very excited for every tree I found. In ""Will of the Wisps"" finding trees does get tiring after a while due to the sheer oversaturation of them (not to mention all the other stuff you can find, like shards). 

I kind of wish that Ku would've played a bigger role/would've been playable for longer. 

At times it feels like the devs tried making a different game, but had to use the Ori IP for it (That's just my tinfoil hat theory tho, lmao)

If you expect puzzles like in ""blind forest"", this is not really the game for you. Stick with the first game.
This game focusses much more on combat and for that it's well done. The bosses are challenging and enjoyable (My favorite is Mora). Less abilities or a different way to implement them all would've been preferred from my point of view.
If you want a lot of bosses, play the Hollow Knight series instead.",True,0,0,1764182551
Octopath Traveler,1057090,7.49,0,solo,Action,76561199248183464,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps — A Breathtaking Journey of Light and Emotion

Ori and the Will of the Wisps invites players into a beautifully crafted world filled with wonder, danger, and heartfelt storytelling. From the very first moments, the game showcases a vibrant, hand-painted art style and emotional depth that elevate its platforming adventure into something truly unforgettable.

The game excels in its fluid movement and refined gameplay. Ori’s expanded abilities make traversal smooth, responsive, and deeply satisfying. Whether you’re dashing through forests, gliding across windswept plains, or navigating intricate platforming challenges, every moment feels buttery smooth and expertly designed.

Combat has been significantly enhanced. A new suite of weapons and abilities adds depth and strategy, making encounters dynamic and rewarding. From fast-paced battles to clever ability combinations, the system offers a welcome layer of complexity without overwhelming players.

Exploration and progression are deeply rewarding. The interconnected world encourages curiosity, offering hidden secrets, side quests, and upgrades that enrich the journey. Each new area feels distinct, beautifully animated, and filled with environmental storytelling that draws you deeper into the world’s lore.

Visually and musically, the game is a masterpiece. The stunning art direction, expressive animations, and emotional soundtrack by Gareth Coker create an atmosphere that is both magical and affecting. Every moment—peaceful or intense—is elevated by the game’s impeccable presentation.

Final Verdict:
Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a breathtaking and emotionally resonant masterpiece. With its polished gameplay, gorgeous visuals, and powerful storytelling, it stands among the best platformers ever made. A must-play for fans of world-class 2D adventure.

“A stunning blend of beauty, emotion, and masterful design—an unforgettable experience from start to finish.”

This game continues the style of the first one, with smooth platforming and a clear layout. The level design, graphics and gameplay are nice, and each area has different hazards to watch out for. I played both games with a keyboard and mouse, and the controls work well enough for the movements the game asks for.

The early parts are simple, mainly teaching basic actions. As the game goes on, the paths get more complex and the obstacles become trickier.

The devs really nailed the visual polish—every scene element has smooth, detailed animations that make the world feel lively, and the extra layering gives the whole game a stronger sense of depth. There are also a lot of smart quality-of-life touches that other Metroidvania-style games should definitely learn from: the death penalty isn’t excessive, there’s no pointless grind or “trash time” and the speedrun challenges are super efficient to retry. Mess up? Boom—instant restart. And when you finish a run, it sends u right back to the starting point eliminating unnecessary waiting or backtracking. Plus, all hidden items can be collected before finishing the game, so you never get permanently locked out just becuz the story moved forward.
[b]Downsides:[/b] Map opens with an awkward lag and doesn’t remember ur zoom level. The pacing falls off right before the end—there’s one brutally hard area that completely breaks the flow. New soundtrack doesn’t have any standout tracks, mainstory is pretty forgettable, and the guidance toward new areas is really unclear.

Octopath Traveler,1057090,7.49,0,solo,Action,76561198355316398,"[i]Ori and the Will of the Wisps[/i] is a masterwork. The game takes everything that made its predecessor great and enhances it, while adding new mechanics that greatly improve gameplay and expand the Ori universe.

In continuation from its predecessor, the game's visuals, lighting, and audio are as stunning as ever, and character movement and combat are fast and fluid. Worldbuilding extends upon what already exists in the Ori universe, with unique locations such as the coastal and colorful Luma Pools, the dark and scary spider's nest of Mouldwood, the cold and beautiful snowcapped Baur's Peak, and the sandy and desolate Windswept Wastes, all of which center around a magnificent Spirit Willow.

Ori's skill kit is greatly enhanced with a variety of weapons to keep enemies at bay and other utilities to aid mobility and survival, allowing for greater variety in the character's build. The environment itself presents new mechanics as well, from bubbles that can be redirected with a gust of wind to sand that can be burrowed through. There are also new monsters and environmental hazards to encounter, extending upon the Ori universe's biodiversity and danger.

One standout feature the game provides that its predecessor does not is boss fighting, pushing the Ori universe's biodiversity and danger even further. Additionally, boss fights add more variety to completing quests when chase scenes used to define quest resolution. All boss fights serve importance to the story in both heartwarming and heartbreaking ways.

And the soundtrack? Gareth Coker takes his music to the next level and surpasses even his amazing soundtrack for the game's predecessor. His music breathes life into every corner of the Ori universe, from environmental tracks, to chase scenes, to boss fights, to every uplifting and heartbreaking moment. His composition and arrangement of percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, and vocals never cease to amaze and are quintessentially ""Ori"".

Overall – Blasphemous is a haunting blend of tough combat, stunning pixel art, and deeply atmospheric world-building. Playing as the Penitent One, you explore the bleak land of Cvstodia, an environment overflowing with twisted religious imagery and beautifully crafted, unsettling detail. The gameplay leans into deliberate, Souls-like combat. Every swing feels weighty, every enemy demands attention, and bosses are memorable, punishing, and incredibly satisfying to overcome. You’ll die often, but each attempt teaches you something, making progress feel genuinely earned. The story is delivered through cryptic dialogue and environmental clues rather than straightforward exposition, giving the game a mysterious, poetic tone. It’s the kind of world that invites you to piece it together rather than giving you answers outright. If you enjoy challenging Metroidvanias with rich atmosphere and art that sticks with you, Blasphemous is absolutely worth playing. Highly Recommended.

I am sucker for religious paintings or perhaps enjoy romantizing martyrdom, this game succeeds in bringing a captivating beauty through misery. 
Speaking of misery, the gameplay of course takes large inspiration for Metroid and Dark souls. The game does well in making the game feel tough during certain bosses, though after a point it does become easier (I say in better or for worse terms.) The gameplay admittedly didn't sway me, if I had never played a Mouls-like or a metroidvania, it would be completely fresh to me but only recycles these ideas and I am afraid to say doesn't bring much to table in terms of new ideas. The gameplay itself does feel almost like an IGN review of an indy game. BUT, the game's atmosphere, and story is where the game begins to shine and find it's identity. It's a fun (though maybe Blasphemous,) retelling of Christ. The Penitent One goes into world to free it from suffering. Though in this game it's done by violence and not by kindness. It's an interesting and grim retelling of my beliefs. It's hopeful enough to not feel like an edgy gorefest and bleak enough to feel impactful. There is some gripes I do have with the story, but since I haven't played the sequel, I think it is best if I bite my tounge for now. I would give it probably a 7.5/10.",True,0,0,1764079754

Yakuza Like a Dragon,1121910,0.0,0,solo,"Casual, Indie, Simulation",76561199184821242,"This is a *real*, officially licensed, completely free dating sim where your main objective is to:

* Attend culinary school
* Make life-changing choices
* And romantically pursue a bishonen anime version of Colonel Sanders, who has more abs than menu items.

Not a parody *of* KFC.
A parody dating sim **by** KFC.

---

### Pros

* 100% free, which is good, because you’ll need that money for actual chicken afterward.
* Genuinely gorgeous anime art. Everyone looks like they escaped from Ouran Host Club and fell into a deep fryer.
* You’re a culinary student at the “University of Cooking School: Academy for Learning,” which is the most legally safe fake school name ever written.
* Cast includes:

  * Hot Sanders
  * Your supportive bestie
  * Evil rivals Aeshleigh & Van Van the Man Man (yes that’s his name)
  * Professor Dog, who is an actual dog in a little chef’s hat
* There’s a secret ending, “secret recipes,” and dramatic “cooking battles” that feel like Iron Chef on a marketing budget.

---

### Cons

* Steam tags say things like “Souls-like,” “FPS,” and “World War I” because the community is unhinged. Please ignore them.
* Choices “have consequences,” but most of the time the real consequence is Colonel Sanders being slightly disappointed in you, which honestly hurts more than a game over.
* Actual dating content is pretty tame; it’s less “thirst sim” and more “branding exercise with sparkles.” Critics were… not impressed. Players, on the other hand, are just vibing.
* You *will* finish it and realize you just emotionally invested in a man whose primary character trait is “11 herbs and spices.”

---

### Peak Colonel Experience

* Trying to give a sincere answer in class and being out-performed by a literal cooking robot named Clank.
* Getting genuinely nervous about impressing Sanders with your mashed potatoes.
* Replaying scenes to optimize dialogue like: “If I pick the wrong line, will he *not* franchise with me?”
* Credits roll and you close the game… then immediately google if anyone has actually cosplayed this version of Sanders. (They have. Of course they have.)

I’ve 100%’d Drakengard 3, beaten the original NieR on Xbox 360 and of course 100%’d NieR Automata. Sadly I’ve never been able to finish Drakengard 1 or even play 2. I’ve seen walkthroughs at the very least so I know what happens in them I guess.

I say all of that just so you know I’m obsessed with NieR. It is my favorite video game ever and this one feels the best to play. I like the post apocalyptic setting and story the most. I also have a soft spot for anything involving robots and androids (being a huge Ghost in the Shell fan). You can customize the characters in a ton of different ways to play however you want and there's nearly endless replay value. The music in this game is breathtaking. They created an entirely new language just for the soundtrack.

I’ve played every single port of this game to 100% completion and have over 100 hours in all of them. The best version is the Xbox port which is called Game of the YoRHa edition or something. Runs smooth, amazing visuals, responsive and like zero glitches or oddities. PS4 and Switch are fine with Steam being the worst.

Dont Starve,219740,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",76561198027758678,"It's creepy, chaotic, and WAY more addictive than I expected.

Don’t Starve surprised me with how well it blends whimsical art with grounded survival mechanics. The atmosphere is incredible, the survival loop is addictive, and the game still holds up after all these years. Combat is the weakest part, but everything else pulled me in. For the price, it’s absolutely worth it.

The Good:
• Amazing Tim Burton-style art and quirky tone
• Strong survival loop with great early-game pacing
• Realistic mechanics that actually matter (fire spreading, sanity, sleep)
• Weather, darkness, and nightfall create genuine tension
• Lots to discover and experiment with
• Time flies, easy to get absorbed

The Not-So-Good:
• Combat feels basic and predictable
• Early sanity confusion until you understand the system
• Building in a 2.5D space can feel a little awkward
• Requires trial-and-error before things start to really click

Final Verdict: 7.5/10

One of the better survival games out there if you like creepy whimsy and grounded mechanics. Combat needs work, but the atmosphere and loop are excellent.

Cyberpunk 2077 delivers an unforgettable mix of rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and deep, emotional character arcs. You can choose from a variety of different builds. Night City feels alive in every corner, and the choices you make truly shape your experience. After all the updates, the game runs smoothly and feels more immersive than ever.
And Phantom Liberty takes the game to another level, with a gripping spy-thriller story and some of the best characters in the entire game. Dogtown feels intense and alive, adding fresh gameplay, new weapons, and some unforgettable missions. The expansion’s writing and atmosphere are phenomenal, making every choice feel meaningful and heavy. If Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, Phantom Liberty is the perfect finishing touch—a must-play for anyone diving into Night City.

I replay it every half a year, still hits hard, but that first playthrough is unforgettable. Genuinely changed something in my brain chemistry. 

NEVER play without sound. The indie soundtrack is GOD tier. I get chills every time I listen to any of the songs either from this or the prequel.

Good story and characters, but suffers greatly from quantity over quality and RPG mechanic streamlining. [/b] [/h1]

[h1]PROS: [/h1]
➕Dragon Age Keep - carry your choices from DA1/DA2
➕Open world
➕Story and characters


[h1]NEUTRALS: [/h1]
🔹War room - while a neat thought, real-time missions can be a turn-off
🔹Requires EA launcher, but I found this largely unintrusive

[h1]CONS: [/h1]
➖Speech volume is absurdly low
➖No stat-based speech options
➖30 FPS-locked cutscenes
➖Overly-simplified character building
➖Can feel very “Quantity over quality” at times
➖Crash to desktop count = 4

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The game world can be quite spectacular to behold. Inquisition takes the foundation of DA1 and DA2 and expands it immensely. The locations you visit are varied, from ancient Elven forests to sandy deserts to stormy coasts, the locations are different enough to where the biomes don’t get repetitive and even have some throwbacks to DA1. Furthermore, the exploration and interaction are good. Each area has tons of collectables and lore entries that teach the player about the area and where it fits into the history of Thedas. 
Perhaps the big negative thing to point out here is quantity over quality. I would have preferred if there were actually [i]less[/i] zones with a greater emphasis on each zone being deeper and more meaningfully designed. Because while they are beautiful to behold and can be fun to explore, fatigue is very real and remembering the nuances of each area can be more difficult than it should be. 

The narrative is okay. It’s a typical “Big bad trying to destroy the world” type thing, but I think the setting and characters elevate the narrative to greater heights. 
As for the DLCs, Jaws of Hakkon is forgettable, The Decent is better, and Trespasser is probably the best bit of story content in the game, shame the best parts only last ~20 minutes. 

[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The mechanics are decent, but I feel that largely it is a step back in depth from DA1 and more inline with the gradual streamlining of DA2. The prior games had a unique take on Dungeons & Dragons, while DA:I feels much more shallow. It’s kind of like going from something like Final Fantasy X to FF XV - yes, it's prettier and faster and cooler, but the RPG mechanics suffer. Gone are any sort of stat-based conversation options, the character progression is simplified, and even abilities can feel very boring and shallow. The game does open up a bit when you unlock your classes' specialization, as some of those kits are fun and work very well with the base classes, but I still can’t help but feel an overall theme of having less RPG mechanics in an RPG game, which is a big negative for me. 
New to DA entirely (I think) is the crafting. This can help to customize your character's gear, especially if you don’t know where the best drops are or if you are simply unlucky. 

The difficulty is generally fairly easy, especially as you level up and unlock better gear and more talents. I played on Normal, and it was a tad difficult in the beginning, but by the time I unlocked my Knight Enchanter specialization after about ~12 hours, I was blowing things up.
One thing I did enjoy is the addition of “Trials” which are optional difficulty increases. You can choose to add elective difficulty increases for some small increased awards like additional loot. Things like having enemies level with you (which is how it naturally was in DA1/DA2) or even an option to turn bears into mini-boss gods. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The graphics are very PS4-era, and while they do age pretty well for a ~11 year old game, certain things like animations can be very stiff and reflections on metal surfaces appear just awful. Still, I think this is a great looking game for its age. 
Probably the worst area graphically is the menu UI. It definitely feels like the focus is on the console versions because the UI is just awful to use with a mouse and keyboard. You have to constantly do things like move your mouse off and then back onto an item to get the tooltip to display. 

On the technical side, the game is not good. I experienced multiple crash to desktops and many bugs when my game simply wouldn’t load, and I had to alt+F4 to the last save. Even aside from technical issues, I ran into gameplay bugs where my characters would stop using abilities, or I couldn’t pick up items on the ground. I had to reload often to fix them. I even ran into bugs where essential characters seemed to have fallen through the ground and was missing all their dialog, essentially ruining the quest.

[h1] [b] Audio – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
I found the audio to be good. The music is largely forgettable, but there were a few iconic songs that are great. 
Voice acting is top-notch and awesome. 
I did encounter many cases where the audio simply stopped working. From combat to dialog, no sound. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]
I think there is some decent replay value here - you can choose male or female, different races, different classes, and different romances as well as a few quests that have some slightly different outcomes. The game is pretty linear, but the choices can definitely warrant multiple runs. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Dragon Age Inquisition (DAI) is the THIRD game in the Dragon Age series. I highly recommend you go and play the first and second, as they have aged fairly well and are great experiences. Now that you’re here and thinking of diving into DAI what can you expect and how does it compare to DA1/DA2? 

DA1 has a very dark setting full of intrigue. It’s full of solid RPG gameplay that is parallel to Dungeons & Dragons. DAI does not largely have that. DA2 seemed like a step-down from many of the things that made DA1 so great, but it’s still a good RPG. I feel like DAI is on par with DA2 in that it's decent, but streamlined so much that player choice suffers. 

What DAI offers is a massive open world within the Dragon Age universe, like you’ve never seen it before. I want to make it clear that massive does not mean good. DAI has a clear problem of quantity over quality. You can easily burn dozens of hours doing fetch quests and other random pointless crap that serves no narrative purpose other than to increase your “Points” that you can then spend on unlocking more zones to do more pointless things that give more points…DAI is a nice 40-hour RPG adventure wrapped up in an 80-hour game. 

It’s not all bad, though. I would say the best part is the story. That 40 hour story is pretty good for about 20 of those hours. Especially the DLC, Trespasser. If Mass Effect’s sendoff was anything to go by, BioWare is very good at doing epilogues for their games and where it ends immediately makes you want more. Also, I have to do a shoutout to the great characters. It’s a pretty great cast of characters with their own personalities. Sera is my elfy wife. 

Overall, yes, I would recommend DAI. I think it's an okay game. Fans of DA1 and DA2 probably shouldn’t miss it. 

[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]
[h1]Yes[/h1]
$40 is steep for an 11 year old game. $10 sale price though is very good for the amount of content you get, and if you can get it for the historical low of $4, VERY worth.

[i](This review contains no story spoilers btw!!)[/i]

[b]-Overview-[/b]
Developed by BioWare, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a massive fantasy RPG that blends real-time combat with tactical strategy. Players take command of the Inquisition, leading a diverse group of companions to restore order to a fractured world. With hundreds of quests, beautiful environments, and meaningful choices, it delivers an epic adventure, but it is also heavily built on the foundations of the previous two Dragon Age games, and newcomers may feel they’ve missed major pieces of context.

[b]-Story & Characters-[/b]
[i]A strong, engaging story, best experienced after playing the first two games.[/i]
 Inquisition’s narrative is well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and packed with political drama, divine conflict, and moral decisions. However, the game relies heavily on world events, character arcs, and choices established in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II. Returning characters make cameos, past decisions impact present events, and major story threads continue directly from earlier titles.

For players who haven’t experienced the prior games, much of this depth risks feeling distant or incomplete. The Dragon Keep system, which lets you import or manually reconstruct past choices, helps fill the gaps mechanically,  but not emotionally. Reading about choices you never made or characters you never met is a poor substitute for having lived those stories yourself. This is one of the few RPGs where your personal history with the series genuinely matters, and missing that history can lessen the impact of major scenes.

As a first-time Dragon Age player, it’s easy to feel like you’re walking into the third act of a trilogy without having seen the first two. The story is still very good, but you’ll constantly sense that you’ve missed meaningful context, relationships, and payoffs. If anything: I wish someone had told me to play the first two games first. I would have enjoyed this story far more if I’d brought my own choices and experiences into it instead of relying on presets.

Companions are well-written and offer solid banter and personal quests. Their level of involvement is similar to Fallout 4: they’re memorable and distinct, but their presence has less influence on the core story than companions in Mass Effect or Dragon Age: Veilguard.

[b]-Gameplay-[/b]
[i]A complex combat system that becomes satisfying once mastered.[/i]
 Combat can be overwhelming early on, especially for players new to managing AI tactics and switching between party members. Over time, though, it becomes one of the game’s strengths. The mix of real-time action and tactical pausing allows for careful planning or fast-paced brawling, depending on your build. However, people who aren’t new to this type of combat system will find themselves bored with the lack of builds you can make with your character. Still, I found it to be quite enjoyable, regardless.

Character progression is exceptionally well-paced: you begin fragile and unsure, but grow steadily stronger through skill trees, specialization classes, and improved gear. You cannot brute-force enemies above your level, they will flatten you, but the game fairly challenges you within your tier.

Exploration is vast, and each region feels alive with wildlife, secrets, side quests, and collectibles. The sheer amount of optional content is impressive, though some zones can feel bloated with minor objectives.

[b]-World Design & Visuals-[/b]
[i]One of the most visually striking RPGs of its era.[/i]
 The landscapes are vibrant, diverse, and grounded in strong artistic direction. From snowy fortresses to lush jungles and windswept deserts, each region is detailed and atmospheric. The world feels alive and lived-in, and the lighting and environment design remain a standout even today.

[b]-Music & Sound-[/b]
[i]A solid soundtrack that shines in key moments.[/i]
 While the score is not consistently memorable on its own, it elevates major scenes beautifully. Music swells during emotional peaks and blends seamlessly into exploration. Voice acting is strong across the board.

[b]-Length & Value-[/b]
[i]A colossal RPG with well over 90 hours of content.[/i]
 Even a focused run takes dozens of hours, and completionists can expect significantly more,  especially with story DLC. At its frequent sale price, it’s excellent value. However, this isn’t necessarily a good thing, as by the end of the game, you start to get bored exploring all these different zones and doing all these different fetch quests, and at some point, you just wish for the game to end.

[b]-Replayability-[/b]
[i]Worth replaying only if you want to see major branching outcomes.[/i]
 The game offers multiple endings and many impactful choices, but each playthrough is a major time investment. Most players will likely complete it once and revisit it after a long break.

[b]-Summary-[/b]
Dragon Age: Inquisition is a richly developed RPG with excellent world-building, strong narrative arcs, and satisfying character progression. Its size can be overwhelming, but its story and environments are worth the time, provided you play the first two Dragon Age games first.

For newcomers, the Dragon Keep system cannot replicate the emotional weight of decisions you never made or relationships you never formed. The game is filled with callbacks, cameos, and payoffs designed for long-time fans, and much of that will be lost without experiencing the earlier titles.

[b]Highly recommended, especially after completing Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, which will greatly enhance the story and make Inquisition feel like the true saga finale it was designed to be. 9/10 game, not surprised it’s won game of the year before.[/b]",True,0,0,1763751839

The Wolf Among Us,261030,14.99,17,solo,Adventure,76561198020908921,"How early we’re forced to grow up when the whole world is falling into the abyss.
This story is about the coming-of-age of Clementine, an 11-year-old girl who had the misfortune of growing up far too soon, just like everyone else in these harsh times. Even as a child, she directly influences the course of events.

In this world, there are no “good” or “bad” people. You simply do what feels honest to yourself in order to survive in a cruel and unforgiving environment. Every character here is neither a hero nor a villain, but a person making choices—each with its own price.

From chapter to chapter, you realize that the walkers are only a predictable threat. The real danger comes from the people beside you. You barely know them, yet you must survive together. Will they stab you in the back? You can never be certain. And that uncertainty makes every decision heavy.

This story reflects your inner struggle—your desire to choose “the right thing,” even though there is no objectively right choice. Only consequences. The plot moves forward, and you are an unwilling passenger in it, wanting only one thing: to survive.

And then the main question arises: what are you surviving for?
You might want to hide in a corner and do nothing, but the walkers won’t allow it. You may hope to survive alone while the world burns, but people are far more dangerous than the dead—you never know what they’ll do or whether they’ll stay on your side. Only time will tell.

Everyone wants choices to be simple and clear… but when the world collapses, they never are.
Then again—were they ever?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Как же рано приходится взрослеть, когда весь мир катится в бездну.
Эта история — о становлении и взрослении Клементины, 11-летней девочки, которой не повезло оказаться в тяжёлое время, когда взрослеть приходится всем без исключения. Даже будучи маленькой, она влияет на ход событий самым прямым образом.

В этом мире нет «хороших» и «плохих». Ты просто делаешь то, что считаешь честным по отношению к себе, чтобы выжить в жестоком и недружелюбном окружении. Здесь каждый персонаж — не герой и не злодей, а человек, который делает выбор, за который платит свою цену.

От одной главы к другой понимаешь: ходячие — это лишь предсказуемая опасность. Но настоящая угрозa — люди рядом. Ты почти не знаешь их, но вынужден выживать вместе с ними. Вонзят ли они нож в спину? Никто никогда не скажет заранее. И эта неопределённость делает каждый шаг тяжёлым.

История показывает твой внутренний выбор — тот, который ты бы хотел сделать «правильно», но правильных решений здесь не существует. Есть только последствия. Сюжет движется вперёд, а ты — невольный пассажир, который хочет лишь одного: выжить.

И тут возникает главный вопрос: ради чего стоит бороться дальше?
Можно было бы спрятаться в углу и ничего не делать, но ходячие не дадут. Можно мечтать выживать в одиночку, но мир полон людей, которые куда опаснее мертвецов — ведь ты никогда не знаешь, что они сделают, и останутся ли они на твоей стороне. Это покажет лишь время.

Всем хочется, чтобы выбор был простым и понятным… но когда мир летит к чертям, он никогда не будет лёгким. Да и был ли вообще когда-нибудь?",True,0,0,1763842567

[i]SOMA[/i] is a first person horror game with clever philosophical depth and profoundness. This is achieved with a few trivial yet somehow awfully meaningful choices along a gripping journey through a bleak underwater research facility. Splendidly voice-acted protagonist Simon ([b]Jared Zeus[/b]) and his acquaintance Catherine ([b]Nell Mooney[/b]) provide their own opinions but leave room for the player to think.

SOMA's weakness is the lack of gameplay mechanics: it is a walking simulator with slight puzzle and stealth elements. Replayability is almost nonexistent due to that. But for one playthrough, the game does provide an immensely immersive 10-hour experience. The physical interactivity of objects -- pushing and pulling doors, grabbing and throwing stuff -- makes the game world feel tangible.

Certain sections with a monster can become frustrating if you get stuck on repeating them. Fortunately, in a post-release update, [b]Frictional Games[/b] added a Safe Mode option that stops the monsters from hindering your progress. The mode does reduce tension considerably -- since no actual threats -- but doesn't affect the overall gloomy atmosphere that much.",True,1,0,1764071698

Oxenfree,282140,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198040451963,"Soma makes great use of the first person horror medium to provoke ethical and other philosophical questions in the player. There's enough quiet time to ponder these themes in between the monster encounters, most of which I found genuinely scary. The challenge of the game is basically to keep your nerve and figure out the monster's behaviour - short puzzles under emotional pressure. I think you'll be missing out if you use safe mode. 

There are also several more relaxed puzzles without any monster stalking you, which I found interesting and well-judged in terms of difficulty. I felt like I really could be the protagonist, trying this and that until something works. I also really appreciated that the game felt like a real environment, with lots of spaces and objects that aren't relevant to the player. I find this adds a lot to immersion. Furthermore, there are no stupid easter eggs or steam achievements for exploring every inch of the map. You can actually behave like you would if you were really in this world, instead of running around like a maniac looking for dopamine.
 
The story is excellent and very original. Not only that, I'd call it anti-formulaic.
[spoiler]Terry Akers isn't some final ""big bad"" boss, and the last human alive isn't Catherine Chun, instead it's an ordinary woman who's a stranger to the player and to the protagonist[/spoiler]. The major decisions in the game are also left as instrinsically rewarding - they are for asking yourself what you'd do in an extreme situation. Not for thinking how you can get some achievement or alternate ending. 
The creators clearly thought a lot about what a game could, and should be. Strongly recommended to anyone into sci-fi, horror or philosophy.",True,0,0,1764024408

Oxenfree II,1274570,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,Indie,76561199248183464,"DEVOUR — Chaotic Co-Op Horror With Heart-Pounding Tension

DEVOUR plunges players into a frantic co-op horror experience where teamwork, panic, and quick thinking are the only things standing between your group and a terrifying cult entity. Each map feels like a self-contained nightmare, requiring coordination and courage as the tension escalates with every ritual item you collect.

The game shines in its simple yet effective co-op design. Working together to find items, manage resources, and dodge the ever-growing aggression of the possessed leader turns every match into a chaotic thrill ride. Communication is key—splitting up can mean faster progress, but also guarantees hilariously horrifying moments as someone gets dragged into the dark.

Atmosphere and pacing are major strengths. Each location—from haunted farmhouses to burning asylums—offers distinct threats, secrets, and environmental storytelling. The sound design ramps up fear at all the right moments, building suspense as the demon’s behavior evolves and the stakes rise.

Progression and replayability keep players coming back. Difficulty settings, unlockable cosmetics, and new maps with unique mechanics ensure that each run stays fresh. The unpredictability of enemy behavior and the frantic scramble near the end of each round make DEVOUR consistently exciting with friends.

Final Verdict:
DEVOUR is a fast, frightening, and wildly entertaining co-op horror experience. Its escalating tension, distinct maps, and teamwork-focused gameplay make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer scares and chaos-filled sessions with friends.

“Terrifying, frantic, and endlessly fun—horror co-op at its most chaotic.”

Pretty good horror game honestly. It looks simple at first but once the demon girl starts running at you full speed, bro your heart just drops. Playing with friends is hilarious and scary at the same time. It does get a bit repetitive sometimes, but it still keeps you on edge.

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198018847232,"Farthest Frontier is a carefully designed city-building survival game that combines strategic decision-making with a persistent sense of vulnerability. Set on the outskirts of untamed wilderness, it places you in charge of a small group of settlers striving to build a successful community in a harsh and demanding environment.

A major highlight of the game is its remarkable attention to detail. Every resource—firewood, crops, iron, and even manpower—feeds into a tightly connected system that requires thoughtful management. The depth of the farming mechanics, including crop rotation, soil health, and disease prevention, makes agriculture feel both authentic and engaging. Seeing your settlement grow from a handful of simple huts into a lively town is genuinely satisfying.

Visually, the game stands out as well. Its art style blends rugged realism with inviting warmth, while the shifting seasons, handcrafted building designs, and immersive environmental sounds work together to create a compelling atmosphere.

However, Farthest Frontier does not shy away from difficulty. Unpredictable events such as illness, severe weather, or enemy raids can easily erase significant progress if you’re caught off guard. Some players may also find the early game slow-paced and the interface overwhelming once the town reaches a larger scale. Still, these hurdles contribute to the game’s identity—survival is meant to be challenging.

In the end, Farthest Frontier delivers a highly rewarding experience for those who enjoy deep city-building and survival strategy games. It values patience, foresight, and adaptability, offering a strong sense of achievement each time your settlement endures another brutal winter. For players who appreciate games where every choice has weight, this title is definitely worth playing.",True,0,0,1764142096

I went in expecting a simple little arena shooter to kill some time, and it quickly became one of my go-to ""just one more run"" games. The gameplay loop is fast, chaotic, and super satisfying—exactly the kind of fun that hooks you without feeling overwhelming.

What I love most is how easy it is to pick up. You can jump into a run within seconds, but there’s an impressive amount of depth once you start combining weapons, items, and character abilities. Every run feels different, and even the failures are fun because you immediately see what you want to try next.

The humor and style are great too. The little potato characters are surprisingly charming, and the variety of builds makes experimenting genuinely enjoyable. Plus, the game runs smoothly, loads instantly, and never gets in the way of the action.

If you like roguelikes, horde shooters, or just want something fast and ridiculously fun, Brotato is absolutely worth it. It’s one of those games that feels good from the first minute and keeps getting better the more you play.",True,0,0,1764172727

I really dug the gameplay loop during the six hours I played. The core mechanic involves testing out different combinations with the deck-building cards, removing weaker ones, and growing stronger to be able to face the final boss. Doing a run usually takes about 15–30 minutes, making it quick and fun. A unique aspect of Monster Train is that you must defend your pyre at the top of a train on three different floors while the enemies ascend.

There is no real story. And the graphical style is decent. It has a very Flash/mobile aesthetic, which isn't something I usually prefer.

But for two bucks, I got some solid enjoyment out of the main story and beating it. I can definitely see myself going back to use the different clan combinations (you choose a primary and an allied clan for each run) and other mechanics to have some fun here and there.

When this franchise began, it completely revolutionized not only basketball games, but sports games in general. The first 2k I played was 2k11 not because I really liked NBA basketball, but because I heard it was a really good video game. It was instant love. It felt like I was a professional athlete, with the most intuitive and perfect environment I had ever experienced in a sports game. It took my fandom of basketball to the next level and to this day, it's really the only sport I care about. But more than that, 2k is my ultimate comfort game. I've put thousands of hours into them collectively, from my career, to online, to just doing random play nows. If I don't know what to do or want to relax as easily as possible, I play 2k. Now we could get into how the franchise has changed over time and even I, a super fan, recognize it has gotten worse over time, but I still fundamentally feel it is as good a basketball game as one could exist, and the tiny things around it may change but that core experience doesn't. I do not think your enjoyment of this game is dependent on your love of basketball or even sports- it is perfectly executed and for anyone just diving in, it will likely become a comfort game for you too. All hail the king. 10/10",True,0,0,1763862970

Shovel Knight Dig,1089350,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Simulation, Sports",76561198367471798,"NBA 2K20 builds upon the franchise’s well-established foundation with a deep, polished basketball simulation that strives to balance realism, accessibility, and a wealth of content. Developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports, this installment refines core gameplay mechanics, introduces meaningful changes to player control and presentation, and offers an expanded career mode that showcases the series’ continued commitment to storytelling. While the game delivers an incredibly immersive on-court experience and a variety of game modes to satisfy different playstyles, it is also weighed down by persistent issues with microtransactions and monetization that affect the overall experience.

On the court, NBA 2K20 offers some of the most fluid and lifelike basketball mechanics to date. The player movement system feels more grounded, with better weight and momentum physics that make actions like driving to the hoop, defending, and transitioning between plays more realistic. Shot timing, dribbling, and passing have all received subtle but noticeable improvements, making skillful play more rewarding. The AI also feels more competent, with smarter defensive rotations and more natural off-ball movement from teammates. These refinements contribute to a satisfying gameplay loop that captures the nuances of real basketball.

The MyCareer mode is once again a major highlight, delivering an engaging story that blends Hollywood-level production with player customization and development. In NBA 2K20, players create their own character—nicknamed “Che”—and guide him through a dramatic journey from college basketball to the NBA. With a cast that includes Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson, the narrative touches on themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and personal growth, offering a surprisingly emotional arc that grounds the usual athletic rise-to-glory in a human story. Off the court, players can train, sign endorsements, and interact in the Neighborhood, a shared online social space that functions as a hub for various activities and modes.

MyTeam, the series’ fantasy team-building mode, returns with new challenges and card collections, but it remains one of the most contentious aspects of the game due to its heavy reliance on virtual currency. While the mode itself offers deep strategic gameplay and competitive appeal, the progression system can feel grind-heavy without spending real money. This creates a noticeable imbalance between players who invest time and those who spend cash, particularly when it comes to acquiring top-tier cards or competing online. The presence of microtransactions throughout various modes, including cosmetic upgrades in MyCareer, undermines the game’s otherwise strong design and alienates some players.

Presentation-wise, NBA 2K20 sets a high bar with authentic broadcast-style visuals, lifelike player models, and impressive arena atmospheres. The attention to detail is striking—everything from jersey movement and facial animations to crowd reactions and commentary is meticulously rendered. Commentary teams are dynamic and vary depending on the game, offering new insights and dialogue that keep games feeling fresh. The soundtrack, curated with a mix of hip-hop and mainstream hits, adds energy and modern flair, complementing the on-court action well. Audio design, from the bounce of the ball to the roar of the crowd, further enhances immersion.

Franchise mode, or MyLeague/MyGM, continues to offer one of the most comprehensive management simulations in sports gaming. With tools to control every aspect of a team—from roster decisions and finances to drafting and player morale—this mode remains a haven for strategic thinkers and NBA purists. The inclusion of detailed stats, historical data, and adjustable settings means players can craft the league of their dreams or recreate historical seasons. However, some fans may find that innovation in this area has slowed compared to other parts of the game.

In summary, NBA 2K20 excels in delivering a compelling and authentic basketball experience, thanks to its refined gameplay, deep modes, and immersive presentation. Its commitment to storytelling and realism is evident in every dribble, pass, and cutscene. Yet, the pervasive presence of microtransactions and the grindy nature of some modes hold it back from achieving its full potential. For fans of the sport, it’s still one of the best virtual representations of basketball available, but it also serves as a reminder of the growing tension between game design and monetization in modern sports titles.

The variety of weapons, abilities, and power-ups ensures no two runs feel the same, making every death feel like a learning experience rather than a setback.

The procedural levels are beautifully designed, blending consistency with unpredictability. You’ll explore sprawling castles, perilous biomes, and hidden areas, all teeming with enemies, secrets, and loot. Each run is a fresh challenge, keeping the game endlessly replayable.

Progression is rewarding and fair. Unlocking new weapons, mutations, and abilities encourages experimentation and creates a sense of growth across multiple runs. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and satisfaction, making every victory feel earned.

Visually, Dead Cells is stunning. Pixel art meets fluid animation in a style that’s both retro and modern. Coupled with an energetic soundtrack, the game’s atmosphere feels tense, vibrant, and utterly alive.

Final Verdict:
Dead Cells is a thrilling roguelike that combines fluid combat, clever design, and endless replayability. Challenging, rewarding, and endlessly fun, it’s a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed platformers and roguelikes.

“Fast, fluid, and endlessly rewarding — Dead Cells proves that roguelikes can be both challenging and exhilarating.”

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,9.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198017171604,"Continue?9876543210 is less a video game and more a strange meditation on mortality and meaning, wrapped in pixel art surrealism. You play as a recently “deleted” videogame character, wandering through liminal dreamscapes while trying to find purpose in the fleeting seconds before oblivion. It’s a premise that sounds bizarre on paper, but in practice it’s oddly affecting.

The experience is deliberately disorienting. Environments shift from neon-tinged ruins to unsettling voids, populated by fragmented NPCs who speak in riddles and philosophy. Sometimes you’re given small tasks or light combat, but the real draw is the mood: it’s melancholic, existential and often quietly beautiful.

Technically, the game is modest. The retro visuals are raw but evocative, the soundtrack experimental yet fitting and performance is smooth on just about any PC. That said, the mechanics can feel inconsistent and players looking for tight controls or conventional progression may find themselves frustrated. This isn’t about mastery, it’s about reflection.

What makes Continue?9876543210 stand out is how personal it feels. It’s one of those rare indie projects that dares to ask questions most games avoid: What does it mean to end? To fade? To accept? It won’t resonate with everyone - in fact, many will likely bounce off its strangeness - but those who connect with its wavelength may find it lingers long after the credits.

The good stuff- the idea is amazing, and the game captures the sense of hopelessness that wandering lost around the recesses of RAM might entail. I really like the dialogue too, which has a kind of meaningful meaningless quality, like haikus written by a gifted chimp. The music is quite good, and the basic organisation of the game (wandering around talking to people, finding clues, collecting game resources and then battling to save yourself) is well organised and a good idea for how to conduct this kind of game. So based on originality and thoughtfulness, it would be a 10/10.

However, the execution of the above gameplay is a solid 0/10, and since the gameplay is most of the game, it hurts the overall experience really badly. Generally, the game well captures the futility of trying to escape deletion because it is nigh impossible not to fail over and over and over again, based on flaws in the game mechanics rather than your skill. The combat is incredibly bad, making safe zones suddenly kill you, murdered enemies spring back to instantly and unavoidably shave off half your health (every enemy can do this), and enemies spawn teleported right on top of you to instantly initiate punishing combat with no chance to evade.

The punishment for failure also increase geometrically- every time you make a mistake, the punishment gets worse by 1. For reference, you need to build shelters towards surviving a storm every few levels, and each shelter takes a couple of conversations or minigames to build, with bigger (more effective) shelters taking more. Then when you fail, you lose a shelter. Fail twice, lose 2. Fail 5 times (throughout the whole playthrough), and you lose 5, then 6, then 7 shelters each time. Given how arbitrarily you fail, and that the game actively selects your biggest and most valuable shelters for deletion (i've played it enough to be sure this isn't random chance), the possiblity of getting past level 3 or 4 is extremely low for any given playthrough. Add in poor collision detection with environments (falling off parts of maps to your death), continue screens which also delete between 1 and 7 shelters every time, and randomised puzzles and level order, and you have a recipe for extremly consistent frustration. So I give the gameplay 0/10, with the developer either being really lazy on this element (doing no playtesting to realise what a piece of junk his game is to actually 'play') or really hostile to people who pay for his work (taking the 'avoiding deletion is really hard' story element as an excuse to ruin the gameplay element of the game).

I still really enjoyed Continue?, finding it artsy and thoughtful without being too pretentious. But being almost impossible to finish due to game design unfortunately takes it down quite a few notches.",True,3,0,1475629341

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,29.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198000829963,"I might have ruined this game a bit for myself by playing it too much in early access. I don't know what I wanted really but I don't think it's meaningfully different enough from the first game. It's more of the same with some new bells and whistles. If that's what you're looking for in a sequel I can't say I blame you. Playing it on full release with a fresh save file has just exacerbated some problems I have likely had since the original Hades. It's really an issue with roguelites in general. It's that I don't know how much better I'm actually getting at the game as opposed to me just hitting the arbitrary stat point that makes it just easy enough for me to succeed. I'm sure I am getting better at it, but I'm just bound to be successful eventually regardless of if I am or not really.

This is terrific for accessibility and likely why the genre as a whole has taken off like it has. I just don't think I'm into these kind of games as much anymore (rogueLITE specifically). The whole slow incremental statistical progress just leaves me thinking everything is just a matter of time. I don't know if I'll ever beat Slay the Spire on Ascension 20, but if I ever do I think I will feel like I earned it. There are of course difficulty modifiers in this game too and I think they help if you're looking to challenge yourself. I just might have a fundamental problem with the meta-progression aspect.

[h1][/h1]

While I haven't played the game *too* much (I bought it primarily to help support its development and out of interest for the setting), what I have seen is enjoyable and interesting and if you can find several people to play with, it should be a great great time. 

The main reason I am writing this review though is to say this: development might be a tad slow, but the devs are constantly dropping devblogs explaining *what* they're working on and *why* they're working on it - the most recent update showed off the complete removal of Unreal Engine's pathfinding system for a custom system which would allow the AI to better navigate the dirty, war torn environments of the game instead of getting stuck (as you may see complaints about). To me this means they're actively seeking out of the box ways to solve player complaints and make the best game they can. They're not compromising by cleaning and sterilizing the environment like so many modern shooters, they took the time to find a system that'll actually work well to facilitate future development while retaining their vision. 

Because of that, I give it a positive recommendation. If you're short on cash, wishlist it, but if you and a friend are interested then the game is definitely worth trying. It holds a lot of promise and it's constantly moving in the right direction. 

(Also, the emphasis on historical accuracy and respect for the setting really shows and is worth mentioning).",True,2,0,1764040692

I did all achievements, it took like 60h (while I spent some hours just being afk doing other things) and I think this game is pretty nice but not great. 

[b] Pros [/b]
- No bugs, works fluently 
- Cute characters
- Clear distinction between builds
- Progression system offers some creativity
- Each darkness level adds to the difficulty in a different way
- Weapons and character abilities are unique
- Upgrades are meaningful although a bit RNG-heavy but its normal in Roguelikes.

[b] Cons [/b]
- No magnetism to temporarily attract XP from all over the map which makes collecting XP tedious
- Builds are distinctive but there arent many
- Character abilities are unique in themselves but some are too similar to others or just useless (like Hastur)
- Bosses are always the same and it gets boring quick
- Barely any achievements motivating creative gameplay 
- Only 3 maps
- Not enough enemy variety
- Colour palette is always the same
- Progression system offers some creativity but is way too underwhelming and too simple

An overview of an ordinary player who grew up on Halo, but is not afraid to tell the truth.

---

When Microsoft announced Halo Infinite in 2020, fans around the world held their breath. After all, it wasn't just a new game — it was a promise to bring back the ""Golden Age"" of first-person shooters, an era when Halo 2 and Halo 3 forced schoolchildren to hide their Xbox under their desks in order to have time to play before the bell rang. However, what we got in the end is not just a game. This is a story about high ambitions, technical failures and an unexpected rescue.

---

🌌 Plot and atmosphere: ""The Master Chief is against everything""

Halo Infinite unfolds events immediately after the events of *Halo 5: Guardians*. Master Chief, one of the most iconic characters in the history of video games, finds himself alone on the destroyed Zeta Halo ring structure, with almost no memory and a broken suit. His ally is AI **The Weapon**, a conscious copy of Cortana, who is trying to figure out why she exists.

The plot doesn't break your brain, but it's atmospheric, emotional, and sometimes even philosophical. Especially if you've been following the saga from the beginning. There is no overload of dialogues or characters here — everything is focused on the Chief, his inner struggle and reconnecting with humanity. And yes, the finale leaves a light aftertaste... and a burning desire to see the sequel.

---

Gameplay: freedom, but with caveats

The company is, perhaps, the main trump card of Halo Infinite. Unlike its linear predecessors, here you will find an open world on a huge ring structure. You can explore locations, clear out the bases of banshee bandits, find secrets, upgrade the Chief's abilities - all this in a free manner.

The gameplay is back to basics: ** No exoskeletons**, **No teleporters** — just stormtroopers, shields, grenades and your mind. The Return of the Grappling Hook (Grappleshot)** it has become a game changer: with its help, you can both accelerate in battle and perform spectacular jumping tricks. You can feel the weight of the Chief's body — he's not a superhero, he's a soldier, and this has its own aesthetic.

However, **artificial intelligence** is a sore spot. Enemies often behave strangely, especially in difficult levels. It happens that the elites just stand and wait for their death, instead of attacking. It spoils the impression, especially when you want to feel challenged.

---

, Graphics and technical side

At the time of release (December 2021), Halo Infinite looked like... ** modestly **. Many fans criticized her for her ""plastic"" graphics and empty landscapes. But Microsoft and studio 343 Industries** did something that developers rarely do — they  listened to the community.

Over the past two years, the game has received ** many updates**: improved terrain texture, added dynamic lighting and weather, redesigned animations. Today, Halo Infinite looks the way it should have looked when it was released — beautiful, large-scale, epic.

---

🕹️ Multiplayer: Chaos, but fun

Multiplayer in Halo Infinite is free — and this is a bold step. It brings back the classic gameplay: Slayer, Capture the Flag, Big Team Battle** on huge maps with tanks and helicopters. All this works on an updated version of the Slipspace Engine, created specifically for this game.

Problems? Yes, they were. At the start — inconvenient menu,  lack of rating modes,  problems with weapon balance. But gradually 343 Industries fixed everything. Today, multiplayer is a **live community** where beginners can practice and veterans can hone their skills.

---

Historical context: from Bungie to 343 Industries

Halo was born within the walls of Bungie, a studio that gave us not only a cult shooter, but also a cultural phenomenon. The first game was released in 2001 exclusively on Xbox and became a ""system game"" — without it, the console simply did not make sense.

But in 2007, Bungie left Microsoft, leaving the franchise in the hands of an internal studio, 343 Industries, named after one of the AI characters in the Halo universe. At first, fans were skeptical about the change of creators, but Halo 4 (2012) and Halo 5 (2015) Proved that the spirit of the series is alive.

Halo Infinite was conceived as a **relaunch**, but with respect for the legacy. And although its development was accompanied by layoffs, leaks and internal conflicts, the game eventually became what many were waiting for: ** a love letter to fans from themselves**.

---

Conclusion: is it worth playing?

yes. Necessarily.  
Halo Infinite is not perfect, but it is ** honest**. It shows that even in the era of battle royales and loot boxes, it is possible to make a shooter in which the main values are freedom, tactics and a sense of adventure.

If you:
- we grew up on Halo 2 over a LAN network,
- Do you want to experience nostalgia with a modern look,
- just looking for a high-quality shooter with a soul,

— then **Halo Infinite** is your choice.

And if you don't believe me, just download the multiplayer for free and see for yourself: The chief is still in business**.

Most of the time I didn't have issues with the sports game they introduce (in fact game feel is excellent) but, for a gameplay device that, as I understand, is meant to add spice to what is otherwise a visual novel, it feels very strange to have to deal with the typical ""+5% jump distance"" elements, which I often frown upon in other games. Just like in those, eventually they add very little to the mix. Did Pyre really need merchants, gathering plants, etc.?

Gameplay might SEEM offputting, but once you take a second to actually learn it, it's great. Fifa with a bunch of movement mechanics. 

Big recommendation. Supergiant as made multiple of my favorite games ever.

Cult of the Lamb,1205140,0.0,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Free To Play, Indie",76561199107273601,"Игра 'Kika & Daigo: A Curious Tale' очаровала меня своим уютным визуальным стилем и необычной механикой сотрудничества. Играть за двух совершенно разных персонажей, Кику и Дайго, каждый из которых обладает уникальными способностями, оказалось очень интересно. Головоломки заставляют мыслить нестандартно и требуют слаженной работы в паре, что делает процесс прохождения крайне увлекательным, особенно в кооперативном режиме.

Сюжет, хоть и незамысловатый, подается с трогательной наивностью, создавая приятную атмосферу приключения. Персонажи милые и запоминающиеся, а мир игры полон ярких деталей и сюрпризов. Отдельно хочу отметить музыкальное сопровождение, которое идеально дополняет визуальный стиль и создает расслабляющую атмосферу.

Несмотря на простоту геймплея, игра способна увлечь на несколько часов, предлагая приятный и неспешный геймплей.

Dark Souls III,374320,29.99,17,solo/multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198317024202,"Dark Souls III is the best Dark Souls game.

The extreme difficulty remains balanced throughout whilst punishing mistakes and greediness. The boss fights are excellent with a few exceptions. The hardest bosses are in the two DLCs with some having up to three phases! These bosses are accompanied by an impeccable soundtrack.

The game in general feels a lot smoother and faster paced compared to Dark Souls II with the level design being less confusing. Boss runbacks have been reduced with heavy emphasis on shortcuts, with the longest being Oceiros, the Consumed King at one minute fifteen seconds and the shortest being Slave Knight Gael at four seconds! There is Dark Souls 1 nostalgia included here, such as the return of Blacksmith Andre, Anor Londo, Asylum Demon and Capra Demon corpses scattered throughout Smouldering Lake, as well as the Stone Demon enemy from Lost Izalith. 

The ""Focus Points"" (FP) system returns from Demon's Souls to perform miracles, sorceries, pyromancies and weapon/shield ""Skills"" which allow for special attacks and abilities. Performing these actions drain your FP bar, which is the blue line underneath the red HP bar. FP doesn't regenerate, so you have to consume an Ashen Estus Flask. You can choose whether you would rather have more Estus Flasks (for healing) or Ashen Estus Flasks by talking to Blacksmith Andre.

The poetic storytelling makes a return with a very worthy final boss of the base game and both DLCs. NPC side quests make a return, with most worth pursuing to acquire certain items, such as a Titanite Slab, Silvercat Ring and the Pyromancy Flame being the most useful.

Dark Souls III contains new additions such as a red cross next to weapons that you don't have the correct stats for. The Homeward Bone can take you to Firelink Shrine or the last Bonfire rested at, unlike previous Dark Souls games. Upgrading armour sets have been removed. A new stat called ""Luck"" has been added which is useful for farming rare Covenant items and upgrade materials. Estus soup is a new healing station that refills your HP, but there are only three of them in Lothric.

Alas, covenants in this game don't benefit PvE as they're more suited to PvP, unlike previous Dark Souls games.

Easily the best Dark Souls game and a fantastic way to conclude the series.",True,0,0,1764173787

Every boss made me rage, every mini-boss humbled me, and every new area felt like some fresh form of punishment designed personally for me. But the moment you finally learn the patterns, tighten your parries, and land that finishing blow? Pure dopamine!!!

The combat is sharp, fast, and brutally honest. If you mess up, it's on you. If you succeed, it’s because you earned it. That’s the magic of this game, it makes you better not just in skill but in patience and mindset. 

The world is stunning, the soundtrack is perfect, and every encounter feels handcrafted to push you just past your limit. It’s challenging, it’s unforgiving, but it’s also insanely rewarding. Once you get that “I understand it now” moment you will feel unstoppable.

In it's way, it's art. An absurd, weird, gross, horrific and original 3D first person rogue-like horror. First runs can feel senseless, but little by little most of the game world will make sense.

I will say, the story is by far the strongest part of this game. I also really like that the devs tried a new spin on the genre, by adding interesting movement abilities. However, the levels were a bit too simple to really let these shine (even when backtracking, these abilities were used in pretty simplistic ways). 
The combat was okay, there were only a couple of weapon types (though they came with different special attacks, they were largely the same). The enemy variety was good considering the short runtime. 
The combat overall was really easy even w/o the assist mode. The bosses were a letdown - they were incredibly easy, and didn't really have any moves or combos to worry about. Also, their attack hitboxes were *really* bad - a lot of them you could just hug and they'd not be able to hit you with most of their attacks.

It is typical of a dark souls type of game with steep learning curve and monsters that respawn after each death or interaction with saving point.

In other games, where monsters do not respawn after each death and saving point, I usually play on adventure mode, like the step above story mode, but never hard core mode. I get tired of the unending grinding of games like this, where your progress don't mean shit if you havent reached a saving point. Killing 50 monsters just to die to the boss, and then having to kill them all again, is not my idea of fun.

Big plus that they have added ""assist"" mode so you can play more as in a story mode or similar to enjoy the game more, avoiding the unending grinding and actually be able to finish the game, even as an average player.

The tutorial/first level of this is by far the most difficult part and if you can get by that on default difficulty, then you can beat the game easily.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561197970842874,"Played the game for almost 25 hours (Steam time) at time of writing the review, I have completed a NG run and done all side quests playing an engineering/ alchemy build, I plan on doing NG+ runs and getting the DLC.

I paid £1.69 for this game and my review would be exactly the same had I paid the full Steam price. I knew almost nothing about the game before going in apart from it was a 'soulslike' with average reviews, being able to get the game so cheap is why I bought it.

I really enjoyed this game, there's lots to really like and it does a lot of things better than other 'soulslikes', looking at you LIes of P.

First thing I will say is when you make your character pick a realistic skin tone/face, one the black ones is actually beautiful. A geisha robot may look cool at first but the cut scenes look ridiculous and the more realistic face does play into the story.

It seems to be commonly known the game has issues, I'm usually able to run game on high overall graphics setting  at 80-100fps or ultra at 50-60fps. On this I had to play the game on medium overall settings capped at 59fps. The game does have, for a lack of a better term, a 'janky' feel to it but without playing it on a very high end PC I don't know whether that is caused by performance or just that's how the game is, part of me thinks it's both as you do play as a robot and all the enemies are robots so some the movement design may be contributing to that janky feel. However none of this affected my enjoyment of the game.

The game does a lot of really good things. Combat, build variety and level design are ones that I'll touch on. 

The game has the typical 'soulslike' stat equivalents of ST, DX, health, stamina but the two interesting ones are it's version of magic is elemental alchemy and the stat called engineering. Alchemy dictates how strong attacks using weapons that have one of the games three elemental types (frost, fire, electric) are and engineering increases your armour stat, increases the damage multiplier for status effect and increases loot drop. 

These two stats really synergies well together because instead of having a magic meter for using weapons elemental attacks that you recharge at rest points or replenish with items (which you can do) you have a set number of uses of these alchemy attacks and the main way you recharge the alchemy uses is from loot drops from enemies, 90% of enemies drop either health or alchemy charges or grenades but increasing the loot drop stat increases the number of items dropped. It's a really interesting synergy and I appreciate the thought that has gone into it.

My play-through was using this alchemy/engineering synergy but I would like to experiment with other builds as the weapons in the game encourage different play-styles. There's no block or parry abilities as default but some weapon types do have them as abilities. I played as fast attacking elemental build using elemental damage from my weapons to quickly build up status whilst dodging enemy attacks, you could play a counter attacking style using your weapons counter attacks to do big damage and knock enemies back and use grenades to inflict status. Stamina management is very important as you become immobile if you fully drain the bar so a stamina build for constant movement and attack could be an option.

Level design is somewhere I think the game really shines. At first the game feels relatively linear with the usual go forward, find a shortcut back to the rest point etc. But as you progress through the game you'll start to notice doors with certain locks or high ledges with items on that you can't access as well as the areas starting to opening up. This is because the areas aren't linear they are actually quite large and open with multiple routes and lots to explore, as you go through the game you unlock traversal abilities that allow you to access these areas. The side quests in the game do a really good job of encouraging you to go back to the these areas and access new sections using the traversal abilities.

I really have to commend the devs on the areas they've designed, it would have been so easy to just make a game like Lies of P, whose areas look like long corridors in comparison.

Another thing the devs need a commending on is the story and lore, mixing in real world historical events with a sci-fi story is difficult and then basing a game around it is difficult and I respect what they've attempted.

As this is 'soulsike' difficulty needs to be mentioned. First thing I need to mention and another shout out to the devs heres is that the game has almost no cheesey enemies or BS. This game falls in line with almost every other game of the genre in that the standard enemies are not too difficult and you may die occasionally as you learn enemy attacks, develop strategies on how to deal with encounters and such. 

But where this game really differs is in terms of difficulty is the bosses. I died about 5 times on the first boss then almost every other boss afterwards I beat on 1st or 2nd attempt. I've really been off put by games where it takes me hours to beat a boss and you essentially have to be able to beat them perfectly to beat them at all, so on one hand it's refreshing to not have to deal with that but I would like to have seen them a little tougher. 
The main source of the games difficulty comes from having to deal with groups of enemies. Enemies do hit hard and they can hit very quick. In the final section of the game there were a few sections where I had to deal with groups of strong enemies that just felt impossible but these were in large areas where I could just run past to nearby rest place, which does make me think these may have been implemented as intentional resource farming spots.

Apart from the performance issues I don't have any major criticisms but I do have some minor ones. The character really needs a lantern or light device, this is common in 'soulslikes', to light up areas, Some of the very dark areas one does appear but there are a lot of other areas where this would have been really beneficial as your character can almost blend in to the environments and if there's not other light sources the game can look dull. The game is also quite buggy, I had plenty of occasions where I would be taken to the desktop, game still running on pause and I had about 4 occasions where the game just full on stopped. I'm not sure if it's a bug but there were a few occasions where I would use a rest place, quit the game then when I come back my character would be nowhere near the rest place I was at when I last played.

Overall I've really enjoyed my time with Steelrising so far, exploring the games world, combat and building my character have been really enjoying. I have to give a lot of respect to what the devs have tried to do here because there is so much of it that's well done, it's  just a shame about the performance issues. I don't know much about them but I'm hoping they get to keep on making games and improving on what they've done.",True,2,0,1762598115

Marvel Rivals,2357570,0.0,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Free To Play",76561198048177624,"I have played Overwatch 1 and 2 for over 3,000 hours since the first anniversary in 2017.

At launch and within the first seasons of Overwatch 2, Overwatch was possibly at its worst in terms of player trust and enjoyment factor. Outside of the political and company drama and allegations, it did not launch with the originally promised PvE, which the community was told not long before launch, as well as the sudden fundamental shift from 6v6 to 5v5 and being unable to return to Overwatch 1.

Now that we are in Season 19 and dramatic changes have occurred such as Microsoft's acquisition, the shift from Overwatch League to Overwatch Champions Series for esports, the frequent changes and updates with new content, game modes, and characters, Overwatch 2 IS NOT Overwatch 1, though I believe it has settled into a comfortable rhythm as a live service game. It has been well-optimized and gone through the growing pains of development. It still has bugs and many things that can be improved, but this is a game that you can easily pick up and play in any way you  are wanting to.

Pros:
- Multiple ways to play: Quick Play Role Queue or 6v6 Open Queue, Mystery Heroes, Competitive 5v5 & 6v6, rotating Arcade game modes, Stadium Quick Play or Competitive, and a fairly robust Custom Games browser WITH a workshop.
- Many heroes to play or try in each role, with one new hero every 2 seasons. There HAS to be at least one hero you will like to play.
- Largely dynamic cosmetics (lootboxes were brought back) and no pay-to-win, Mythic skins OVER TIME aren't locked to the Battle Pass anymore (a currency now but still has to be purchased and rewarded from playing)
- Regular updates
- Accessibility features and highly customizable options & settings
- Map voting (still needs some work)
- Hero bans in Competitive (also still needs work)
- Ping system
- Toxicity, slurs, and other social discourtesies are not endorsed by the developers and are often cracked down on.
- Very visible Competitive SR system (dramatic shift since OW2 launch). Finally added Leaver Compensation in Competitive.
- Matchmaking is actually really good, especially in Competitive. Of course there will ALWAYS be human factors. Unpopular opinion, I know.
- Cares for its streamers

Neutral:
- Not as much artistic expression as before but can still dish out interesting cosmetics
- Hit-or-miss collaborations and Battle Passes
- Practice Range
- Perks add more info bloat to the already visually-cluttered gameplay experience but can also make it more interesting
- Balancing is a menace
- Meta is not as strict as before

Cons:
- Bloated with features, information, and visual effects that can be overwhelming
- Menus can be confusing to navigate and some stats are missing
- Console is the younger sibling that gets all the hand-me-downs and late updates
- Frustrating gameplay (as is typical in pvp), particularly in its identity when it comes to balance changes (one-shots or not? CC or not? Counterswapping or not?)
- Certain heroes get more cosmetics love than others... I'm looking at you, Kiriko, Juno, etc.
- Certain pre-existing game modes like Archives and Competitive Mystery Heroes are non-existent
- Tutorial and how-to-play experience is still lacking
- Looking-for-Group is not in OW2
- Disciplinary action appeals are not fleshed out enough yet. My advice is to practice self-control so you don't have to grapple with this.

Just be warned that it is continually building upon its disciplinary action features. Toxicity is frowned upon by the devs, which, in my opinion, should be normalized. I don't care if it's ""normal in other PvP games"" to be toxic or display poor sportsmanship. This is a video game with other people, so be courteous and be the better person.

Overwatch has had its major ups and downs, times that it was a good game and times that it was a bad game. Play it if you want to, don't play it if you don't want to. But to me, Overwatch will always be an easy comfort-pick in terms of gameplay loop, personal expression, socializing with friends, and competitive integrity. It's so much more fleshed out than many other hero shooters because of its long runtime and passionate development, even through Blizzard's long and controversial history.

Don't take it too seriously. Unless it's your job to play professionally. YES, you can have fun. Don't follow the crowd, okay? You can actually learn a lot of great lessons just from experiencing all that the game and community has to offer... or frustrate you with.",True,0,0,1764173470

The requirements for a perfect clearing of the levels fail to trigger making a perfect game a crap shoot; you fail stealth sections without any alerted enemies

every weapon you get sucks and the level clear penalty for your material makes upgrading weapons a chore

the exploration is as shallow as can be and literally crap compared to shovelware like ""mad max"" (mad max is a bad game but at least it DOESNT PENALIZE YOU FOR THE SCRAP YOU COLLECT EVERY TIME YOU CLEAR A REGION FOR ""REPAIRS"")

The enemies are bullet sponges and playing on any difficulty higher than normal is just garbage. they shoot you from across the map in fog you cant see through then take several shots to the hear AFTER THEIR HELMET AND MASK FLY OFF

I dont remember this game sucking that bad at launch and didnt review it but holy crap i cant recommend this game at all. just read the books, its sad that all of the metro games suck but they changes this to play more like stalker. like i seriously just want to wander in the wastes and collect trinkets and shoot the occasional skag/hostile scavenger, this is all just artificially difficult to pad out playtime. i remember how short this crap is and on my current playthrough i havent even stolen the strain yet and ive died 30+ times. 

Do not buy this game and if you do play it on normal bc its just trying to pass the 2 hour refund deadline; NOTHING you do in the rest of the game minus that stupid gas filled tunnel on the third map are as hard as this horrible intro. like they have seriously made the intro as bad as atomic hearts for some reason.

Don't get me wrong I enjoy exploring and the combat is also very fun, but running around a map maybe TEN TIMES the size of the biggest level in Last Light while having the stamina of a newborn baby gets very annoying very quickly. Sure you get a car sometimes but having to get in and out of the car after the 50th time when scavenging or exploring gets super annoying, even though its only a few seconds of an animation.

HELLDIVERS 2,553850,31.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198108256612,"As a massive fan of the original game, I do not like the sequel. It feels like less of a co-op game and more of a ""everyone split up and do their own thing"" kind of game because the game is designed in ways that punish you for wanting to stay together with your teammates so it just feels heavily discouraged. Enemy spawns struggle to split between 4 players in different parts of the map so it results in the hardest difficulty feeling hilariously easy at times when one or more people barely get any spawns and just freely do objectives, but if you stay together you all get all the enemies spawns pretty much all the time which just ends up wasting so much time.

Helldivers 1 was built, designed, and balanced a lot around co-op centric things, your team had far more reason to have different roles and loadouts instead of making a strong versatile build that can do everything independently, team reload mechanic was a much stronger and encouraged mechanic, and the team was not allowed to be separated.

A lot of strategems and weapons also just feel worse than the HD1 counterparts in terms of damage, ammo economy, and general effectiveness. The standard Breaker shotgun and the Kinetic Shield are some of the worst offenders to me.

HD2 also lacks some crucial teamwork focused strategems that people like me desperately want back, such as the Rep-80 heal beam gun, or the Angel Guard dog medical backpack. The stim pistol was not a fun addition to the game as trying to hit people with that is insufferable, I don't care if people say it's skill issue, it is not fun, and not like it's very effective anyway cause players tend to die faster than it can heal anyway.

Player survivability in HD2 also just does not feel as fair or as fun as HD1 too. The incap system was completely removed so you just outright die (Gives another less incentive to use SMG's compared to HD1, hell you can't even carry artillery shells with one hand and shoot a one handed weapon at the same time anymore either), and weak enemies can even kill you in just a mere few hits sometimes. The games survivability relying so much on stims is not particularly a design choice I like either. I wish they kept the incap system and players being a bit tankier, and you had very very slow health regen instead if you arn't taking damage. (Stims should of been something in the grenade slot instead to replace grenades in my opinion.)

I don't like how armor went from a cosmetic only thing in HD1 so you could wear what you want and select the perk you wanted separately, to now armor passives have to be handcuffed to armors that I don't want to wear while the ones I want to wear have awful passives or ones I really don't want to use cause it won't complement my build. Which is rather annoying.

Performance and game stability is also not particularly great either. This game used to run well on my system early on but after a bunch of updates it feels like it really struggles to be stable, I know they started trying to address this though it's still not anywhere near how well the game used to run yet. (I acknowledge more major engine tech stuff may take time, but felt I'd mention this.)

I donno, maybe it's a hot take, but I do not like this game because it took away the biggest thing I praised the original for and that's feeling like a true co-op designed experience first and foremost, where lone wolf gameplay was actively discouraged. I don't like some of the other design decisions/changes too. I'd only recommend this game if you are okay with it being nothing like the original game, the game itself isn't terrible, but as an original fan it feels too alienating for me, like it was catoring to a completely different audience for the sake of being mainstream. 

There's a lot more I'm probably forgetting off the top of my head right now, so I'll end it with this. TLDR: I wish this game just tried to be more like HD1 in almost all aspects but with the third person perspective change and with more content/features, not drastically change or redesign things that worked just fine before.",False,2,0,1764159083
HELLDIVERS 2,553850,31.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561197983680833,"I enjoyed the idea of a game where all players are working together instead of against one another, where all efforts are for the whole team rather than yourself. Playing with my friends was a blast as we tried many different combinations and weapons to tackle bugs, bots, and otherwise. While the game was fun in the beginning, the game now feels like a slog or chore. The personal secondary objectives to get medals used to be ""Use X gun for Y kills"" or ""Use an airstrike or sentry gun for Y kills."" Now it's always ""Collect samples"" or ""Evac 3 times from a faction-specific map."" The major orders follow suit with them just being ""Hold planet Z because why not?""

The samples I've collected have been in my inventory for over a year now; having upgraded my personal ship to the maximum, I don't think there will be any personal ship upgrades in the future or at all. 

The enemies are slanted towards the bugs last time I played, with them having numerous updates/upgrades from invisibility to flying acid dragons and fog-spewing chargers, while the bots do have different types of the flamethrower variety. It would be pretty cool if they had ships dispersing fog or invisible patrols or had fighting styles like the Illuminate.

But! you may be thinking, didn't they patch it? Surely it's all fixed now right, why the hate?

To which I direct you to take-two's EULA for not just this game, but everything they have a hand in. Even in absentia of the horrific anti-consumer practices that gearbox themselves are guilty of going back as far as them embezzling funding from SEGA to use on their own projects, if you look at the EULA that Take-Two is now making mandatory on virtually all of their games you will find that they have declared for themselves the rights to access and collect the following information:

-Your name
-Your Email
-Your phone number
-Your photo
-Your mailing address/zip code
-payment or purchase info
-age
-gender
-password
-platform ID
-Software products played
-Survey data

-and the systems or platforms you play their product on/through.

Furthermore, they also ""share"" (read:sell), your information with the following:

-Vendors that perform services and support for them
-Take-Two group members
-Advertisers and third party advertising partners
-Other third parties

I realize that I'm going to most assuredly get flamed for daring to mention these things, likely by a bunch of addict lobotomites who are perfectly willing to sell their privacy, and any dignity or self-respect under the auspices that no one will actually come to collect on them personally, but as someone who purchased this game and played it for ages long before the IP was unceremoniously sold off and gutted by a company I despise due to their long history of abusing their customers, I cannot overstate how much I despise this entire series of events.

And yes, the truth is we're all trapped in this awful market environment, run roughshod over by corporate interests and information brokering thieves, but to have it so blatantly done to a game I loved, and considered one of the best in the genre? To see it literally become unplayable in a proper state for a year before they actually fixed things, and have everything unique and fun about it be dragged out and abused for all it's worth by unscrupulous corporate asshairs who couldn't give a shit less about something that was until that point, crowd funded and beloved by its community? It's like purchasing a car and then a decade later the company changes hands and they break into your house and reengineer every part of your vehicle to function worse so they can sell you back the parts they just stole from you. We aren't renters, we are owners of these things, at least we damn well should be for the amount of money we pay for these products. Enough is enough.

I cannot, and will not support this, and I say if you have any respect for yourself or what this game was before they infested it, cut them off. Let something new take its place someday, and God willing let that indie dev not decide to sell out their baby to the devil.",False,1,0,1764143256

The scope of the game has stretched it so thin, and despite some amazing work from the art team, including the sweet OST by Donglekumquat, it wastes so much of its effort on creating games that are destined to go unplayed, or forever be half-baked.

For a social game, Tower Unite is really bad at incentivising being social, and that is no more apparent than in the highly popular casino, where about half the lobby will be pressing their space bar for hours on end at the slots, while the adjacent poker hall, a game perfect for social interactions with strangers, sits empty. The Arcade is full of minigames, yet only a handful of the 20+ are even multiplayer, and the ones that really payout are once again just mindnumbingly pressing the space bar for hours on end. 
The game's poor balancing of rewards can encourage players to be antisocial.

Tower Unite is capable of putting out genuinely great games, I would still hold its Minigolf as one of the best out there, and you can easily lose yourself in its condo system for hours with how much possibility it has, but so much of its development has gone towards things that are pointless, games that are buggy, unbalanced, or simply lack the demand. 

A social game doesn't demand a weak quake imitator requiring years of development when most of its other features are still incomplete.

Don't support this game's echo chamber and hive mind/mob mentality. 
Initially starting out on this game I was impressed by the creative capabilities with condos and the amount of activities you could do with friends, so much so that I purchased one of the supporter packs. I'm a pretty reserved person so I don't speak up too often but after playing for a while in the plaza with my friends I began to notice the same kinds of people coming on making inflammatory statements, sexual comments, and just downright degeneracy. Then you look at their Steam profiles and see that many of those who frequent this game are SEVERELY detached from society, mentally unwell, and/or promote unhealthy things (like ""consensual"" sexual content with those who are underage). They seem to go by a ""we don't take care of things unless they're reported"" mentality unless you're speaking out against their hypocrisy, THAT is when you get some kind of ban as I have seen and heard of from many players, friend and not. They claim to defend against things like bigotry and certain figures so they can use those things as a blanket statement to silence what they don't agree with. I had a friend having a proper cordial discussion with a trans individual about how we should help take care of the trans community's mental health when they're young instead of just thrusting them onto HRT when someone came up and started harassing my friend, yelling over them, making load noises with items, and acting like my friend was being transphobic (they certainly are not and stated such several times). Evidently, after those 2 individuals went off to ""chat"" my friend was banned the very next day for HARASSING after never receiving so much as a warning prior to this. I can go into even more detail on other instances of inappropriate moderation but this review is already long enough and I'm honestly done with this game.",False,34,3,1760948030

Since RE7 came out about 3 years after Alien Isolation, i really expected there to be a much more open map, or options to fight back against anyone else than the molded. After all, the invincible family promote exactly the same gameplay as the Alien: stalk and hide. 
Amnesia: The Bunker clearly had the same aspirations, and took a tighter designed approach to its core loop with an algorithmically randomized bunker that prompts the player to figure it out on their own, instead of bombarding them with duller and duller chase sequences.

But everytime you are allowed roam around an area at your own pace you are either set up for the next jumpscare (eta <2 minutes), or you just fight molded. Large goo guys. They have big heads that burst open on headshots. They walk as if they have a stick up their ass. And they are veeeery boring, i even remember how dull i found them when i first played it. And unlike the first RE games, there is no real way to walk by them without wasting large amounts of ammo. sad.

I never made it to the ending since i heard that was where the molded stuff peaks, and i feel i've REALLY seen enough of it by now.

Its a great concept but far too much going on to make it playable. Its almost like you are racing against yourself, clicking around trying to keep up to attacks, unhappy people, research, building, resources, planting. You reach a point where you have too much to tend to your people become useless and die.  
It becomes a frantic click this click that, this person is smashing his own stuff, out of wood, no food, attack, click on each person individually put them in defend mode then place them where they need to be. Why they don't just attack when invaded I do not know, instead they will stand there with an AK-47 and die. 

You find yourself pausing the game constantly making adjustments then high speed then pause. Otherwise, your stuff gets destroyed and you don't even realise. Playing on regular speed is far too slow and high is far too fast. So its fast to pause, pause to fast, fast to pause. Its incredibly frustrating. 
There is just too much going on to be clicking around and reviewing every single tiny detail. Pause, Play,Pause,Play,Pause,play, I've never played a game where I spend more time on pause than Playing.

If I make someones job a wood cutter. I don't want to have to tell them constantly where to cut and how much.(maybe make it so they cut AND replant the area)?
Being able to set mining depth would be nice, instead of locked in 3 blocks.
Pick and plant farms would be nice also. Instead of picking randomly and planting later. 
The structures are too week. I don't even bother making steel walls or fences now because you use up valuable resources repairing them. They are just destroyed too easily.
Having your armed people fight when threatened would be good. I thought there was a way to set that without constantly pausing and manually doing it but maybe i'm thinking of something else.

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198043763489,"I really enjoyed Gwent when it was part of Witcher 3 and was happy to be a part of the beta for the game when it first came out. I then forgot about the game and didnt play it for quite sometime, I played again around the Ciri Journey right before the Witchers set. My favorite decks were Devo Symbiosis, Thrive Monsters, Point Slam Monsters, Firesworn Swarm, and Northern Realm Siege Engines and sometimes Reavers. I had a great time with the game back then and got to Rank 2 on the ladder, I never hit Pro Ladder because at the time it felt like Nilfgard was incredibly oppresive to me. I stopped playing again for quite some time.

Recently I tried playing again and after giving the game some time to relearn the cards and the meta, I can tell you the game fucking SUUUCKS now. It feels terrible. The player councils have nerfed anything that remotely feels fun. The game feels VERY reactive now, and decks with high complexity are pushed way further than simple fun decks. The game feels oppresive to new players and is VERY unforgiving and overall just not worth playing. 

The player council balance factions are adverserial against each other and will frequnetly just tit for tat nerf/buff decks that they prefer. It feels awful. If you are a new player stay away, while the game is built to be rewarding, it is also very punishing and unfriendly in the sense that you will be made to feel like a loser for not having any powerful decks, you will repeatedly be farmed by better players for A LOOOOONG time before you get anywhere.  

If you are a returning player, you should stay away, long gone are the days of playing big splashy cards that feel fun to put on the board, and instead the game has been replaced with what essentially feels like two blue players in MTG playing counterspells against each other for 3 rounds. Instead of trying to buff all the bad cards to be more powerful and fun, the game has pretty much nerfed all of what used to be good impactful cards, and buffed meaningless reactionary cards so that the game tilts way into rewarding reactive players just for being reactive and punishing proactive for daring to do anything. 

Stay away and dont waste your money and time. The game feels awful now, its frustrating that I cant ever go home again to when I was playing the game, but it is what it is. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.

Additionally the game interface has several display bugs now that used to not be present, and will not update even after you complete quests, which can feel infuriating. The quests for the seasons feel unfairly difficult to complete for the amount of rewards you get.  

The community on reddit is borderline toxic, with a lot of player refusing to see the other side of the argument and are just paritsan and unhelpful. They want to turn Gwent from something which was fun for a majority of players to a game that is focused on just appealing to the top 10% of ladder and players and thats it. They could care less about anyone else, to them that's balance and fun. If you dare to complain they just say you can't understand their grand vision.

Don't expect any meaningful changes or updates to the meta, it will continue to degrade until its just the most boring/meaningless cards in the world being buffed while anything that could even remotely fun or powerful continues to get nerfed.

I used to love old JRPGS on SNES and PSX, but there was the perceived freedom that you were in an open world. This game just throws you in a PS2-like linear minimap that you have to navigate and inevitably come across a minimap boss that looks like it's come from the Dark Souls series.

This WOULD be the greatest turn-based rpg I have EVER played.

WOULD. The truth though, is that this game stutters so badly and so frequently it is practically unplayable in Acts 2 and 3. Your game is going to be a little bit choppy in Act 1, worse in populated areas; you'll forgive it, because you're enjoying the story and game so much. Then Act 2 will come, and it will get worse. Cutscenes are now a choppy mess, character dialogue is constantly glitching out, so you're constantly pulled out of immersion. But you're invested at this point, so you sludge through the glitchiness to Act 3.

Then when your refund-window is LONG expired, and you're coming out of Act 2 finally on your way to Baldurs gate, and the truly performance-intensive areas are finally here... oh boy, it is bad. Non-stop stuttering, there is not one spoken word that isn't choppy, and the game truly becomes unplayable. I cannot believe a GOTY game performs like this.

If this game stopped being a roguelite, this would be so much better game. If either:
1) It added a checkpoint system every few levels so you don't have to start from the beginning again.
or, 2) It got rid of all upgrades and unlocked all abilites and weapons from the very start and ending this game was purely based on skill.

Either one of those and I would be actually playing the game to the end because it's such a cool game to play with especially on a handheld. In the current state I can only recommend it if you get someone's save file or a mod that does either of the above two things, otherwise I don't recommend any roguelite and that includes this game.

Roguelites have blown up in popularity but people have forgot how little dopamine hits every now and then can be really addicting and can really suck you in and just feels like you're progressing or having fun while inside your head, you're just agitated, nervous and fucking terrifed of dying in a video game.",False,1,1,1764040203

Interesting character dynamics, fun varied combat, challenging but satisfying combat, all around I enjoyed nearly all of that 50 hours; But you wanna know why I have an extra 30 hours? 

Achievement hunting, specifically ONE Achievement. Now, I'll be the bigger man and won't spoil what it was, but I'll explain a bit about this game's rouge-like element. Each of the games zones are made out of rooms. Combat, challenges, survive etc. There's a particular type of room called Encounter Rooms. They often give great benefits. Issue is, they're also bloody rare. You can go 10-20 runs without seeing one. To get 3 achievements, you need to find each of the 3 zones encounter rooms and that's not all. Some of these achievements can only be done AFTER finishing the prior one so if you low-ball cant get a certain encounter in a previous zone, you're SOOL for a while. 

Worse part is, you can customize the difficulty of your runs, you can make Zagreus stronger or weaker as you see fit, but all that pales to the sheer fact you cant control Encounter Rooms. It's literal RNG baked into the game. So you really can't cheese this outside letting the mobs kill you after wasting 15 minutes into a run.

Overall, Great game but the encounter rooms made it overstay its welcome. Won't immediately try out Hades 2 now its fully released But I hope they did fix this of all things.

	I've sunk over a thousand hours into 7 Days to Die over the years, a testament to how fantastic this game [b] used to be. [/b] The core concept of a voxel-based zombie survival crafting game is brilliant, and for a long time, it delivered some truly memorable experiences. The issue is that the game I fell in love with is not the game it is today, and the developers (""The Fun Pimps"") seem intent on a cycle of endless, often regressive, change rather than refinement.

	My lack of recommendation comes down to one core problem: the developers constantly redesign fundamental systems from the ground up with almost every major update. Instead of building on existing mechanics, they scrap them entirely, forcing veteran players to re-learn a ""new"" game every single time. This isn't early access refinement; it's a lack of vision.

    • [b] Scrapped Mechanics: [/b] We've seen multiple iterations of progression systems, from the ""learn by doing"" model to the current perk and magazine-based system. Each change feels like a sideways step, often removing depth and features that the community enjoyed (like empty jars or specific meat types) for no apparent reason other than change for change's sake.

    • [b] Forced Playstyles: [/b] Recent updates have introduced systems like biome progression tied to loot stages, which can feel linear and removes the open-world freedom that was a hallmark of earlier alphas. Base designs and creative building approaches that players developed over time are often patched out, forcing specific, developer-approved play styles.

    • [b] An ""Eternal Early Access"": [/b] After more than a decade in Early Access, the game still feels unpolished in many areas, while basic, long-promised features like bandits or robust NPC systems remain missing (though competently implemented by the modding community). The recent 1.0/2.0 updates have only amplified these frustrations, adding poorly implemented features like the annoying storm system that just waste time.
	
     I got my money's worth, absolutely. But I cannot recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state, nor can I endorse the development philosophy. If you are looking for a stable, long-term survival experience that consistently builds on its foundations, this isn't it. The game is a revolving door of concepts, and you never know when the mechanics you enjoy will be completely removed in the next patch. The modding community truly keeps this game alive; without them, it would have died a long time ago.",False,0,0,1764096211

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198045346476,"As a avid TCG player who has been heavily invested in the game since 2005, I have to say this is nearly unplayable.

While naturally it shares every issue with normal gameplay of the real card game, it also goes much deeper then that. First point: The gatcha system (while theres certainly FAR worse ones out there) is terrible. Grinding gems takes forever and once you've cleared solo mode, say goodbye to ever getting anything new ever again, because the game will VERY slowly drip feed you a paultry sum of gems IF YOU WIN a ranked match and thats about it (GOOD LUCK winning without a tier 0 deck)

Second point: Cheaters. The game is FULL of them. Everything you can imagine. FTK bots, AFK bots, players who can see your hand at all times, people who manipulate the cards drawn on both sides, deck stacking, its awful and nearly unplayable.

Third point: The TERRIBLE and WILDLY inconsistent banlist. So...you're telling me that the current tier 0 (which has been tier 0 for nearly 3 months now) doesn't have a single card even so much as semi-limited, but secret village, card of demise, POT OF PROSPERITY are banned? Maxx C is at 2. Pot of duality is at 1. What.

Fourth point: It is VERY begginer hostile. The game just expects you to casually pay over 100 REAL LIFE dollars to MAYBE get a CHANCE at getting specific cards that are essential and you litterally CAN NOT win even in rookie without. 

Fifth point: Bugs. And lots of them. I get this is the most complex card game of all time so naturally, when in digital form, its not gurenteed to work properly every time, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Were getting nonsense like a card that does NOT have to be face-up to resolve somehow fizzeling after being MST'd, cards whos activation requirement is something like ""Target 1 card you control"" and somehow not being allowed to activate it despite the fact there is NOTHING preventing targeting anywhere, special summoning from the grave with necrovalley on the field, ect ect. FIX YOUR GAME KONAMI

sixth point: The horrible meta: I get this is an issue in the TCG and OCG as well, but due to the wonky and weird banlist, i think its at its worst here. You better REALLY enjoy seeing the same 3 decks, because once you get past bronze its ALLLLL youre ever going to see for the rest of your life.

Seventh point: While this is not 100% proven yet, there is evidence to suggest the game is bias for asian players. Letting asian players start every duel with 3 different handtraps plus 2 different 1 card starters every single game whilst giving the english players 3 same named HOPT cards and 2 extenders that can't play through 3 hand traps. Or for the first time in 20 duels you open maxx c but AWWW DIDNT MATTER because the asian player opened ash, 2 starters, and extender, TTT, and maxx c themselves. It happens SO often and is almost always exlusively from asian players, that I am convinced the game plays favorites.

eighth point: The community is ULTRA toxic. No one is helpful, everyone is hostile, and everyone thinks theyre king of games while everyone else is worthless peasents. Any time you complain about ANYTHING its always ""skill issue"" (despite 50% of the game being luck) No, its not ""skill issue"" that konami themselves wanted the opponent to win and gave them 4 hand traps and a starter whilst not giving me and handtraps or breakers, thats RNG, not skill.


Overall, I simply can NOT recommend this horrible game to anyone who values their life or sanity. If you enjoy being screwed over by RNG while everyone who you simply ask for help or tips from mock you, go ahead, but no thanks. Im good.",False,1,0,1764173621

From the start of the game to the credit roll, Nier is a pleasant and melancholic game that pours a lot of attention into its side quests to paint a picture of life in a dying world.  It's a game as much about loving the NPCs struggling day after day as it is about its character-driven main story.

However, you may be aware that Nier is a game with multiple endings.  Rather than a choice of parallel endings that you see in many RPGs, this game follows from Drakengard and VNs in having sequential endings that build upon each other.  Or at least, they try to.

The positive part of my review ends at the credit roll for Ending A.  (Or a little after—the backstory you get for Kainé just after is also easily worthwhile.)  To reach the other endings, you have to repeat sections of the game again and again and again.  The actual new content is minimal—just a few extra cutscenes stretched thin across old bones.  What new content there is is rarely interesting, instead repeating or expanding emotional points that were already present in the original playthrough and could've been included the first time around.  The personality flaws of the main cast go unexplored, and the extra characterisation for your enemies changes the story from a tragedy into a tone-deaf farce.  Meanwhile, what emotional impact the story originally had is scrubbed off as you sit through the same scenes again and again, waiting for it to be over.

It should also be noted that combat itself is very shallow, and really doesn't stand up to replay.  By my final run of the ending boss gauntlet, I had figured out several points [i]during combat[/i] where I was free to scroll on my phone while button mashing or evading one-handed, barely glancing at the game screen.

There is at least some actual novel material when you get to the final ending, and it's quite sweet... but it's only enough to remind you that the first half of the game was actually good, and not enough to justify the crime against art that is the second half of the game.",False,16,0,1763214987

Graphics that haven't been updated or even made for pc YEP.  Awful ""power up"" (word edit) system yep. Things that are left unexplained and just don't make sense YEP.

Another Awful thing about this game is there are things that take up a ridiculous amount of time and that are very unnecessary and annoying. There are parts where it MAKES YOU WALK and not just lil parts, When you're searching for EMIL you have to walk the entire time through the mansion at a snails pace and it really really makes it agonizing.. same with the light house, same with the boat, its weird and very very aggravating. One other horrible thing is basically there is NO FAST TRAVEL you spend hours running back and fourth between the same 4 places eventually they give you a guy on a boat that can take you places but hes always so far outta the way and not easy to get to that you might as well just run because you're gonna get there in the same amount a time give or take a few seconds.

This game was so lazy that instead of making a village they made a small room with trees in it with 4 npcs that were ""townspeople"".. Instead of it being a new area with a new boss.. its a ""dream forest"" where the mayor talks to you in text as if you were part of their dream and you fall victim to a ""death dream""
disease. The game then reads you PAGES of text and if you don't answer the changing text correct;y you have to start over and that my friends is one of the bosses/stages. Its most def one of the laziest things ive ever seen.

The games story isn't so bad it really isn't but if you're looking for a game like NeiR:Automata you're going to be extremely disappointed. I played through every single ending hoping something fun was gonna happen... instead i played the same exact thing 4 times out of 5 with the 5th being the weakest ending... ever.

While I liked the game and had fun playing it, there were plenty of times  when it felt more of a slog to get through. The world is semi open-world that is both good and bad. Constant Saving felt like a must

Starting off, making my characters was fun, there were a good amount of classes to choose from. Playing around with some starting skill options, personal customization was ok nothing too crazy for the Two Player Characters you create as my heroes.
A few voices to choose from, personalities etc. Not everything in the game is voiced, most MC dialogue gets voiced with their little side quips, side characters here and there, most dialogue will be read. A few companions to choose from, I choose two and rocked with them, since I believe if you swap them in later their level's won't match yours, needs more testing?

Combat was fun and not fun, while it worked and gave me chances to be creative with combining the environment, items I have, spells and such to fight, it meant the enemy could do the same. With the world being open-ish often I'd find myself in fights I wasn't going to win, the battles can drag on since the AI sometime is fast, othertimes It's like Internet Explorer making a turn. Getting wiped just to fight the same long tedious fight drags on, trying multiple strats just to get perma stunned by 5+ enemies. The wide variety of spells and weapon types means you have to adjust based on the enemy, with some damage types healing them, (my best weapons healed the final boss, that was fun).

Locales/Vibes- locations looked great, it felt like an adventure, from simple beaches (how original lol) to ancient caves and tombs to spirit realms & even to the ends of time. In the same vein some locations were terrible, like the Luculla Sandstorm,  nothing was fun about making a conga line with my party to pull the enemy, spending 20 minutes to beat a enemy then running away to escape combat and teleport away just to rinse and repeat. 
There are traps and secrets hidden in the world, things like hidden grave to lava traps.

Puzzles, some felt fun and rewarding, while the majority were just annoying and killed the pace and fun of the game, You'll need to be used to separating your party and multi-tasking with them, along with reading everything ever. Or needing very ""specific"" weights needed on weight plates. Many of them feel like they're trying to be overly clever and are doing too much imo. 

This is the kind of game where you need to interact and talk with everyone and everything, which takes forever. Even then you'll still miss things and interactions. If only I realized my choices in events that gave my character points in their personality things like ""vindictive, pragmatic, romantic"" etc actually affected my character stats and potential dialogue options that could lock you out of things. Along with knowing what items can actually be dragged onto others to work.

To me, this game would make one do new runs over and over to fix their mistakes if they get softlocked. So yeah you could respec everything except personality points from dialog and benefits/detriments, but what if you lose your skills? So what if i can buy them again or craft them again except the skills for my Knight and ranger? Ones that can't be gotten again? I committed to my build and mistake and suffered for it. Some skills felt useless and were a waste of precious talent points. My rogue had near max stealth skill, and I was still getting discovered, so I just used his ""Make Invisible"" skill which actually worked and was 1000x better.

Quick Side note, Don't sell Tenebrium items to merchants, I then had to deal with dying merchants for the rest of the game, I kept alive with my mage spamming Rejuvenates.

An annoyance to me was near the end game, I couldn't progress past a door needing me to have Blood stone/Star Stones, story/lore items that also double as ""full party heals"" basically omega tier heals. It said I didn't have enough but I already went everywhere I could ingame. So there I was backtracking the whole game searching high and low for these supposed stones. I found one, the only last one, but he still wouldn't open. How was I supposed to know I needed to use my rare healing stones? Then after that go to my homebase to talk to some merchants for the door to then open saying I was then worthy.

While I did enjoy my time with this game, those moments were here and there bogged down by slow moments, overtuned encounters, overly annoying puzzles, slow combat and general shenanigans one would expect from this style of game. Again I say to better enjoy the game, it'd take multiple runs/attempts. It'd be more fun for me now that I know how it plays out and how to spec better. I'd recommend it to people who like this type of game and difficulty, however to the casual RPG gamer who just wants to have easy fun without thinking, no stress kind of thing, this isn't for you.",False,0,1,1760780429

Feels like playing dnd with a dm that will happily wipe the whole party because he doesnt like that the characters did an ""evil"" action or refreshes the browser so the combat data is lost because you landed a crit on his cool new bad guy or spent too long minmaxxing HIS OWN GAME. IM GOING TO FINISH THIS GAME AS EVIL AS POSSIBLE NOW OUT OF SPITE.

The humor? Chef's kiss.
The characters? Absolute chaos goblins with personality.
The graphics? Weirdly gorgeous for a game that’s not exactly new anymore. Honestly, half the time I forgot this thing came out years ago, because everything looks like it has been polished by a team of very dedicated fantasy elves.

And the classes? Amazing. You can basically create anything from a teleporting rogue assassin who politely stabs people in the face… to a necromantic violinist who heals by bleeding on things. Truly art.

But then… Source Points happen.

Ah, yes. Source Points. The magical energy that fuels your strongest abilities, your coolest spells, is needed to acomplish dungeons/quests, and—apparently—your greatest frustration in life.

It’s not that the game limits you on them. That would actually be interesting, right? Making tough choices, thinking strategically, feeling the weight of your decisions?

Nope.
Divinity says: “You can refill them endlessly, dear player!”
And then quietly adds:
“…Just run back and forth like a lost chicken to do it.”

Why?
Why give me infinite refills… but only if I prove my dedication by jogging across Rivellon like I’m training for a marathon?
Why ruin the pacing of such a brilliant game with a mechanic that feels like an unpaid internship?

Instead of epic adventure, I get Source Point Fetch Quest Simulator 2017.

And that’s when my enthusiasm died a dramatic, theatrical death. Not by combat. Not by a boss. But by pure, uncut inconvenience. It’s like the game whispered:
""You like fun? Too bad. Go touch another puddle of ghost juice, peasant.""

So, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is still an incredible game with unforgettable humor, beautiful visuals, and rich gameplay.
But Source Points?
Yeah, no. Hard pass. When a mechanic makes me feel like I’m clocking in for my shift, I put down the controller and walk away.

Final Verdict:
A masterpiece held hostage by a mechanic that thinks I have the free time of a bored god. If Larian ever patches Source Points into something less annoying, I’m back in. Until then… Rivellon, it’s not you. It’s your weird energy system.",False,1,1,1763244560

Not to talk about the unnecesary change of gameplay feel in comparison with the first game. Here it just feels like enemies are carefully placed to interrupt you movement flow.

And the annoying meaningless side quests...

Here's the most frustrating characteristic of each point:
- platform usually requires high precision, i.e. if you don't jump exactly at the border of a platform, you won't grab it but instead will fall through it;
- exploration doesn't give you clues about where to go next so, every time you beat a boss and complete an area, you either look on the Internet or have to go forth and back in every single part of the map, until you find a new area you can access (and, of course, being a souls-like, this not only takes time but it's also annoying because enemies keep re-spawning);
- all enemies deal damage just by contact, and with punishihng hit-boxes (like, being close to a still enemy is equivalent to getting smashed by a hammer).
  This is not only another source of frustration both while doing platform and exploration/navigation, but also results in added frustration while fighting, in having to calculate not to end up too close to an enemy after an attack, and sometimes in not having a single safe point in the screen, when it's full of enemies.

You have missed the hype and most likely have already seen all of the spoilers. Either way, this game is better to watch anyway since the devs haven't updated the game since 2023 and that update was for the addition of MacOS players being able to play the game. I have a small feeling that the devs have abandoned this game which is sad since there are certain achievements that are now impossible to get due to certain areas having bugs where you simply either get soft-locked trying to enter them or can't enter them without somehow debugging if that is even possible (I'll get into those bugs later in this review). 

My personal opinion of this game is that it is amazing, it still seems to have an active community, it is cute as all hell and even funny at some parts, and the puzzles and story and interactions with the individual robots is just awesome. I love cats too :3

Anyway now, about the bugs: There is this weird bug in the game that affects three achievements. Those achievements being (from what I believe): Territory, Badges, and I Remember. The bug is where you just get stuck on certain parts of big pipes that you either walk on or through. I've had it to where it completely traps the character you play as forcing me to reload my save and I've had it to where it just blocks the character you play from progressing entirely.

Combat always feels like an uphill battle because it feels like no matter what strategy I try using, I'm doing something wrong and getting hit HARD by the enemies. This became tedious and annoying when exploring and going back the screen I was just on like 5 seconds ago just to find out that the enemies reapawned, and they're a pain to avoid! I've played so many JRPG type games but the combat system just wasn't clicking for me. 

I also just couldn't get into the humor or be bothered to care about the side characters. I dunno, maybe it's because I played Deltarune so much only a couple of months before this game and I intentionally and unfairly compare the 2 of them - of course this would seem dull in comparison to that game for me. 

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. The combat in concept is a really fun idea and the story seems interesting. Overall it was just too meh for me to want to continue. 

I would probably still recommend this game, but there's one really annoying flaw that I experienced while playing it that I can't forgive. The issue is simple yet big enough to have a negative impact on gameplay for multiple sections of the game - THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SO DANG DARK. I encountered a section where you're alone in a dark house, and I almost thought my system was frozen because I could barely see anything. This resulted in me fumbling around in the dark and extending that section of the game by like another half hour longer than it was supposed to take because I just couldn't see where to go. I tried everything I could think of involving messing with brightness, contrast, gamma, docking it to my TV, etc. It seems this is not an issue unique to me, because I found a couple of forums concerning the issue and none of their propsosed solutions worked. I guess this was the case for a couple of other people on the forums because they quit the game too since there are multiple dark sections of the game they didn't want to deal with lol. I just don't see how the devs haven't fixed something so glaringly obvious and annoying after all this time that the game has been released. I would've considered returning this and purchasing it on the Nintendo Switch but I already went over the 2 hour play time and couldn't return it so I didn't want to waste my money again 🙃

That's not what the game actually calls them, but it's what I'll call them. Each world has ""sequences"" to them. You cannot explore the entirety of the dream world before the real world, and vice versa. The first sequence of the dream world seemed decently engaging enough, where the rules that the game establishes for itself not being set in stone, and each interaction and fight feeling new and fresh. This maintains itself in the first sequence in the real world, where I was able to explore it and find all the connections between it and the dream world. And then after that...the rules have already been established, and the game doesn't particularly deviate from it, if at all. And those interesting parallels aren't really drawn anymore. So it's just a long, repetitive...well, I wouldn't say slog. But it isn't particularly enjoyable.
 Story wise...there is a twist that completely sours the story. A part of me doesn't want to reveal the twist, but then again, if you don't want to play a game again simply because you know the twist to it, what's the point of the game, really? In short, I can't sympathize with manslaughter. You, the character, have committed a criminal act. If not involuntary manslaughter, then staging it to look like a suicide certain doesn't help things, either. And THEN the main character and the character who helped you stage the body feel bad about it? They feel bad about losing a friend? Would it have killed them to, I don't know, call for help? Instead of staging it to look like a suicide? That's what a friend would do! Get their friend help! Now, I haven't actually reached the end. I've just seen enough spoilers through the community of this game to have found that out. And that twist just completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. Getting so attached to some characters in a movie, show, or video game just for it to not resolve in a fulfilling way...you know, closure...that's one of the greatest sins a piece of media can commit.

-90% sure the creator OMOCAT is a pedo.... Review would have been positive but I don't want to support them so here we are. (Don't take this as s serious allegation, instead research the MULTIPLE dramas surrounding the creator yourself...)
-This may fall under me disliking RPGs, but I really wish there was no/a higher limit on the number of saves you can have at once.
-Interacting with stuff is weird. Sometimes you need to press and hold, and sometimes it wont let you close out after a single tap. I would look at the bathroom mirror for 0.1 second (because you need to press and hold) and then be forced to look at that one photo in the bookshelf (not exactly a fan of that or that one unskippable boss's design btw [boohoo], but this last bit is an opinion also)

Overall, good game, would recommend, but maybe hesitate before supporting the creator",False,3,2,1759822359

Honestly this game is dying and it's killing me to admit it :

- Queing/Matchmaking will play with your nerves because of dodging and server errors. Today again I queued for 15 minutes to get a RM. 
- Servers and Codebase are pure trash, and I'm not even exagerating. Constants drops, players crashing (and stop saying it's because of potatoes PC, High end Configs crashes too). 
- You can't get back in a game after a crash, so it's instant GG. 
- Players crash is happening all the time. Looking at my history on insights, there's about 1 on 2 games that last between 1 and 5 minutes because of players dropping out of the game.

If you've already played Steins;Gate and you are looking for something that has some of the same types of themes, I guess this game kind of does... But be prepared to lower your expectations. A lot.

This game had a lot of potential and I was pretty intrigued after playing through the first episode... But then once I started playing the DLC episodes I realised pretty quickly that even though it constantly tells you ""your choices will influence the past, present, and future, choose wisely"", none of your choices actually have any real impact on the story. Whenever you encounter a choice that seems like it should have a significant impact, you can pretty much bet that whatever character is affected by the choice has already completed their role in the story by that point and won't really be mentioned much for the rest of the story (regardless of which option you picked).

One thing I did like about the game is the rewind mechanic. It is implemented really well, and there are quite a few good puzzles that make use of it. Unfortunately, this leads me into my next complaint, which is the abundance of bugs in the game that range from slightly inconvenient to pretty infuriating.

One of the most annoying bugs in this game is that the camera constantly locks up. I think it has something to do with ""examining"" something and then immediately trying to move the camera after closing the examine screen. It will lock your camera in a specific direction and make it impossible to look around for a while, and then after you walk around for long enough the camera will eventually fix itself (usually). And then there are a couple of sections where you can get locked in the rewind screen without any way of escape and you have to restart the section and go through everything again. Also something is glitched with the textures, it seems like the characters sometimes have multiple layers and one of the layers sometimes halfway glitches and they get super pale or something. Fortunately that one is pretty easy to ignore because the graphics are already bad enough that you don't really notice. Not that bad graphics really detracts from the overall experience, which is obviously a lot more narrative-driven than something that's meant to blow you away with visual fidelity.

Then there's the plot. The time travel stuff is pretty interesting and there are some genuinely clever ethical dilemmas that arise from it, but the setting really wasn't for me. Most of the characters are annoying (which makes sense I guess because they're all teenagers at a private school) and there's a lot of swearing for no good reason. And the main conflict is just weird, and doesn't seem realistic at all. Also, I grew up in Oregon and THERE AREN'T ANY FIREFLIES. I guess that's a nitpick, but that immediately broke what little immersion there was for me, lol

Anyway, I wouldn't recommend paying $20 for the DLC even if you played the first episode and enjoyed it. Your money is much better spent on something like Steins;Gate.",False,1,1,1762556626

Despite how good Dragon Age Origins was, no amount of nice lore and storyline helps me tolerate the obsessive amount of grinding in this game that does not know if it wants to provide a good single-player experience or to be an MMORPG with offline servers.

Dragon Age Inquisition is the product of a new design philosophy that spits on the memory of Dragon Age Origins by diverting the player from its previous narrative-driven and consequence-driven logic to an open-world design with vestigial elements from a logic of microtransactions in pay to win games.

Of course there are no microtransactions in Dragon Age Origins, but we all know that blocking quests behind real wait times (like in the war room) are only used by game developers to force players into paying to unlock these sections of the game faster. By blocking quests merely for the sake of it under hours or days, the developers brought a vestige from the microtransaction systems of P2W games, and this is not the only instance where Dragon Age Inquisition is more akin to an MMORPG than to a good single-player RPG.

But what is so wrong with this new design philosophy that Bioware has adapted? That it breaks the narrative of what Dragon Age is.
Dragon Age Inquisition is the story of a person who seems to have been touched by divine power, surviving an explosion with a mark that provides the key to bring the world back into order from beaches that allow demons to cross from the fade to Thedas. It is the story of a person who becomes the public face of an organization tasked with saving the world. It is a story of urgency, the breaches won't wait for the main character to have a field trip before they come to save the world.

Yet, the game design gets everything wrong:
1. Despite the narrative emphasis that Dragon Age has always exhibited, every actual plot moment seems to be blocked by hours of constant grinding and filler material.
2. Every combat has lost all its meaning and it's now nothing but filler. Every enemy is an HP piñata ready to waste your time even in the easiest difficulties. And not even in the sense of being difficult, just in the sense of being unnecessarily long.
3. The open-world zones destroy all sense of urgency and of pacing, letting the player roam to the most irrelevant places.
4. Most of the side quests are filler content that lack any connection to the player's status as the Herald of Andraste or even any relevance to their mission. Yeah, you can make people be more favorable to the Inquisition by helping them do menial things, but that is not the job for the person who is in charge of closing the breaches. The open-world design forces the player character into an errand-runner, but they are not an errand-runner. They are the Herald of Andraste!

Thus, all these are symptoms of a game design philosophy that does not suit the narrative of a Herald touched by almost divine power. The open world logic forces a dissonance where, despite the urgency of the situation and the role the main character plays in the great scheme of things, the player is invited to waste its time doing everything but the engaging with the main plot. Its vast open-world zones interrupts the pacing and drama, its excessive amount of filler combat distracts from the actual point of the story and its new system of side quests excessively reliant on letters (instead of actual interesting interactions with real people) does not add to the real plot. We've gone from a story-driven game to an open world with the vestiges of microtransaction logic bringing about a degree of dissonance that just destroys the entire experience. Going to a new place like Val Royeaux does not feel anymore like advancing the plot, but like just opening a new can of worms with more irrelevant chores to complete. This game may be great for grinders and completionists, but it does not feel at all like a continuation of Dragon Age Origins.

But this, is not that. This is just one tragedy right after another, almost all caused by a certain apparently incredibly racist demographic. That's the message, a certain demographic is evil and racist and this game attempts to show you first hand just how treacherous and cruel the world is for anyone outside of that demographic. So if you love  political messages being shoved down your throat, this is the game for you.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of the dialogue is unskippable, none of the characters are likable, all just victims of the racist and religious evil doers with their own uninteresting stories of how they're also victims. This results in being forced to sit through literally hours of boring dialogue from people you just do not care about in the slightest.

An abundance of idiotic one-hit-kill mechanics coupled with limitations to saving that lead to having to do boring shit over and over again (a couple of the fights are really unreasonable to boot), the lack of any (!) character development, the worst/most uninteresting loot/equipment system I've ever seen (and with the spectre weapons you can get before the halfway point being the best in the game, all further weapon looting is pointless – and so are the millions of accumulating credits you can't spend on anything because there is nothing worth buying! this isn't even amateur level game design, it's retard level!), boring-as-fuck levelling which is completely unbalanced as well, psionic abilities all seem to do the same thing (namely, hindering your opponent for a few seconds – I can't tell a difference between them at all!), the abominable balance of main and side quests (speedrunners must love this though...), unskippable cutscenes, many, many bugs... and, most direly, the total and utter failure in the RPG aspect as you cannot choose even your own words (!), much less anything else between generally good and vaguely evil... and it's beyond reason itself, as predecessor Knights of the Old Republic was infinitely better in each and every single regard, and DA:O which came afterwards in almost all regards!

EDIT: Game 2. Oh boy! There is more character development in the first 30 min than in game 1, but the actual gameplay is so much worse I simply cannot believe it! Only 4 to 6 things to level instead of some 15 (!), you can't specialise in weapons, the actual shooting feels way worse, the first (!) group battle is already next to unwinnable (and I did beat game 1 on hardest difficulty...), health refills are gone apparently (or I cannot find them) and to top things off, I cannot figure out how to fucking map the quickslots (which I never used in the first game, as I was able to map the weapons to keys, WHICH SHOULD ALSO BE THE CASE HERE!). Fucking shit, the sniper scope doesn't even line up with your line of sight, LOLOOLOL.

I cannot believe how hard they fucked up the gameplay compared to the already not very good first game! No inventory at all, four or five skills to level, no specialisation in weapons, still no feedback whatsoever – you are literally not told whether you hit an enemy or not, and what hits you in turn (even though the latter isn't as important as you can't protect yourself against different kinds of damage, OBVIOUSLY)! No way to boost your abilities in something like the insane garage fight (complete with the biggest video game sin that exists, infinitely respawning enemies – and that's against very limited ammo!!! Hell, after this shit I'll never complain about a game having infinite ammo again!), hell, the fuckers even took out health potions altogether!!! There's apparently quickslots but no apparent way to map them, so I have to change my weapon FROM THE FUCKING MENU EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Oh and making the sprint key not only the same as Use but also Cover in this one means I will never buy another game from this developer again.

I regret spending 4,79 on this fucking shit of a game, I really do. They did not test this game before releasing it, and they did not test the re-release either... what kind of people would do that... only the worst scum imaginable. Humanity doesn't DESERVE to be saved!",False,0,2,1763510572

After pushing through several hours, I’ve had enough. SOMA pretends to be this deep, atmospheric horror masterpiece, but in reality, it’s a painfully slow walking simulator with frustrating underwater segments. I’ve played my fair share of complex, puzzle-heavy survival horror games, and this one isn’t challenging, it’s just poorly executed and painfully repetitive gameplay.

The first hour hooked me with its atmosphere and story potential, but once you’re thrown underwater, the experience falls apart. Low visibility, sluggish movement, and maze-like areas where you wander aimlessly for hours with no sense of direction; not fun, not scary, just exhausting.

It’s a shame, because there’s clearly a good story buried somewhere under all this frustration. But good narrative design doesn’t excuse bad gameplay. I’ve played walking sims before, this one just happens to be the most boring one pretending to be more than it is.

That's the question the game poses. A journey on philosophical existentialism, if you will. If you've never entertained this topic, it's not implausible the game may have a deep impact on you.

Story is essential for me, gameplay is secondary, always. And a game like this is *entirely* story driven; there's no gameplay here other than walking and interacting with the environment via terminals, pushing buttons, opening doors, etc. I should be right in my element yet I found myself bored to tears. I believe with just a few gameplay mechanics, like an inventory, some resource management, semi-engaging puzzles and a combat system, the game would actually be enjoyable.

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198052380519,"This is one of those games where the first 20 hours or so are very addicting as you learn to swim in an ocean of content and struggle with balancing your economy with logistics and raids; but once you understand how to swim in the ocean, the mechanics all feel really flat and repetitive. Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.

The good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.

Visually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.

My gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.

The combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.

As many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.

Overall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",False,2,0,1764008930

Starting a next run you're gonna be doing the same limited set of actions you can do to build your city. I have exhausted all variation quite shortly. I feel claustrophobic and lonely, it feels like im playing an empty husk of a world. Let me explain several independent thoughts I have which I'm conflicted about. These are only a few examples to explain a small portion of my feels.

Several mechanics and rules just live in the wild online as myths and mysticisms: what for, and how to use the wagon shop for example. Of course that's not the only one, as there are several other ones that are just not declared by the game so you kinda have to guess and hope it works like you want. Reading reddit comments and forum posts of other people's thoughts on what they believe the mechanic works like. There are several annoyances in the game that keep piling up at the back of your mind as you build your city and you get to know the systems of the game. Some examples:

The upgrade and proximity system encourages you to just cramp things together and make grids. It often comes down to ""do you want a pretty town, or do you want to survive?""
We want a pretty town of course, thats the game's appeal. But in the back of your mind this annoyance is always going to be there.

It's great that you can set a max limit for resources, so that villagers can quit that job and enter an other one. But this isn't true for all jobs: farmers, healers, soldiers are assigned to their duties and are still busy standing in their job title. There is no downside to unassigning them while they are not useful. You can also just let them be, which is what I do: but it's still going to be an annoyance in the back of your mind.

The reason for my dislike isn't concretely these 2-3 examples. It's the overall feel, for which I have provided these examples. This feel, while the game is in early access is fine, but not as a full release at full price: Which is how I encountered this game the first time. I gave it enough playtime for me to doubt myself, because I did have doubts, maybe I just didn't understand the vision or the game.

The gameplay itself is based around a simple four lane trading card game that gets a little thin after a while. Aside from a few mechanics it's pretty straightforward. They seem really proud of this gameplay because you are playing it constantly.

There are puzzles but they range from so easy I don't know why this should be a bar to progress to wow I actually had to look around for the solution to this one. 

The story is basically just a creepypasta/SCP. It's digestible enough but a lot of the elements (the number and types of scrybes for instance) seem arbitrary. I don't really know why this story needed to be told. It doesn't seem to come from a place of burning inspiration. The ending is incredibly abrupt and stupid. Expect a lot of fourth wall breaks and acknowledgement of ludological dissonance. Kudos for risking it by making live action segments tho more games should do that.

I guess I don't get what I was supposed to take from this. There are some really sick boss fights with some great designs. The vibe for the front half of the game is pretty great it just kind of degenerates.

Tutorial is only 3 hours long, but it's a blast.  So there's that.  The problem is that's not enough to justify the price tag, even on sale.  There's no way to play ""non-tutorial"" mode on a reasonable difficulty.  I don't even mind losing to ""hard"" fights that ""IF"" I had the right cards/items I could win.  It's the ""Utterly impossible no matter what cards/items"" fights that are a turn off.
After the tutorial is an *entirely* different game with the worst 2D graphics I've ever seen.  It's *NOT* the same game.  It's a total bait and switch.  And Kaycee's mod doesn't make up for the ultra short ""fun"" part.",False,0,1,1762473698

I understand that as a rouge like game there is a certain randomness to the cards you get. And I really enjoy rougelike putting hundreds of hours into the Binding of Isaac and nearly 100% the game. But I feel the randomness is a detriment, some card combos create incredible gameplay loops with a good deck build, and as someone who plays many deck builders enjoy, I really feel this game would fit better as a build a deck and play through. More so if you had different starting decks that fit certain playstyles of the character and then went to deck building. I really cuts my motivation when I get a really solid playstyle that I really like but will never get to experience again. I think because of the card and turn based system it feels much worse than getting a bad or silly build in other realtime rougelike games.
An additional gripe I have which could be a skill issue, that this game really feels like you have to replay the game to complete it, in Issac when you start the game you don't just beat the whole game but there are small victories at first and it rewards skillful play, with slay the spire I feel like I just need to throw a run in order to somewhat progress enough to get to a further tier of the game.

It used to be a very fun and balanced game but with every update it keeps getting worse and worse. Some of the new boards are awful to say the least. In the last level most of them seem to be designed to kill your run without any possibility of you doing anything about it (You put a 2k health enemy along with 2 600 health ones in a board where ALL the peballs are constantly vanishing, wtf is this). 

In the last cruciballs (I'm stuck at cruciball 19 thanks to the awful updates) everything is RNG based due to only two relic builds and two or three balls being viable to have an attempt at completing the run (if you don't rng into a poorly designed board that kills it without even a chance to luck or save scum through it). It gets so bad that it is impossible to play higher cruciballs without save scumming and restarting a billion times because you won't do anything unless you roll one specific item from the start (which I won't mention cause it will get removed otherwise like they did with some fun orbs and strategies).

I would have liked a choice for navigation where I could just pick the route I want to go rather than having to shoot a ball and hope I get to go the right way. At least a choice where If I pick the path I don't get any extra money or healing provided by the relics and orbs. The encounters with the Wall (second stage boss) which even if you played perfectly up till that point is too big of a hurdle as about I lose about 80 percent of the time. I find many play styles would just fail outright at it. The other encounter with the long line of exploding goblins always ends my run. Doesn't seem to matter what orbs or relics I have they win. They do 40 damage a hit and have more health combined that most bosses. I'm at the point where I just close the game and start over at this encounter.  With these issues which pop up way to often I just cant' recommend it.,False,5,0,1759247394

Music was fine, one or two songs were memorable, the rest are what is best described as ""serviceable."" I also thought the aesthetics of the game were really dumb, which didn't help my impression of it.

The gameplay can give you this sense that you're doing something at first, but after a while you realize that your creatures and spells rarely synergize in any interesting way. Too much focus was put on the board, maybe. What's left is a game that feels half-deckbuilder, half-tower defense, and isn't very good at either.

Compared to other better roguelike deckbuilders this is by far inferior to some of the top names in this category like Slay the Spire or Across the Obelisk.

The secondary clan option is a cool idea on paper but most combinations just don't work together meaningfully enough to be preferable to sticking strictly to your main clan.

Anyone comparing this to Slay the Spire is like comparing Halo to Skyrim, oh but aren't they both first person fantasy games where you kill enemies? This game is NOTHING like Slay the Spire except you have cards and you start with 3 mana/energy each turn. That's it.

Damage is the ONLY thing that matters in this game. Sure, the different mechanics can have great use against all the normal enemies, but when it comes to bosses pure damage is the only way to win. And you know what works just as good as all that strategy you used against regular enemies? PURE DAMAGE!

Look, I wanted to like this game as I feel MTG has lost its mind in recent set designs and you have to be rich just to have a *decent* deck. I saw reviews about how awesome this game is and thought hey I could sink my teeth into some nice deck building content right now. But there is no strategy that is going to prepare you for a boss fight that has 1300 HP when most enemies have around 5 to 50 HP and oh you can't play any spells once the boss round starts, so no strategy there, you just have to hope your monsters can somehow deal 20 to 30 times the amount of damage they did when you were taking care of the normal enemies. Oh, and all enemies move first so your monsters will be nice and weakened before the boss starts fighting. I had hope for this game when I had bosses around 300 HP, seemed fair with multiple strategies to make use of, but when you need 4 times the time/damage to kill the boss and your cards aren't 4 times stronger AND you can't even play any healing or damage spells once they start fighting the boss it really just makes all your other cards worthless! Oh, thank you SO much for these 1 mana 2 damage cards! And don't forget about these amazing healing cards to heal ANY single monster for a whole 3 HP all for only 1 mana! They will help SO FUCKING MUCH AGAINST 1300 HP bosses!  Oh and you start with 5 copies each of these worthless cards! Two entire hands that just won't do anything meaningful. Sure, you can upgrade your cards but what is 25HP on my monster going to do against a boss that hits for 18 damage? Oh sure 1 maybe two extra rounds to deal my 30 - 50 damage against a 1300 HP boss, awesome now they have 1200 HP and now they are on the second floor which is already full of monsters I've put there in previous turns so any extra monster cards are deadweight in your hand, but don't worry you get 1 turn to play these junk spell cards that you didn't have time to get rid of or enough money to upgrade and make ""useful"" (but seriously what is 12 damage gonna do vs 2 damage when, again, there is 1300 HP to get rid of)

I'm going to try this game again sometime after I forget how bad it was. I know I only played one run, but honestly I don't care what else this game has to offer. Apparantly the devs have changed cards multiple time because they know how worthless they were and yet they still keep these worthless starter cards that aren't even useful after the first 2 battles! Slay the Spire was different. I wanted to get farther in the game. I wanted to unlock more stuff. I wanted to try different strategies because they all had depth in that game. Challenging but still fair. Hell, even the starter cards had use in the late game, they were never truly worthless. My suggestion is just don't waste your time with this shallow mobile game garbage.

Oh, and I thought this would be good for steam deck but the battery life is TERRIBLE. I get 7+ hours playing Slay the Spire 90fps and after 2 hours of this garbage game I'm down by 60% battery life! But hey, what do you need optimizations for when mobile devices rival desktop machines from just a few years ago? Just power thru all that terrible code like you have to power thru this terrible game!

The gameplay loop is simple, you have a starter deck with spells and monster cards that you can incrementally improve between rounds of combat.

I really wanted to love Celeste. Everyone raves about it... the touching story about mental health, the beautiful pixel art, the soundtrack that's supposedly transcendent. I can see why people connect with Madeline's journey. The anxiety metaphors are thoughtful, the presentation is polished, and there's clearly a lot of heart poured into this game. But no amount of narrative depth can make me enjoy dying 47 times on the same screen because I mistimed a dash by 0.2 seconds.

Precision platformers demand a very specific kind of patience and muscle memory that I simply don't find enjoyable. Every death in Celeste is supposedly a ""lesson,"" and yes, the respawns are lightning-fast, but that doesn't change the fundamental loop: attempt, fail, repeat ad nauseam until your fingers finally cooperate with your brain. It's not that the game is unfair - the controls are tight, the mechanics are clear - it's that this style of gameplay brings out the worst in me. The mounting frustration. The clenched jaw. The ""just one more try"" that turns into an hour of my life I'll never get back.

The game keeps telling me to ""just breathe"" while simultaneously designing situations that make me want to throw my controller through a window. There's something almost patronizing about a game that says ""you can do this!"" while putting strawberries just out of reach, taunting you with collectibles that require frame-perfect execution.

I understand why Celeste resonates with so many people. The metaphor of climbing a mountain as overcoming your inner demons is powerful. But sometimes a mountain is just a mountain, and sometimes I just want to enjoy a game without feeling like I'm studying for a reflex exam.

I tried my best to give it as much space as possible to develop a narrative and tell a compelling story without comparing it to anything. 

The concept and scenario is neat, and it could have been developed much deeper. Instead, it's sadly a drag of a walking simulator where NPCs feel like they have two lines of meaningful dialogue at most before being reduced to pixelated parrots.

The characters do not feel very compelling to me. Most of them feel one-dimensional, serving one purpose and then immediately becoming useless. Niko is alright, but I cannot justify the amount of love they get from the fanbase. May update this if the endings feel more compelling, but as of now it just feels way too forced and even a bit annoying. 

The puzzles were a letdown. The 'meta puzzles' that used the meta narrative of the world being a simulation were maybe a bit easy but also technically fun or unexpected. I didn't enjoy being jeered at by the computer when a file failed to initialize until a restart or when the background puzzle just straight up didn't function. (had to look that one up) The in-world puzzles like crafting or showing items to NPCs was time consuming, and a lot of item interactions you'd expect to give some kind of dialogue just end up doing nothing. 

Small gripes:
- Water pill felt really dumb. 
- Not being able to backtrack sections is annoying but an acceptable design decision. I guess it just makes you play again if you want achievements and don't already know what to do in the next section before you even see it. 
- PLEASE let me skip repeat dialogue.

Some more OneShot rage bait: When I bought OneShot I thought I was going to get the next Undertale, but instead I got the diet off-brand coke version of Undertale with a ""messing with your computer"" gimmick that locks from being able to play the game on Linux. 

But in all seriousness, although the game was interesting, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe my bar was too high, but the puzzles were awful, the music was mid, the characters felt two-dimensional (but are cute which is probably why people obsess over them), and the story was okay, I mean I didn't dislike the story but I also forgot most of it so that might just be me. This could very well be the result of overly high expectations, since I was expecting something with great music, a great story etc. but it really just felt superficial if that makes sense?

I mean it was among the highest rated games on Steam, so I was expecting to be blown away. What I got was a completely fine and serviceable game, but nowhere near phenomenal like I thought it would be. The characters in this world feels so shallow and one dimensional, and even Niko the protagonist isn't all that interesting. Supposedly it should make me feel emotional, but how could I when I couldn't form any real connection to any of the characters? The plot is predictable and just breaks its rules whenever it wants. [spoiler]The Entity spent the entire game convinced (rightfully so) that it's just a piece of code and cannot grow beyond its own programming, that the entire world is just a simulation generated each time I boot up the game. Then at the true ending, it suddenly becomes convinced that no actually, it might have free will after all because this true ending session is some path that was not in the original code. But then I, as the player, know that at the end of the day, this is still code and 0 and 1 and is just another game session like any previous game session. So does the game want to be meta or not?[/spoiler]

My biggest gripe yet though, is the size of the map of the game. The map a lot of the time is just a giant repetitive pattern with a few interactable NPCs scattered here and there, and they all say the same things just worded a bit differently. Some areas are connected by long walkways with, again, nothing to look at. Just cut out those walkway altogether and have them be connected directly, please, or have the walkway shorter, I dunno.

that being said, i don't think that invalidates my opinion. i've spent enough time on this game to know if its worth any more or not. i also want to say that i didn't get mad playing this game! i just genuinely have problems with how the game actually plays out, not issues with my own skill (?). i am only judging the game by the base content.

[h1] why do i not like this game? [/h1]

i typically enjoy games like this. i enjoyed beating getting over it, peaks of yore was a lot of fun (until the final mountain), and i have over 2000 hours tracked on geometry dash, i've spent easily hundreds of hours aim-training. i enjoy the struggle of improving at games.

so why's this one different for me?

well, i think that it (mainly) comes down to one big difference separating this game from all of the others: you can't react to your gameplay. what do i mean by that?

well, all of the games i mentioned (except jump king) all have the ability to react to your gameplay; you are in complete control. 
[list]
[*] your crosshair misses the target (aim training)? micro-adjust onto the head before shooting.
[*] you mistimed your jump off of a rock (peaks of yore)? you could use crampons to break your falling momentum and grab back onto something to fix your mistake.
[*] even in getting over it--you could make a mistake, but if you know what you're doing, you could find something to latch your hammer onto instead of watching your progress crash and burn in front of your eyes.
[*] geometry dash, for the most part, has pretty one-dimensional gameplay, but it has something great that makes it actually enjoyable! visual indication of when to click--it allows you to not rely [b] solely [/b] on muscle memory, and instead, look at the screen. even then, when flying with the ship gamemode, if you can tell that you're lower than you should be, you could hold click for a split-second longer to course-correct. being able to set checkpoints is also amazing; it makes games feel so much more fair.
[/list]
in jump king, if you fuck up, you can't save yourself. it's awfully punishing for a game that has NO indication of how far/high you're actually jumping. that essentially means that i didn't find jump king skillful.

when i was playing, i found that, yes, jumps got easier after a few falls, but my consistency with them would eventually plateau. why? well, because it's entirely muscle memory. obviously, for new jumps, you don't use muscle memory, but for any others, you could not be focused on the game, and be just as likely to clear a difficult jump as if you were focused.

i (also) found the game mind-numbingly boring to play. because the game doesn't actually require any focus, it doesn't use any of my attention. for probably about 3 of my 4.3 hours, i was listening to music; i could be completely unfocused on the game and be just as consistent as if i paused my music to focus more.

all you do in jump king is memorise positions to jump from and let your muscle memory work on how long to hold the spacebar down for. then, you hope that your brain was feeling generous enough that you jumped the right amount.

yes, i'm sure that this game gets more consistent, people wouldn't play it if it didn't. but, at the same time, i don't care! the game isn't fun to play, and the idea of sitting through just one more hour of this game makes me dread existing entirely. this game, essentially, feels less about mastery, and more about mindlessly playing until things click--i get that these two typically go hand-in-hand, but, to me, 'mastery' feels more like working hard and dedicating yourself to something, when jump king is more like a slog of sitting at your desk and staring at a screen until your eyes gloss over.

that being said, there's no way to improve the game without compromising the actual difficulty of it (if there is any real challenge). a visual indication, like a jump strength bar, would be amazing, and make the game FAR more consistent and enjoyable to play. however, it would also definitely make the game easier. the intention of the game was to be 'difficult', with the thought of fun gameplay coming far behind.

i know i'm reiterating, but i very much dislike calling the game 'difficult'. anyone could beat this just by playing it a lot, without really thinking about what they're doing; you can't do that with an actual skill, like piano, which would take a lot more focus and thought in your playing.

[h1] what do i like out of this game? [/h1]

i'm not going to deny that the art style is fantastic--it looks really good, and isn't too obtrusive to how the game plays. i think it's really good, and i can tell that there's thought behind the colouring to make sure that the next place to jump to stands out from the rest of the environment.

that's about it for my praise of the game though; at the end of the day, there really isn't much to pick apart about a game as simplistic as this. 

[h2] tl;dr: [/h2] i don't want to dislike this game; i like the art style, but the enjoyability of it unfortunately feels like an afterthought, behind the desire to make as 'difficult' of a game as possible. the actual jumping mechanic feels too much like muscle memory and not enough like skill to pass off as a truly challenging and fair game to me.

at the end of the day, it's a personal gripe that i'm sure other people won't mind as much. but, as it stands, i wouldn't recommend this game.

[h2] edit: [/h2] i just recompleted getting over it; god, it was a lot more fun than this game. i've come to realise that it's not only the lack of complete control in your gameplay that makes jump king worse, but also the fact that the movement is so incredibly un-dynamic. getting over it feels different every single time you play it (up to a certain point obviously), where there are multiple ways you can tackle each jump. it's a lot more fun compared to the simplicity of jump king, and allows for not only a fun first experience, but a more replayable one as well.

as well as that, i realised that this game feels far too punishing. getting over it is actually very fair, and it chooses to teach new mechanics in a safe environment without a large risk of falling; jump king doesn't do this at all. in fact, for the wind section, i would say that the few screens just under it (which you fall to a lot), are the hardest screens in the game up to that point.

Just like in Getting Over It, you get the streamer/youtuber rage and frustration moments in Jump King that contribute to its popularity. However, Getting Over It also rewards the player for their efforts by allowing them to really utilise what they learn. The part in the beginning of the game that you struggled with for so long will suddenly feel like a brease. You'll make quicker and quicker movement with your hammer, and seeing how far you've come is the motivation that pushes you towards completing the game.

Jump King doesn't have this. The whole gameplay relies on memorizing which spots you jump from and how long you'll need to hold space bar for each spot. The only difficulty is how long you hold the space bar. As a big fan of Geometry Dash, it is impressive how dull this feels to me. Your skill isn't rewarded by cooler more complex movement. It is all just consistency in doing the exakt thing over and over, and it is always the same two outcomes: you fall or you make it. Compare this to Getting Over It, which has a lot more unpredictability and forces you to do quick problem solving in panic, which often can lead to many cool and unique moments.

How fun the gameplay is can often be seen in its speedruns (Celeste, Mario Oddesey, Hollow Knight). Getting Over It has some of the coolest runs I've seen in speedrunning, while Jump King's speedruns look the same as any run, except they don't fall. The few shortcuts that are made and the absence of standing still are the only things that reminds you that it is an actual speedrun.

Jump King is beautiful and the story is funny, but it doesn't have the self awereness and humour that made Getting Over It such a good introduction to these types of games. Bennet will constantly talk in a calm voice in Getting over it, especially after a large fall, since he's awere of how frustrating and stupid the game can feel. He talks as if he's discussing a fine art piece, which only adds to the comedy.

Maybe it all comes down to the fact that I beat Getting Over It and didn't beat this game, but since I ralely give negative reviews and tend to like all games I play, I thought I'd elaborate. Although I'm sure the feeling of finally beating the game probably feels fantastic, I personally don't think it is worth it if the journey feels so bad. And I think that that is probably the hardest challange to get over in the entirety of Jump King. There's no motivation. I'd rather work towards other Steam achivments.

Definately a game more fun to watch than to play imo.

If you manage to get a lot of money from playing, I'm sure you'll be looking more fondly upon this game. I think Dunkey's E3 video shows this quite well (timestamp 0:30 to 1:05):

[quote][b]For Kids games are asset flips [/b][/quote]

[b]But what is an asset flip and why is it so important or even bad?[/b]

[quote=Wikipedia] An [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]asset flip[/url] is a type of shovelware in which a video game developer purchases pre-made assets and uses them to create numerous permutations of generic games to sell at low prices. Such games tend to be viewed by gamers as uncreative, and as diverting attention from less popular high-quality titles. Asset flips have been noted to be a problem on many online distribution platforms, especially Steam. The Nintendo Switch eShop has also been accused of allowing the sale of asset flips. [/quote]

Asset flipping is a term applied to the practice of buying or using basic, pre-made/pre-rendered assets in video game development, without changing them or adding original assets around them. Often used as a pejorative term, and generally consider games made using poorly considered, flipped assets to be shovelware.
For example, say you're a beginner who wants to develop a game in Unity or a similar development engine. If you're a novice, you might buy some assets or a demo game from the Unity Asset Store to use as a foundation for building your first game. Assets like this can also help you have a pre-made world, so you can focus on other areas of expertise, like game physics or enemy AI.

Using assets in this way is fine. In fact, using pre-made assets to make your game is also fine, as long as your game is actually playable. If you've ironed out any glitches, created some nice atmospheric effects, and your characters and NPCs work in harmony, then there's no reason you shouldn't market your game.
However, just throwing a bunch of assets together that don't work, or simply renaming a demo intended as a foundation, in order to just make a game quickly and then market it with no thought, is when asset flipping becomes a nefarious practice.

Basically, there is nothing wrong with using or buying a pre-built asset to use in games.

[b]But if it is offered 1:1 or barely changed as a new game, then it is definitely an asset flip or, in other words, a fake game that only serves to take money out of people's pockets.

And if I'm honest, in this case it really annoys me. On the one hand, because I enjoyed playing some of the games myself as simple games for in between and, on the other hand, because I have recommended many of these games to other parents in order to introduce younger children to the medium of computers and the Internet. It's a shame that the small children's sector is also shamelessly exploited to make money.[/b]

In this case, or as far as all ""My Coloring Book"" games are concerned, For Kids has the Unity [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/paint-book-unity-complete-project-90736 ]Paint Book Unity Complete Project[/url] and simply gave the whole thing a new name.

[b]This also applies to the following, for example:[/b]

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/763760/My_Coloring_Book_Food_and_Beverage/]My Coloring Book: Food and Beverage[/url]
[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/739210/My_Coloring_Book_Transport/]My Coloring Book: Transport[/url]
[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/721430/My_Coloring_Book_Animals/]My Coloring Book: Animals[/url]

Since these games sell well and at ~$4 cannot be described as cheap like many other asset flips, you can calculate how much money For Kids makes here without doing anything for it.

[b]And For Kids almost takes it to the extreme in this regard.[/b]

Here are a few more examples where For Kids used Unity assets and shamelessly copied and published them 1:1:

And there would be more examples ...

Of course, it's up to everyone whether you buy such games or not.

However, it is and remains unethical because it is theft of intellectual property and is essentially nothing more than a cash grab, which also violates the license agreements and terms of use.

In addition, it is simply harmful for the entire games industry and especially for all the indie game developers who often get lost in the mass of such asset flips, which is really a shame.

My Coloring Book: Professions is a Unity Asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", For Kids, took the [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/paint-book-unity-complete-project-90736]Paint Book Complete Project[/url] Unity Store tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, Digi Smile Limited, changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... ""Paint Book Complete Project"" has also been shamelessly dumped on Steam by For Kids, with different stolen artwork:

Because this is an almost exact 1:1 copy + paste of the original Unity asset, it's in violation of the [url=https://unity.com/legal/as-terms]Unity Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA[/url].  Specifically, Section 2, Subsection 2.2.1a:

[quote][i]Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, Licensor hereby grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset solely:(a) to incorporate the Asset, [b]together with substantial, original content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store[/b], into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Assets (""Licensed Product"") as an embedded component of that Licensed Product, [b]such that the Asset does not comprise a substantial portion of the Licensed Product[/b][/i][/quote]

Because the developer misused the asset pack such that it comprises the vast majority of this ""game"", the developer has unethically and deliberately breached the license agreement.  Worse, this intellectual property violation was done in an attempt to profit from their illicit actions.  Why is this permitted on Steam?

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Paint Book Complete Project"" is just a simple click-to-colour virtual colouring book template for mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Another important Note: For Kids have been caught using fake reviews on their games in an attempt to mislead gamers by creating a fake positive review score.  The reviews are all from known/compromised pay-per-review accounts, all in Russian or broken English, and show as Steam purchasers (to make the fake reviews count).  The fake reviews are all posted within roughly 24 hours of each other, and usually shortly after the game launch.  There's no evidence of fake reviews on this game, but that may change in future.  Gamers have a right to know when developers act in a highly unethical manner.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from For Kids.

It is a Rogue game. If you are someone that likes making progress in your games, values a story or actually progressing while playing, look the other way. This genre is terrible if any of the above things matter to you at all.

If however, you enjoy playing the same section of a game over and over again with no save points, no checkpoints, and the smallest mistake forces you to lose everything and do it all over again, this is a game for you!

I was interested in the art style and thought it played like classic side scrollers from ""back in the day"" but that is not the case. Apparently this genre is absurdly popular but having finally gotten around to actually trying this game, I don't understand the appeal. Roguelike and Roguelite are being added to my Steam tag exclusion list.

Dead Cells,588650,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199278354979,"The most overrated roguelite of all time and it's not even close. I'm not sure what it is, I don't understand why, but I feel like this game gets tons of praise that I just don't get. I won't deny visually the game is definitely pretty to look at, but it doesn't really stand out much to me. Not much in this game stands out to me. Tons of cosmetics, tons of weapons, tons of utilities, tons of unlocks, tons of additional things you can get too like bombs or traps; it almost feels, dare I say, bloated. To me personally. But I wonder, why do I love having a ton of unlocks in games like Tboi or Ror2, but with this game I don't care for some reason? I think there may just be something in the core of this game that I don't like.

Some things I just straight up don't like: Level progression. This game's progression across levels feels so, so painfully muddled, and nonlinear. This could be something that very well might be fixed after playing the game for long enough, but dude, it's been 29, almost 30 hours of playtime as of right now. Why do I still not understand how I'm getting to like 70% of the levels I'm in. You start at level 1, then there's the two different level 2's, and then around each of those there's like 5 more levels that, I'm gonna be real, I can't even tell if they're actual main levels or just alternate areas. What the fuck is happening. I've probably been to like 10 different areas in the game so far. If you put a million dollars on the line, and put me in 7 of those areas and asked me ""Where are you in the game right now?"", I still could not give you a straight answer. It's just very needlessly over complicated.

I never cared too much for the combat either. I try to block enemies, but parry timing doesn't feel right that often. This could very well be a me thing but combat just feels very clunky, ESPECIALLY in the later levels when there's more enemies that have more complex and unpredictable attacks that are additionally sometimes stacked on top of each other. It's not the type of thing where enemies take turns either, shit will just attack you and that makes parrying so much harder. On top of this at the end of each level you have one mutation to pick, from a list of like 50+. It's just numbers. It's just a bunch of numbers, more damage when you do this, blocking does this, this ranged stuff is a little better, nothing stands out. It just all feels so lame and not unique or impactful enough at all. That's how a lot of stuff in this game feels for me, just a lot of Quantity > Quality, honestly.

If it sounds like I'm hating just to hate, I definitely get that don't get me wrong, but believe me, I'm not. I am STILL, from time and time again, coming back to this game and playing it for a bit, just to see if something sticks. As of right now though nothing has really grabbed my attention too much from this game. Nothing specific from it has made me truly yearn to come back to it, like a really cool weapon or gimmick or something. I'm just trying to find SOMETHING here, okay? I'm really trying, I promise. I see this game get a lot of positive reception, I want to understand it. This game's probably a better metroidvania than a roguelite honestly, and if that's your jam then that's awesome, dude. I may just not be that big of a fan of metroidvanias. As a big roguelite guy I wouldn't personally recommend it but that's just from my own personal taste.

This is stupid but I have to add this: Guys. This is the year 2025, and we STILL don't have options for adjusting the graphics in our game? Are we actually serious? This game just started running terribly for me as I've been trying to play it again now, with the same computer and everything, and I can't change fps or graphics or anything. I forgot but, I guess it is hard to advance past the prestigious, high-end computer technology of the late 90's. That is fucking INSANE, just ridiculous.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,9.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198025280562,"Continue?9876543210 is literally the most depressing game I've ever played. I don't mean it's just sad, or disheartening, or bad, or deep. It's one of the only pieces of media I've ever experienced that, without fail, makes me feel worse every time I play it. I can read tragic stuff, I can watch sad movies, whatever- occasionally I might even feel teary-eyed- but only Continue? actually makes me feel actually mentally distressed.

In Continue?, you play as the data ghost of one of several failed video game characters, destined for deletion by some sort of cyberspace garbage compactor. In order to survive, you must flee through these strange recycled realms, where everybody talks in an eerie, vaguely poetic dialect of english, mixing terms of faith and hope with computer and video game terminology. Your currency is ""Foo"" (or possibly ""fod"", given the somewhat ambiguous font); your extra lives are ""Spare Parts"". And, most importantly, you are frequently given the choice between two options- ""Lightning"" and ""Prayer"". Every time you choose to take Prayer, you create an extra layer of defence at your next gateway town, meaning Prayer is vital to your success in the game. Every time you choose to take Lightning, you randomly destroy some of the barriers blocking your progress to the next level, making Lightning vital to your success in the game.

The game actually has a really great atmosphere- of inevitable doom and the futility of struggling further. I presume this is the intended effect, because it's actually pretty haunting. Some of the ""lore"", barely comprehensible as it is, actually sticks with you after playing it, the poems and the ""prayers"" of the NPCs you speak to genuinely some impressive alternative writing. The sound and level design also puts forward this idea, especially in the zones between certain levels.

The other thing that contributes to the feeling of dread and nihilistic despair, however, is the gameplay. In order to survive, you must collect Lightning and Prayer, and the game is utterly unforgiving. If you die without a Spare Part to revive yourself, then the game gives you a ""second chance"" by consuming some of the shelters you earned with Prayer. This is, essentially, just a way of making you suffer more. Losing even a few shelters will result in a game over once the storm comes. The rest of the game is a mixture of slightly janky minigames (which punish you harshly for losing, making taking part in the encounters a tense gamble) and a race against the clock to find NPCs to talk to to gain resources from. Several of the NPC interactions are basically just random chance- there are temples, for instance, which reward you for providing the right answer to an abstract and unknowable riddle. If one of the NPCs you met in this run told you the answer, then, so long as you remember it, you can pass the test and gain a large amount of Lightning or Prayer. If, however, you weren't fortunate enough to run into that NPC yet, then you have to either guess or leave, having wasted some of your very limited amount of time in the overworld before it begins randomly collapsing again. 

If you're feeling charitable, you could argue that the clunky gameplay is part of the metaphor- the challenges we face are random because our lives are not designed for us to succeed in. The controls are imprecise because really, how much control do we have over our lives? Or something like that. Alternatively, your character just handles really badly because the game's a bit shoddily programmed.

As an artistic endeavour, Continue? is actually pretty impressive. It's also the most insidiously soul-destroying experience available to you on Steam, which is why I can't really recommend it. Continue? never gives you any answer or comfort about the existential dread it wields- your character is doomed, just as you are doomed, to be erased and become nothing. Some people describe something similar about Dark Souls- sorry for bringing it up- but at least in Dark Souls it's possible to at least kind of achieve something. Continue? presents a world where the player is utterly alone and totally abandoned, faced with an unfair challenge to extend their miserable existence by approximately a couple of hours if they succeed.",False,17,2,1507155416

You can go untouched for half the game only to spawn on the next level with an enemy configuration that is impossible to avoid instadeath. 

Christ. The boss will spawn in the same 3x3 room you spawn in two seconds after starting the level.
I like challenging content. But the map can spawn in any possibly way with no filter. I dont find that fun or challenging. Most of my deaths i load into the next map and gasp because i just got instakilled and dont know why.  Thats not fun or challenging. Its nonsense. 

How does someone improve or get better? 

I spawned and three shotgun snipers were shooting at me and two salamanders were shooting their cone of fire - instakill

I spawn in a 3x3 with two dozen enemies outside already shooting me, boss spawns in my 3x3 before i even walk out - instakilled

I spawn in an corner and theres an explosive barrel next to me, and 5 enemies already shooting me - instakilled

I spawn in the sewer in a 3x3 with a toxic barrel in front of the walkway, and enemy shoots it 2 seconds after spawning - instakilled

I waited a long time to write up my review of Hades 2. I went to play on launch and it just didn't feel right. So I slept on it. It's a Supergiant game, they've earned the benefit of my doubt.
So I play Hades 2 again, made a little more progress and still just...wasn't enjoying the game. Now, I've played every Supergiant game, I've bought Bastion on more platforms than I can remember, I [i]even played Pyre[/i] but Hades 2...it just left a terrible taste in my mouth when I played it. Factually Hades 2 deserves more than 14.4 hours of a review but I just can't wrap my head around the hype and accolades around this game. Did I play the same game everyone else did? Did everyone play Hades 1? Hades 2 goes out of its way to spit in my cereal for liking Hades 1.

[h2]Hades 2 has nowhere to be and hopes you don't either[/h2]
God this game is [i]SO SLOW[/i]. [b]First[/b] and most noticeably the combat has been slowed to a crawl. You get a singular dash now. Forever. No upgrade no boons to give you more. You also have no ranged cast as you would in the first game, now you have an AoE cast* that traps enemies in its area and that means you are either standing where your cast was dropped or you have crowd controlled a group with it and will have to come back and finish that group. Imo, the first Hades was an edge of your seat, frenetic wonderland of fast runs. The only thing stopping you from exiting a room was how fast you could clear the enemies. You could kill bosses before they entered invulnerability! Here in Hades 2 you wait. You wait patiently for your turn, get some attacks in and then get back to waiting. God help you when you get to the Fields of Mourning! *yes I know you can upgrade your cast with boons and change it slightly but never in a way as dynamic as your casts in H1.

[b]Secondly[/b] they added more dialogue. Isn't that good? Yes! and no. In previous games the stellar interactions were a cherry on top between the excellent gameplay stretches. They felt like a reward for making it wherever you were.  I'm unsure when SPG started being known for the writing/VO first and gameplay second (it was Hades 1. Hades 1 had great dialogue AND gameplay and the fanbase just coming in to Hades latched onto the dialogue) but why is the camera panning up and Artemis is singing to me and telling Mel to join in?? Do you know when you got a song in Hades 1? When you earned it by god damn bringing your Mother back to the Underworld, not because you died in the second room of the first area and you just pet your frog. Someone wished for more conversations and boy that monkey paw curled up. Everyone is SO VERBOSE, there's this shade who replaces Hypnos when you die (jk you never die in H2 ;) return to shadow~) and honest to god I've never read an entire conversation from her. I'll walk over to start a new run and [u]dread[/u] seeing a '!' above Nemesis because I know she's going to bend my ear for the next 7 minutes calling me a dumbass shithead for trying to fight Chronos. Simple solution then, don't talk to NPCs, but talking to NPCs and seeing interactions has always been fun in SPG games- there is just SO. MUCH. here. 
And tying the two points together: [b]Bosses are SO quirky and have so much witty dialogue they just HAVE to share BEFORE the fight[/b]. You just want to play the game you bought and have fun but Scylla just won't shuttt uppp and you hover over the refund button but the game deserves a fair shot and aaaaHHHHHHH

[h2]The Field of Mourning[/h2]
Are you serious? This whole level just blows plain and simple. You have an open map, not many discerning features, colors are basically the same everywhere and you have to [u]find[/u] the boons scattered around the [u]empty map[/u] which will then open the exit you must then find in the empty map. Wasn't Hades 1 a fast rip roaring good time? Time to SLOW DOWN. This game has no respect for your time, it is just so slow all the time. Yes, you get a ritual spell that shows you a guide light that *kind of* works (maybe im colorblind i just cant see it) to lead you around the Field of Mourning, but you won't have that spell the first time you go there, and you might not for a few runs!

[h2]Melinoe is a pimp, fuck Zagreus, fuck Hades and fuck Cerberus[/h2]
Okay so this section is going from ""I do not enjoy this game"" to ""I have been called a fool by a studio I've supported for 15 years."" Famously, Supergiant hasn't ever made a sequel. They wrap a game and start up a new project that feels seperate from their other works with it's own ideas. Hades 2 straight up does not feel like a sequel to Hades. It feels like they took whatever project they had in line next (slow, methodical gameplay) and took the name recognition, shuffled some characters around in the background to appeal to veteran players and if you happened to prefer those other characters to these new shiny ones, you are an asshole.
When I play a game I tend to put myself in the shoes of the protagonist, many people do I'd wager, and this game tells you to your face: ""everything you did was for nothing. The family and kingdom you brought back together has fallen asunder to a character you never even knew was a player- your time was a waste."" That doesn't sit well with me personally, but the BIGGEST disrepect SPG has done to their player base involves the third boss. IYKYK but [spoiler]are you fucking kidding me? It's Cerberus, it really actually is Cerberus. Not a shade or some magic whatever or totally unrelated creature but fucking CERBERUS. Zagreus' dog, that you were LITERALLY UNABLE TO INJURE every single run in Hades, you had to go out of your way and find treats to make him move, now HAS to be killed in every single run of Hades 2. And guess what, when you beat the game and everything is asspulled back together, you STILL have to kill Cerberus in every single run post story[/spoiler]. Honestly whoever made that call can go right to hell, that genuinely feels like a slap in the face. And gotta be honest, I didn't beat Chronos! I read a comment detailing the absolutely ridiculous wet fart of an ending that they're already patching out as the true ending and just felt fully deflated.
I give up, for the first time I will not finish a Supergiant game. I will not buy the next Supergiant game no questions asked as I have since Bastion. And (almost) in closing, I've ridden the company Supergiant Games quite unfairly in my review and that just comes from a place of disappointment. I'm truly grateful for all the good years I've spent playing Supergiant Games and I hope their next project is out of this world.

Hades 2 is a good game. I cannot sit here and tell you it's bad. Mechanically it shines, the gameplay is tight and fluid; truly if this was called Melinoe and wasn't [i]directly tied[/i] I wouldn't view it with such vitriol. But it is. This is Hades 2 so it must be compared to Hades 1. There is so much [b]MORE[/b] in Hades 2, the scope is so much more [u]IMMENSE[/u], everything is much [i]RICHER[/i] and sadly, it is inferior in every way to the less of the original.

The majority of the time the option ""Clear Room"" doesn't come up and only says ""Suppress"", so instead of having my team go and clear a room I'm stuck fidgeting with the controls for 10 seconds figuring out the exact spot to stand to make ""Clear Room"" pop up.

Yeah me either. And I don't think any other human being on the planet ever had that thought either with the exception of this game's creator. He felt platforming with the same isometric awkwardness of Super Mario RPG would've been a great addition to the genre. He was wrong.

But once you get past that, the rest of the game plays about how you'd expect a JRPG to play from that era. Lots of classes, class switching, and sub-classes along with learning passives you can use with any class, etc. Very Final Fantasy 5, which presumably is why they called it Crystal Project because you unlock classes from crystals just as you do in Final Fantasy 5.

My only real complaints (aside from the forced inclusion of isometric platforming) are that the game feels ""open"" enough that you can get utterly confused about where you're supposed to go next while also not being an open world at all and having each stage of the game be gated by unlocking everything in each area before moving on. When this game was originally pitched to me, I was under the impression it was more open world, explore as you wish, maybe even randomly generated world every time you play it, but no. None of that. It's the same old world every time and you must do things in a particular order, but there's just enough freedom to move around that you can be unsure of where to go.

Reaching new areas often involves platforming that you may not even realize is an option because it's very unintuitive. For example, I couldn't get into the part of the sewer I needed to be in until I realized that you can jump on top of the flag bannisters while running down the stairs leaving the city to jump up on the wall. There is nothing to indicate that is possible, and if I hadn't toggled on the ""auto jump"" feature, i'd never have smacked into one, prompting me to consider trying to jump on top of one.

But despite how unintuitive all this is, the basic gameplay loop is fun if you enjoy JRPG style games, which I do. I also like that the combat uses threat in the way MMORPGs do, so attacks aren't randomly targeted, they are either AOE or target the highest target on their individual threat lists, so you can have a true dedicated tank for your team. I thoroughly enjoy that. And there are walkthroughs available if you are unsure what to do next.

I give it a solid 7/10. Would've been 10 out of 10 if there was no platforming. I'm still at a loss why anyone thought that would make the game more enjoyable. The only positive thing I can say about the platforming is at least most of the time you straight up fall to your death if you miss a jump, which resets you right back where you were before jumping and there is no ""cost"" associated, like you don't lose HP or whatever, so it's more annoying rather than punishing generally.

Edit: Just got to the desert area. Changed my mind. This game is awful. Isometric platforming is cancer, having to start all over every time is awful, have no option to skip it or make it easier is awful, having to do it all on a keyboard is awful, enemies firing at you like bullets out of a gun CONSTANTLY with fight after fight after fight just trying to do the stupid platforming.

Crystal Project knows what it wants to be. For better or worse.

Playing it felt like playing a Pokemon fan-game: 
+ The game is very transparent about its mechanics. It will straight up tell you that there's ""an NPC later on"" that can help you with something stat-related, for instance. No digging around online for obscure equations necessary!
* Everything feels overtuned. Not even a quarter of the way into the game, everything you encounter will start having some level of resistance to status damage. About a third of the way in, the difficulty starts spiking, and this is probably where most people who are turned off by this game get turned off. By the end of the game, everything will wreck you unless you do some proper metagaming.
- The writing feels at worst rancid and at best nonexistant, with the exception of a single late-game scene that I thought was nicely written. The story is that you're collecting crystals for the sake of collecting crystals. That's not hyperbole, that's [i]literally it.[/i] Which is fine, I guess? The game clearly isn't trying to have a good story. But it's at its worst when the game tries to be funny. Normally I hate being the ""that's not funny"" guy, but it's kind of hard not to be when you can steal milk from every woman and nuts from every enemy that, if you turn off censorship, has it hanging out in the open for some reason? (And this isn't even bringing up the child abuse questline)

The overworld gameplay is... Minecraft parkour map. Your mileage may vary on this, but I for one, only really like this kind of gameplay when it feels like I'm doing something that wasn't intended. Like climbing the side of a steep mountain instead of taking the flat path in front of me. This game... rarely lets you do this (and in fact, most mountains in the game are designed [i]specifically so that this is never possible[/i]), and instead you're subject to a bunch of awkward protrusions that you need to jump between to climb a hypothetical tower. To me, this doesn't look pretty, and it doesn't feel like it flows well. For the most part, this is what the bulk of the overworld gameplay is, and unfortunately, it's probably for the best. Other mechanics get utilized at times, but they don't feel good to play. There's ice block pushing, and as a Sokoban fan, I generally really like these kinds of puzzles, but the absolute lightest nudges will send a block careening in a direction, so you pretty much have to give all ice blocks a wide berth until you know what you're doing with them, because it's [i]very[/i] easy to accidentally send one in the wrong direction. There's also a part of the game that has a stealth mechanic, and it may very well be the single worst stealth section I have ever played in a video game. Enemies will come after you if you make sound, but otherwise ignore you. That's fine. What's not fine is that there is ABSOLUTELY NO LENIENCY TO THIS. The single lightest tap on the controls will alert an enemy. Literally any input. You can wait after moving a tiny bit and the enemies will return to their patrol before they reach you, but this makes for excruciating boredom: Lightly tap a direction, move an inch, wait five seconds, repeat. It feels like you're not actually expected to be stealthy and just fight everything, yet the NPCs keep talking about moving quietly.

The battle mechanics are interesting. Especially the threat mechanic. I think that in particular is a really neat element, but I also think the game would greatly benefit from a means of lowering one's on threat level beyond just waiting it out. Thief, for instance, can barely do anything if their threat level is not the lowest in your party.

Unfortunately, there's also a lot of very questionable decisions with battle mechanics as well. Want to use healing items in battle? Sorry, that's relegated to a specific class's skills. If you don't have someone with that class currently fighting, you can't use them. This means that you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT LET YOUR HEALERS DIE. If you have nobody left standing who can revive, then unless you're already about to win, it's time to resign yourself to your fate, and just watch the rest of your party die. Fleeing? No, that's also a class skill. And not only that, but you normally can't even do it on the first turn. It costs AP, which charges between turns, and it costs two turns of it. It also has a chance of failure. And if it fails, you still lose the AP. And this is in a game where the regular encounters are explicitly designed to give you a tough time.

The worst mechanic of the battles though, I'd say, is the multiclassing system. You'd [i]think[/i] that would be the best part, letting you combine classes in creative ways to optimize your power, and finding synergies that open up entire realms of possibilities. Unfortunately, the game [i]really[/i] doesn't want you to do that, and as such, all weapon skills are locked to one or two specific weapons types, in a game where there's... I want to say at least twelve different weapon types, and your character is only allowed to equip one weapon. This means that there are very few non-magic class combinations that don't leave you with one class of completely unusable skills. Which in turn, severely deterred me from trying new classes. About halfway through the game, I installed a mod to just let me use any skill with any weapon and that alone [i]dramatically[/i] improved my experience. I think this game could've taken a page out of Octopath Traveler's book and let you equip your party with multiple weapons, and they'd switch between them as needed mid-battle.

I get that this is supposed to be a ""hard"" RPG, and, this may just be my own personal taste, but, I'm going to take a moment to compare this to an RPG series that people like to call hard: Shin Megami Tensei. I call SMT a ""Bull**** RPG"", and hear me out here because I say this with not a hint of malice. SMT will steal your bicycle, punch your teeth out, kick you to the curb, and steal your lunch money, all while making yo mama jokes. It's mean, and it games its own system to kick your ass and prevent you from even fighting back. This is [i]why[/i] SMT is called a ""hard"" RPG. HOWEVER, you are given access to the very same tools the game uses to destroy you. You just need to learn them. Once you do, [i]you[/i] will be the one stealing [i]SMT's[/i] bicycle, punching their teeth out, kicking them to the curb, and stealing their lunch money, all while making yo mama jokes. And this is why I call it a ""Bull**** RPG"": The game throws bull**** at you, but you can throw that bull**** right back at it. And once your bull**** throwing outpaces the game's, you feel brilliant, you feel powerful, and before long, you will be laughing maniacally, knowing not even God can stop you. That, and a good story, are the payoffs I look for in an RPG. Since this game has basically no story to lean on, I looked to becoming powerful as a payoff. This never happened. The game is balanced around you hitting the level cap before you beat it, and the game provided no explanation about the final boss, because apparently that gets skipped over entirely in the ""true"" ending. By the end I didn't feel powerful, I just felt tired.

Despite all my complaining, and scathing criticisms, I don't think this game is [i]bad[/i]. I think it just does a lot of things I don't like, in a genre I normally do like. And some of you out there will no doubt love this game to pieces. But I look back on my experience in this game and the word that keeps coming to my mind is ""irritating."" Which, I really hate saying, because I can [i]feel[/i] the developer's passion.

I've also seen other people appreciate the game for its exploration and open endedness and the ability to skip around areas.

I'm 20 hours into the game and I have yet to experience any of those joys or strongpoints of the game. I have not seen a class combo that works well yet and have had to get where I got through grinding. And this is coming from an Octopath Traveler, and Shin Megami tensei(highest difficulty) and FE player.
As for exploration, yes there is quite a lot to explore, but there are barely any ""wonder"" to keep me engage.
The minecraft like art isn't that charming, and there just aren't any unique enemy encounters to keep the grind play.
The platforming is just cumbersome and doesn't really add to the game. The rewards for how much time it takes is just obnoxious.

I think this game was extremely balanced at normal difficulty and I'm not meant to stay in any area for that long (which might be required because of grinding if you are on the hard difficulty)

I get the idea that the things other people love about this game is what I love about Octopath Traveler - cool class combos and skill builds, nooks and crannies to explore. I really really just don't see it in this game. Things kill you in 1-2 hits. You cannot run away from fights. Monster fights are a bit mandatory. You cant use items you've collected. and you run out of MP really really really fast. Like really fast. 

This is definitely a me thing, I also don't like difficulty settings in an RPG - I like to play it on the hardest setting - and hard just means more grinding. If you want - put the setting on hard - and go to the assist mode - and turn up the 3x experience and job points. I've only encountered 2 out of like 10 bosses that were kind of fun to fight. Most bosses will just outright kill you with AOE even with debuff - technical play. I'm not sure what thats about.

TLDR: It's a game with a lot of QoL (but some of it not by default) and many weird or annoying design choices that you may or may not enjoy.

Exploration is the best and worst part at the same time:
·You need to explore whole areas blind before you can obtain the map. Sometimes you have to do weird things to get them and might not realise until too late. 
·You can't directly get the maps for some big transition and late game areas and have to build them from parts you find instead, so you are blind until late game because you need to find the mounts and fully explore them first to get them.
·You need to unlock different mounts to fully explore the map or advance the story but it's a pain in the butt having to change them so often for basic travel.
·There is a late game mount that combines some but not all of them and you have to do a ridiculously long and annoying side quest to unlock it.
·To start battle enemies run at you very fast and you have to somehow dodge them if you don't want to fight, unless you are many levels above them (way too many to be a useful feature). They can also jump so you can't really use the environment to your advantage.
·You can't run from battle unless you have an specific skill equipped in one of your characters that by default needs another one to be used the first turn.
·Platforming can be too finicky and precise and the fixed camera works against you all the time.
·There is an auto-jump option that can help with that but you need to be constantly turning it on and off in the settings, as there is no key-bind and in some places it hurts more than helps.

Combat and character building:
·There is no defend command, but you can pass turn, and see what the enemies are going to do next.
·You can't use items mid fight.
·There is an aggro system that makes it hard for your DPS characters to not die quickly because they get focused first, and the aggro changes on the fly makes it sometimes unpredictable.
·You can use aggro manipulation skills that some tank classes have but 80% of enemies kill you in 1 or 2 hits. Stat scaling is weird.
·For most casters the spells are delayed and the turn order also changes on the fly so you have to keep that in mind too. It also makes aggro manipulation harder.
·Enemies can crit you and will make you cry :_)
·Difficulty option feels like it doesn't change much?
·There are many classes and combinations available but the skills that they can use are limited by equipped weapon so you can't really combine most of them. This leaves you with only a handful of viable class combinations and half disabled skill lists.
·Lack of item variety. No accessories for half the status effects and stats.

Other things:
·Story is basically non existent, so you better enjoy the gameplay.
·Post-game content that lets you enjoy your completed characters is very limited.
·There are many quality of life options available in the settings, which is fantastic, but the game feels like a chore if you play without them enabled. By default you can't teleport between save points for example.
·It has official mod tools and support which is very nice.

I do respect the developer for making the game hard, but it falls into the ""every battle is the same"" problem that is shared by games that are too easy.

Too easy: Mash attack every battle
Too hard: Pick the exact same options every battle to grind for resources until you can pick the exact same options for enough battles in a row to get past the area.

It's telling that all the recommended mods are basically cheats.

So what makes a hard JRPG fun? Lets take Final Fantasy 1: Origins for example (not to be confused with the very easy Anniversary Edition).

In FF1, most battles could be easily won in isolation, but you can't try to wipe the floor with every encounter without running out of resources, so you hold back. It's a constant balancing act between how much power you're willing to burn vs how close to death you're willing to take your characters.

I get the concept of exploration for side stuff but the main-quest line isn't very neatly packed together so you end up lost easily.  Past JRPGs solved this by having NPCs with general directions or bars/taverns where you could talk to NPCs about rumors.  The Map isn't really any help because it is just an overview of the area without landmarks or paths detailed. If I could pull up the map and see that there is some general path to go to the next town or dungeon I wouldn't have an issue with it. 

If You're fine with grinding and wandering around a lot, this is probably very fun for you. I enjoy my JRPGs to have a lot of direction from NPCs or a useful map so I know where I am going.

------

Since my Last comments, I just don't know. It manages to be so fun to grind, find crystals and work with the job system. Could easily see myself spending much more time aimlessly killing mobs. I can't recommend this to people who are looking for story but if you just want a JRPG you can mess around in for a couple hours, this is it.

------
While I really enjoy the game I can't recommend it to other people because it's difficulty is so superficial. I'm not annoyed that everything I do just isn't working but more so it feels like there is a very narrow amount of possibilities that will work at times. You don't get very much direction on what to do in the game, which becomes an annoying realm of wandering around in big empty spaces looking for any mystery or clue to a crystal. The Classes are good but none of them feel very complete as your reward for mastering so many isn't even the ability to use the class specific ability with other classes. You absolutely need a mage as much as you need healing as much as you need items but the game is dense in cheap elements of difficulty. 

Can't run from fights unless I have a specific ability to do that. Can't use Items in battle with the same class unless it is unlocked. More annoyingly is you can't exactly attach these necessary parts of the combat to give you at least some edge to overturn a battle that's going particularly bad. Items are so expensive early game, if you don't grind and late game if you want good ones. however, you can't use items during battle unless you are the class with access to items or have the item ability sub command. You end up having to fight so hard to do big damage but all of the enemies are geared up with full party nukes. Its not even in a fair way where you can use a tank to pull the attention from a enemy to do single attacks. Nope, everyone gets smacked to almost 0 health and some KO on every few turns. If you're losing a fight, there is no way to swing the momentum back in your favor and enemies seem to have unlimited amounts of AP and MP to use any kind of extremely devastating attack they want. It just isn't much fun to deal with the combat at all so I end up avoiding nearly every enemy in the game and trying to not fight bosses. I want to take this game as far as it will go because it is such a brilliant concept. Just some balancing and this becomes a really fun game.",False,14,1,1747666954

Elden Ring,1245620,59.99,16,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, RPG",76561198013325883,"The most overrated game of all time.

Let me be clear: I don’t mind difficulty. In fact, I’ve loved challenging games since childhood. I enjoy learning from my mistakes, improving, dying, trying again, and beating bosses. I defeated 30–40 bosses in Elden Ring without giving up, raging, or complaining about the difficulty.

My issue is not difficulty, it’s everything else.

Story & Worldbuilding

Yes, the world of Elden Ring can be huge, rich, and deep. But a world that big shouldn’t be this vague. The “story” basically consists of a guy shouting at the beginning and a handful of cryptic NPCs who talk like they’re solving riddles. That’s simply not for me.

I want to engage with a story.
I want an actual script, a main quest that makes sense, something to pull me into the world.
I shouldn’t have to check item descriptions or chase random weird NPCs across a massive map just to understand the basics of the lore. (Lore of the world, not the story)

Some players enjoy that style and that’s completely fine, but I don’t.

Gameplay.....

This is where the game completely loses me.

Elden Ring still uses the same old formula from 2007: slow, clunky, roll–dodge–hit combat that becomes extremely repetitive after a while. After a masterpiece like Sekiro, I genuinely thought FromSoftware would push their combat systems forward. Instead, they went backward.

Sure, there are tons of builds and creative options. But at the end of the day, every boss fight ends up feeling like you're just a rolling Pokémon waiting for openings. It’s uninteresting and dull.

Visuals & Exploration

I’ll give credit where it’s due: visually and structurally, the world is stunning. I normally hate getting lost in video games, but Elden Ring’s worldbuilding makes exploration rewarding, every corner has something to discover, and that’s a huge positive.

But in the end, amazing exploration doesn’t mean much when:

1)The story gives you nothing to hold onto, and

2)The combat system feels boring and outdated.

Conclusion

I respect people who love this game, everyone has different tastes. But I genuinely cannot see the appeal. After 42 hours of boredom, I have to drop it midway.

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198002685219,"Fromsoft once again fails to demonstrate improvement in areas where they struggle.

There is little reason that a studio like Fromsoft should struggle with displaying the correct button prompts for controllers in a game so clearly primarily designed for consoles.  The first bossfight is also poorly timed, with it clearly intending the player to use mechanics that are not explained until tutorials are accessed after the bossfight is successfully completed.  I suspect this second failure is due to poor planning on Fromsoft's part, with the introductory mission and boss being designed and implemented after the rest of the game was a finished piece - the studio has a history of such directorial blunders.

The game also seems to fall into the trap of attempting to display simplified stats for things like weapons while at the same time hiding useful information, leaving players relying on dataminers and extensive, laborious in-game testing to establish what *exactly* weapons do.

Additional features are poorly implemented.  The store system is unnecessary, providing no true limit on player builds past the very early game.  Engine load and weight already provide the necessary tools for balance.  Since you can buy and sell for the same price, in practice you simply buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell...it interrupts the flow of building, making the act of customizing your mecha a gigantic chore.

The story, as far as I have gotten, is poorly written and full of dull, unlikable characters with far too much dialogue for what they actually have to say.

Important missions are designed to be played halfway, failed, and restarted once the player has had a chance to tune their gear.  This is due to how the bossfights work, which are dependant on you having certain equipment to make them go by quickly enough to not drag on forever.  It's clear the devs are desperate for you to take a blade with you, but they only give you one blade for an extended period of time and it's kind of miserable to use.  It takes up a hand slot despite being  a wrist-mounted device.  You don't get any money for a failed mission, so it's just a way to waste player time.  

The ""voice in your ear"" characters are annoying to listen to, and only rarely have something useful to say.  Most of the commentary they give is cliche, and not in a funny way.  Just in a dull, unimaginative, hacky way.  Remember in Halo 2, how annoying it was to hear Cortana repeat the same voice line four or five times while trying to beat the game on higher difficulties?  It's that, but the character speaking never has any good lines to make up for it.  At least Cortana's lines in these situations tended to be more than ""Don't let him bait you.  Focus.""  

(Side Rant: He's not baiting ME you dumb fuck, he's baiting YOU.  I don't know who he is, I don't know who he's talking about, I don't give a single flying fuck about any of it.  Shut the hell up and let me do my job.  Like, at least do something useful and jam his comms so I don't have to hear his smug-ass dialogue)

Unfortunately, major mech games are rare and so it's still likely worth playing this game if you like mechs and can roll with the punches.  DO NOT pay full price for this title.  Fromsoft needs to be held to a standard appropriate for a professional, well-funded AAA studio.

Anyone who has skid marks and sits in their gaming chair all day will tell you to git gud, that it's a skill issue, as if we all aren't aware that they achieve nothing but sinking thousands of hours into a game that rewards their lack of employment. And don't raise your pitchforks, because I'm one of em. 

Sekiro is another title that has been plagued. It's manageable for a while - through all the perilous deflects, the prosthetic arms, and the filter mini-bosses. It's immersive, it does stealth mostly right, and the exploration is peak. But at some point along the line, Sekiro becomes less of a fun learning curve and more of an annoyance; with repetitive enemies and bosses that have some bullshit gimmick, a tracking windup, ridiculous attack speeds & aggro ranges, or homing projectiles. And that's what makes it another load of waste born from the FromSoft sewage pipe.

I know it's Early Access, but holy moly is this ever rough around the edges. A lot of basic tutorials that you'd expect to get are simply not there, and the AI is pretty much ""run in straight line and attack, repeat"" for every enemy- which can still be difficult because enemies are often just spammed at you from spawners you can barely see and any attacks from behind count as backstab, even for enemies. So an enemy you didn't even know had spawned behind you can one shot you.

Which brings me to my next major gripe:  Darksouls style artificial difficulty.  Some traps and even simply existing in some areas will INSTANTLY KILL YOU. With no warning or indication whatsoever. The worst being the Shroud itself. The game doesn't tell you there are multiple ""levels"" of shroud, which to the player just looks like fog. There is no distinction between levels apparently. So you can be walking through shroud and be fine, then simply touch a higher level shroud and just instantly die. Insult to injury is that the game flashes a message on your screen warning you that you're IN a harder shroud area. *After* you are dead.

Being a caster is kind of a joke, as staffs require mana AND ammo, which is a huge pain in the ass to get mats for early on. Then there's the game's automatic target locking. You can't freely aim, you are stuck locking onto enemies and it can seriously screw you over if you're trying to shoot a barrel next to an enemy because. While I only found out later you can hold T and it will cancel target lock but only while holding T. There's permanent toggle.

While working through my games backlog, I like to pace myself by playing one fairly ""normal"" game and following that up with something weird as hell. [b]Golden Light[/b] falls firmly in the latter category; however, what started as a very intriguing premise would turn out to be a bit of a disappointment.

In Golden Light, our unnamed protagonist descends into the depths of the Gut searching for She, his lost lady love. Here, the Gut serves as both the environment and the antagonist, becoming angrier and more hostile the more enemies you kill. And if you find it all too much to bear, you can always appease it by hurting yourself or making offerings…

From what I saw, the story in Golden Light closely follows the Silent Hill ""formula"" (or at least, what's been accepted as the Silent Hill Formula over the years): our protagonist is lost and trapped in a purgatory-like place, searching for a loved one. This fairly well-worn base is then topped with a generous smattering of meat and weirdness (with a sprinkle of Cronenberg and Lynch), giving Golden Light a unique and genuinely unsettling vibe.

Look, I'ma be real - I'm not a huge fan of games whose idea of horror is enemies barrelling down towards me, screaming bloody murder. And since this is basically Golden Light's main shtick, I think you'll understand why I dropped it so quickly.

If you're OK with constant, annoying jump scares, I think there's actually something to Golden Light. The meat aesthetic alone is unique enough to merit at least giving it a try, and for all I know, the story might go deeper than the surface-level stuff I saw would suggest.",False,2,0,1756381812

1. The game is a walk in the park... For calling itself a soulslike it is way too easy. I actually did every single boss first try except (ironically) the very first one where i died once cause i wasnt familiar with the movement of my own character. At the whole 12 hour run I only died 3 times even though im by no means a god gamer... im a soulslike fan so i actually enjoy getting my ass spanked by a hard game which this game sadly could not deliver the slightest.

2. The maps all look similar especially the first 3-4 big regions so it is too monotonous for my taste. Got a bit better to the end of the game but the start was too equal looking.

3. Mob recycling is crazy in this game... Holy shit there are actually only like 5 types of enemie which get recycled throughout the whole game by getting a different weapon or element but basically still being the same enemy.

4. As mentioned earlyier its too pricey for what it brings to the table. I would say a fair price would be 20€ but would strongly advise against buying it for everything above that price.

[b]Among Us[/b]. You know it, you love it. Or do you? The more they added to this game, the less fun it became to play. The simplistic nature of the older versions was what was so charming about it. The newer roles actually make the game less fun. This game is stuck in a rare limbo where adding more content actively makes it worse...hide and seek is good, though.

On top of that, the playerbase and culture you remember has completely changed, the heights of COVID, which I have great memories of, may never be replicated again.

Sea of Thieves,1172620,19.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure",76561198220478095,"Before you buy :)

Can I play this while having a job

Yes. The game does not really keep long term progression. When you log out the only things that stay are your gold and the ship you purchased. All loot like cannonballs and food disappears. Good for players who cannot commit every day.

Are you a PVP player

If you enjoy PVP this game is very fun. Everyone has the same gear so skill is what matters. No pay to win and no advantage for older players. Just get good.

Can I play this every day

You can but expect the game to feel repetitive.
After reaching Pirate Legend you have basically completed the main goal. Everything after that is for cosmetics titles and achievements. These do not help in combat. Flexing on hoes is what matter at this point.

PVP Experience

Outside Hourglass fights a normal ship battle can last 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the players and the ship sizes. Sometimes you will fight two players or even four players while you are alone or with one friend. This can be exciting or frustrating. Just get good.

PVE Experience

Megalodon is scary the first time but after a few encounters it becomes simple. Just sail to the nearest island and it will disappear. Kraken is not really threatening. The water becomes dark you cant sail just fight not really hard. Skeleton ships and storms annoying you can sail around the storm just annoying since you delaying going to your destination for skeleton ship the loot is okay but not amazing. World events are a mix of PVP and PVE but nothing too special after a while.

My Thoughts

Sea of Thieves is very fun with friends but boring alone unless you want cosmetics or achievements.

Traveling takes most of the play time. You will sail for around five minutes or more for every island. A single quest can take two to three hours and more than 60% of that is just sailing with nothing happening.

Crew limit is four players. You can form alliances to make groups. I myself played with 8 people you can do this by sever hopping and spawning with a galleon until at least 2 play from your team find a match on the same server. This is fun when you are part of it but not fun for everyone else.

Pets

Pets look nice but they do nothing helpful.
It would be better if monkeys fed you or if dogs helped you find treasure faster. Right now pets are only for looks and nothing else.

Battle Pass

You can earn Ancient Coins without buying the pass but it is very rare.

Final Verdict

Sea of Thieves is amazing with friends but becomes repetitive fast.
Great for players who enjoy PVP and want a relaxed sailing adventure.
Not great for players who want strong progression or deep PVE.",False,0,0,1764164544

Now after the things I have witnessed and heard in this game I dont recommend it to anyone. I'm even going out of my way to write this review and scare children away.

-PARENTS BE WARNED-

Vrchat is NOT a game for children under the age of 16/18 (depending on their country) It is a Lalaland without authority which is full of degenerate/mentally ill/lost to addiction adults who will not care for your childs well being. If anything a great amount will do them harm mentally or expose them to addiction and other 18+ content. A small group will even try to extort them or physically harm them. If you thought the stories coming from roblox are bad, its been like this on vrchat for quite some time now.
 
I started playing this game years ago when I was in my early 20's, the majority of poeple did not own a vrheadset. Seeing anyone with one let a lone with full body tracking was rare and special. If anything they where consideret expensive. its wild to me that children get gifted a vrheadset with unsupervised acces to certain games. 

Eitherway, in the beginning it was great when I did not own a vrheadset/full body tracking. I met a  decent amount of good poeple and had loads of fun with them exploring the world of vrchat. After a year or so I got my first vrheadset and shortly after full body tracking as well, by this time a decent amount of the good poeple had moved on with their life as they did not invest in a headset. After buying the vrheadset it all went down hill as I felt obligated and excited to play vrchat for as long as a I could even sleeping in it ocasionally. 
Owning a vrheadset and full body tracking opens acces to certain activities and poeple that otherwise would not interact with you if you didn't have tracking. It became a feeding source of various addictions and eventually leading to mental illnes. I would say the pandemic did a great number on that front as a lot of things you where not allowed to do in the real world anymore, you could still do on vrchat (for example partying/clubbing) Besides who you meet on vrchat will never only stay on vrchat, it will move on to discord, snapchat ect.

Vrchats community simply makes and breaks the game. Its a great thing that there is so much space for creative outlet, creating worlds and your own characters. But without authority and management it turns into a toxic lalaland where poeple can do as they please. 
There are safety opptions the player can take themselfs but how realistic is it that easily influenced children will actually make use of that...

Although vrchat implemented age verification it doesn't solve anything since its up to whoever creates the world instence to implement the age verification. That makes it so that adults who don't want to interact with minors create a safe space for themselfs away from minors. What ever is done by players in public lobbies or private lobbies is not moderated what so ever. They can regulate to some extent the content that gets released on the game but they can't regulate what poeple say/do in that virtual world.

Stadium is another problem, isn't it wonderful to run into a hard counter and just feel useless for the whole match?

This is a continuation on the balance problems, but stadium's shop and the perk system in both also suck, the changes are of wildly different quality, some characters get really good horizontal progression and new abilities, some just get a slight vertical improvement, and some (Lifeweaver lifegrip minor perk) get what should be base kit. The balance is also factoring these in too, balancing the perks and base kits around them, which is dumb.

It is a Game that in every moment you will encounter a constant go to this website and follow this build guide, even getting help from other players amounts to a simple, Forget your gear forget your Gems and i dont care what your current passive skill tree choices are, Wear these Items i Crafted for you, Use this Weapon I have for you, And Follow this Strategy and you will succeed. 

I am just tired of games that boast as having a massive level of freedom and endless possibilities but actually have 0 of anything that is not mitigated by the caveat of Umm Actually you have the freedom to choose which guide to follow but if you want to just experiment then you will not be able to finish the game nor will you be able to do anything endgame because the Enemies will just kill you outright and you will just come away from your sessions feeling Pissed off and Tired of the fact that you if you Did screw up your skill tree then You have to wait until the next season for a free reset, Which is another retarded bit in its own right. 

Personal Aside Passive Tree Full Reset: So they dont bother to tell you when you use their free reset that not only does it reset your main passive tree but it also resets your endgame atlas tree, so if you ground out your passive tree like i did then you now are told Hehe do it again. Like Im SORRY BUT GRINDING GEAR GAMES SHOULD STAND FOR GANGBANG GRAPE AND GREPEAT. now that that is out of my system

SO if you dont have this full skill tree wipe how can you undo your mistaken or wrong choices on the tree, well i will tell you that Unless you have been grinding every single map killing every thing for 10 hours a day the likelyhood aside from buying gold from a website selling it is squat. It costs about 4-5k gold to gain a skill removal token, at endgame your looking at around 100 skills you have spent. if your thinking to yourself that thats not too bad sure if you didnt get gold at a rate of 20-50% drop chance for each monster you kill granting you less than 20 per drop in act 1, less than 30 in act 2 and up to 50 in act 3. so looking at the math each point you need to undo is gonna be ground out at 80-300 drops of gold at the 50% or less drop chance while in act 3.

Tier 17 maps are awful. Not because they're hard, but what makes them hard. These modifiers are unbelievably strong. They create incredibly small niches that allow certain builds to thrive and leave everything else to die... literally. In a game that is all about builds and build-crafting, you get punished extremely heavily for attempting to step outside of meta builds. The other issue with endgame is 95% of deaths are to insane 1-shots. Most of the time it's very hard to know what you died to. This leads to deaths being even more frustrating due to not being able to improve your character in a more concrete way. Most upgrades to my character after a few deaths tend to be more broad defensive upgrades based on stats. Mostly feels like meaningless gameplay that only leads to frustration.",False,1,0,1764114961

Game is very difficult to learn. The tutorial system is worthless, doesn't help you learn combat, doesn't help with gem sockets in gear and what the different color sockets are for. I am unable to find any gems that will work in the armor or shield slots. (All the gems I have found or seen from vendors are for weapons only and the descriptions are lacking in how the gems will interact with each other. Everything is guess work and I am unable to tell certain gems even do anything).

You get an arm that you need to graft to your body ... but how to do that? Fortunately the steam community told me how to equip it (it was hidden box on the left side of the inventory screen). Updating this arm is also confusing and complicated. 

Items tale up way to much space in the inventory which is very limited and you can't increase the size of you backpack. I read that this is due to the designers wanting players to carefully choose what items to pick up. Problem with this ... you need to be able to sell items in your inventory to gain trade currency so you can buy stuff. You also need to sell stuff from inventory so you can get wisdom scrolls so you can identify items.

There is no way reliable way to return to towns/camps to sell inventory. Portal scrolls are few and far between. Way points are also few and far between. If you run back to town, then everything resets and you have to start exploring the area(s) again.

The game doesn't save area progress and if you leave an area you have completed the area resets and you have to do the whole area again.

If you fail a quest, that is it. You can't get the quest back, restart it, and if it is a quest that you need to progress the story ... well, the only option I found is to delete the character and start all over again.

Items that you need to use (scroll of wisdom to identify items, town portals, and other items to improve gear) is also currency to buy/upgrade gear. The gold you find is basically useless because you can only gamble it for unknown items.

I bought the map board. (Spent real money on this). After I bought it, I found out that it was worthless because you can only use it after you finish the campaign. (I believe this is a scam for me to spend money on an item I would not need because after I complete the campaign then what use will this be? (The campaign is done).

The developers keep stacking new systems, new calculations, and massive on-screen load without ever proving they can handle the fundamentals. If you can’t design scalable systems or maintain server stability, you shouldn’t keep piling more complexity on top — it only exposes the weaknesses even more.

The result is the same: lag spikes, server stutter, desync, and performance issues that follow you no matter your hardware. Once high pack size, multiple league mechanics, or heavy monster density appear, the game stops feeling like an ARPG and starts feeling like a stress test for bad infrastructure.

What’s most painful is that it feels like the team doesn’t understand their own engine anymore. The systems don’t work together, the servers can’t keep up, and the technical debt is so obvious that players can predict exactly when the game will break. That kind of failure doesn’t come from lack of resources — it comes from lack of direction.

And to make it worse, there’s the long-standing issue that regular players constantly struggle with lag while certain streamers seem to enjoy perfectly smooth performance. Whether it’s priority servers, special queue placement, or some form of backend favoritism, the outcome is the same: one group gets flawless gameplay while everyone else suffers. That disparity alone speaks volumes about where the attention goes — and where it doesn’t.

If the people responsible for these core systems truly believe this level of performance is acceptable, then that alone says everything. Sometimes the hardest truth is this: when a team refuses to improve the basics, it’s a sign they’ve reached the limits of what they can do.

The game is brilliant at its core, but the technical foundation is so poorly handled it overshadows everything good about it.",False,0,0,1763855038

One cutscene dumping a decade of Destiny lore in a minute is not really the play in terms of good story telling.

Additionally the vaulting of content is the dumbest thing ever. It's 2025 and they haven't figured out how to add content without needing to subtract content. Meanwhile look at other free to play games like Warframe which continue to improve on the new player experience and add new content while keeping old content completely 100% playable. Every change is either an addition or something that genuinely was better for the game.

Destiny 1 was the better game and it's a shame we never got a PC port. Destiny 2 needs to improve the new player experience and return the vaulted content. If it did that it would be a genuinely good game.

With ups and downs, when they launched The Final Shape, we tought they would come back and be what the players wanted. We were very wrong.

Destiny used to be a unique game. ""Planets"" to visit, amazing campaign, well written villains and characters in general. With some teaks here and there, some QoL changes (like Lfg, loadouts and subclasses 3.0), legendary campaign for the old ones (Red War, CoO, Wm and Forsaken) and also, some changes of bosses mechanics would make Destiny a desirable game to play. Now it's just menus and cards (Portal), content we paid for is gone for good, new locations are not that interesting and not worth visiting. When Destiny was ""not so good"", even Mercury were packed with players. 

Now i feel that i don't even need locations to go and that's one of the reasons that made me quit Destiny. You could just chill in IO, Titan, Mercury or Mars. You could chase the meta or just play the game the way you want. We had fun, now Bungie is a generic company.

I felt robbed when they sunsetted the content we paid for but i stuck cuz the narrative was good and we still had some uniqueness to the game. Now we don't.

Maybe i will come back one day and edit this, saying that they gave us back what we paid for, but i highly doubt and that just makes me sad, because i really miss the ""Journey"" that Destiny used to be (yeah, the feeling of the game and the best music they made)

Bungie should have walked away in 2020, while people were still applauding. But they insisted on milking it dry for profits and Pete Parsons very basic taste in classic cars.
I discovered Destiny in those years when Borderlands 2 had grown stale as yesterday's bread. And one boring day in school,  before me opened a pure greatness of game universe, that is a cathedral of a game design. A space western without tacky laser cowboys. Futuristic industrial design – sublime, functional, memorable – fused with magic that felt real and harked back to magic lore and mythology of our real world.
The first cracks on facade and mold in the basement appeared in Season 8. Patchnotes. ""Shake up the meta,"" they proclaimed, as if a hurricane in a china shop constitutes strategy. Massive damage nerfs to weapons and unique traits of armor.
Sunsetting... that was the moment when the roof caved in and walls began to bulge. They took our weapons – not just items, you see, but time made tangible. Hours of our lives, god rolls we treasured like family heirlooms... all discarded with a corporate smile about ""player experience.""
And then – slow rot. Content became faceless. Witch Queen briefly lit the old light in the windows, Final Shape reminded us what this building could have been... but the foundation was eaten through. No weapon felt meaningful. No activity – irreplaceable. Class building? A lick of a fresh paint on a bumpy hardwood floor and a new layer of a plaster on a bulged walls, that was carried out for too long, and amounted in too little result.
In 2018-2020 they gave us a cathedral. Magnificent. Singular. Then they buried that potential under layers of corporate incompetence and the paranoid fear of giving players too much.

The cyberware feels half-baked, the perk system still feels like a first draft, melee feels basically unusable at higher difficulties, the writing is either pretty decent or just abysmal, a lot of the quest design is pretty boring and underdeveloped, the main quest ends right as it seems like it is about to get really interesting, and the city itself feels flat. It's got a lot of pretty buildings to look up at, but there is basically no meaningful verticality that the game plays with. At full price, I can not in good faith recommend the game. 

Phantom Liberty is a little better, I would probably rank it independently at around a 7/10 or maybe an 8/10, but that is mainly just because the writing and quest design is better and a lot tighter than the main game.

Movement is a little too floaty, feeling similar to ARK.

I know it's Early Access, but holy moly is this ever rough around the edges. A lot of basic tutorials that you'd expect to get are simply not there, and the AI is pretty much ""run in straight line and attack, repeat"" for every enemy- which can still be difficult because enemies are often just spammed at you from spawners you can barely see and any attacks from behind count as backstab, even for enemies. So an enemy you didn't even know had spawned behind you can one shot you.

Which brings me to my next major gripe:  Darksouls style artificial difficulty.  Some traps and even simply existing in some areas will INSTANTLY KILL YOU. With no warning or indication whatsoever. The worst being the Shroud itself. The game doesn't tell you there are multiple ""levels"" of shroud, which to the player just looks like fog. There is no distinction between levels apparently. So you can be walking through shroud and be fine, then simply touch a higher level shroud and just instantly die. Insult to injury is that the game flashes a message on your screen warning you that you're IN a harder shroud area. *After* you are dead.

Being a caster is kind of a joke, as staffs require mana AND ammo, which is a huge pain in the ass to get mats for early on. Then there's the game's automatic target locking. You can't freely aim, you are stuck locking onto enemies and it can seriously screw you over if you're trying to shoot a barrel next to an enemy because. While I only found out later you can hold T and it will cancel target lock but only while holding T. There's permanent toggle.

I will say, the story is by far the strongest part of this game. I also really like that the devs tried a new spin on the genre, by adding interesting movement abilities. However, the levels were a bit too simple to really let these shine (even when backtracking, these abilities were used in pretty simplistic ways). 
The combat was okay, there were only a couple of weapon types (though they came with different special attacks, they were largely the same). The enemy variety was good considering the short runtime. 
The combat overall was really easy even w/o the assist mode. The bosses were a letdown - they were incredibly easy, and didn't really have any moves or combos to worry about. Also, their attack hitboxes were *really* bad - a lot of them you could just hug and they'd not be able to hit you with most of their attacks.

It is typical of a dark souls type of game with steep learning curve and monsters that respawn after each death or interaction with saving point.

I get tired of the unending grinding of games like this, where your progress don't mean shit if you havent reached a saving point. Killing 50 monsters just to die to the boss, and then having to kill them all again, is not my idea of fun.

The tutorial/first level of this is by far the most difficult part and if you can get by that on default difficulty, then you can beat the game easily.

The game itself was fun however there were a few things about it which i did not like and make the game definetily not worth the full price.

1. The game is a walk in the park... For calling itself a soulslike it is way too easy. I actually did every single boss first try except (ironically) the very first one where i died once cause i wasnt familiar with the movement of my own character. At the whole 12 hour run I only died 3 times even though im by no means a god gamer... im a soulslike fan so i actually enjoy getting my ass spanked by a hard game which this game sadly could not deliver the slightest.

2. The maps all look similar especially the first 3-4 big regions so it is too monotonous for my taste. Got a bit better to the end of the game but the start was too equal looking.

3. Mob recycling is crazy in this game... Holy shit there are actually only like 5 types of enemie which get recycled throughout the whole game by getting a different weapon or element but basically still being the same enemy.

4. As mentioned earlyier its too pricey for what it brings to the table. I would say a fair price would be 20€ but would strongly advise against buying it for everything above that price.

I spent a lot of frustrating time looking for a way to adjust the controls without saving and quitting before I realized that ""save and quit"" was some imbecile's way of saying of ""save settings"".

Everything else here is here to fill the page. This is a highly derivative game in a saturated class of games that I am sick to death of.

The idea is honestly fantastic. You’re in this alternate version of Paris where robot soldiers patrol the streets and the city’s in chaos. It sounds cool, right? It even looks cool at first. But it gets boring fast. I'm tired of the boring AF DS tropes/mechanica and lack of imagination in how the game works. Soulslikes need to come up with a way to feel different. This one doesn't. Not that many do. And (as usual with what seems like all soulslikes) also plays like crap on PC, and was clearly only really intended for the console audience. I have a PC interface. USE IT. I'm sick of tabbing through items and other assumptions of a controller-only setup. I'm just not interested in playing anything anymore (period) that doesn't take advantage of the fact that I have a proper set of PC input devices at my disposal.

The combat never feels quite right. Everything feels a bit floaty, like your attacks don’t really connect. Enemies are mostly the same few types repeated over and over, and the boss fights just drag on forever. There’s no real excitement to them, just a lot of health bars and awkward timing.

Exploring the city is kind of boring too. The areas look nice but they all blur together. It feels like you’re being guided through narrow paths pretending to be open streets. You keep looping back on yourself for no good reason, and the rewards for exploring aren’t worth it anyway. The world just feels empty. Pretty, but dead.

Performance isn’t great either. The game stutters sometimes even on a good PC, and the animations are stiff. The story wants to be deep and meaningful but it’s so flat that it never lands. Everyone talks like they’re reading lines off a script, and I stopped caring about the plot halfway through.

It’s a shame because there are moments that almost work. The designs of the machines and costumes are amazing, and the first time you see the city on fire is genuinely striking. But that makes it worse in a way, because you can see what the game could have been.

In the end, Steelrising feels like a beautiful idea that never made it out of the prototype stage. It’s not awful, but it’s not fun either. It just kind of clanks along until you give up.",False,3,0,1761510073

I've been through like 3 or 4 levels and I can already feel the enemy reuse.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198047984519,"Steelrising sounds like such a great idea on paper. Imagine an alternate history version of the French Revolution where King Louis XVI actually manages to defeat the revolutionaires with an army of clockwork automatons. Even better, you yourself are a former dancer-automaton named Aegis, tasked by Queen Marie Antoinette to find your maker, Eugène de Vucanson, and eventually fight your way through Paris to stop the King himself.

It’s an amazing premise, and having visited Paris a number of times I was excited to see how developers Spiders would bring this alternative history version to life. Unfortunately, a great concept cannot make up for unimaginative and repetitive level design, poorly-implemented combat, terrible optimisation, and a level of jank that is difficult to put up with.

Let’s start with the good stuff. You do get to see a handful of the capital’s iconic locations, including Versailles, Notre Dame, La Louvre, Les Tuileries and, of course, The Bastille, even if once you actually get inside you discover they all share a very similar set of assets. I enjoyed the different historically-inspired clothing here as well, and those that enjoy a bit of fashion souls can find plenty of tricorne hats and frilly shirts to suit their fancy. There are only seven main bosses in the game, but they are all fairly different, with interesting move-sets that need to be learnt to beat them. Finally, the map to travel around Paris is a nice touch too, rendered as a piece of old parchment.

Unfortunately, that’s more or less where the good stuff ends. I disliked Aegis’s move animation immensely. She’s either walking far too slow, or running far too fast in a disjointed, weird-looking sprint. Jumping is finicky and imprecise, only slightly alleviated by some extra traversal moves you get later into the game. Combat is strangely unresponsive : I often got the impression my character would dodge a second or so after I pressed the button, and the hit-boxes are very strange, with both my weapon and the enemies passing through me without either of us getting hit. 

My weapon of choice, the trust halberd, has an almost laughable range, and you can thrust at enemies that are three or four meters away, with Aegis seemingly getting rubber-banded to their location. In another instance, I stun-locked a miniboss with a series of heavy attacked which meant he never touched me at all. 

There are your traditional soulslike stats and weapon upgrades, though nothing particularly innovative apart from an overheat system that never really bothered me. What did bother me was the succession of drab, uninspired Parisian streets that made up most of the game, occasionally replaced by repetitive gardens and hedge mazes, all with the same gates, benches, and statues. This isn’t helped by the fact that a lot of the game inexplicably takes place at night. It’s such a shame because Paris itself is a wonderful place, and with a larger budget or a bit more imagination we could have had some vibrant, colourful locales similar to what the team developing Enotria The Last Song managed to pull off.

The story is intriguing enough, but gets a bit lost in its own convoluted lore, and despite including real historical figures like Robespierre, Necker, and Lafayette, is dolled out mostly during scenes where three of four NPC monologue at you until you are eventually sent off to complete another quest.

Lastly, I will touch briefly on the many bugs I encountered, three years after release, including several hard crashes, textures not loading in properly, or, perhaps the most annoying, a loss of focus after using a “vestal” bonfire which meant everything suddenly looked way too blurry. 

I was really disappointed with Steelrising, as its concept was so promising and other games such as Lies of P have shown how fun it can be to take cultural elements from our own history and change them in new and exciting ways.

You can't expect a masterpiece or even a very memorable experience, but it is a fun experience. If that's enough for you, then get this game. I played this game almost every day with my brother back in 2020-2023 on the PS5. I have over 600 hours on this game over there. I bought Fallout First all those years, though one of those was because I forgot to cancel the auto-renewal. Still, I enjoyed playing this game and completing the battle pass every season. There's plenty of content in this game now after all the updates to keep you engaged for as long as I was.

Here's probably something more important for most people: why I stopped playing Fallout 76 for a while. I believe the only reason I was able to play this game every day without getting tired was because of Fallout First. Like Elder Scrolls Online, the subscription gives you an unlimited stash amount that is required for long term enjoyment. Even though I didn't craft so many things to the point I needed all that space, it just cuts out a significant amount of frustration. There's already too much micromanagement and menuing in this game that I hate. Adding more by requiring me to stop playing and drop all my junk items and ammo so I can sprint again is astronomically stupid. I already spent more on this game than any other game I've ever played by paying for Fallout First for 3 years. That's $300 + $40 (PC version a few weeks after launch) + $10 (Xbox version a year after launch) = $350. I never buy microtransactions or subscriptions for any games. I play 100s of hours of Call of Duty and progress the battle pass, all without paying a dime. I can ignore $50 skins and $20 battle passes that only give emblems and calling cards with a couple double XP tokens mixed in. I don't excuse any of that nonsense, but I can enjoy the game with it. This game is an exception for me, and all the money I've paid isn't enough for them (the developers / publishers). I truly can't enjoy this game without Fallout First. I love scavenging and collecting things in the open world. Dropping them all the time makes it feel like a waste, and there's not enough storage space for non payers. The more I talk about the game's bad business practices, the less I want to recommend it, so I'll stop here. Just know that I could go on. I could go on and on and on...

This game is pretty great and should be an easy recommendation to anyone who just wants to play something with their brain off while they watch a video or chat with their friends. It provides a casual experience where there's always something to do, but you can stop whenever you want. The biggest flaw that completely drives me away is that the game doesn't want me to play unless I'm always paying. Other games provide a playable experience for the base price of purchasing the game, but not this one. If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time recommending this game without a massive caveat. Honestly, the only thing that got me into this game as much as I was was playing with my brother. I enjoyed so many experiences I had with this game in all the years it's been out, but I can't get that anymore without continuously paying. I'll pop back into this game occasionally to try new content, but it never holds me for long. It's just sad that it has to be this way. This game is capable of standing alongside the other live service juggernauts but holds itself back needlessly. 

I'm only writing this review because of the Steam Awards, but it really let me reflect on the kind of game this is. I have so much more I could say, I mean I probably have close to 1000 hours of playtime across Steam, PS5, and Xbox. I just don't think anyone will read this on a 7 year old game with over 40,000 reviews. I guess if what I said is interesting enough to others, I'll come back and write more, but I've already spent enough time writing what I have. I hope anyone reading this understands where I'm coming from with this review. I doubt I'll be changing anything in the games industry with this, but I just wanted to say what's on my mind. Games can be better. So much love, care, and passion is poured into these 100 million dollar projects that it's such a shame to take all that away for a quick extra buck. But I know nobody does anything for free, and money has to be made at some point. The truly talented people are able to place that barrier in appropriate spots. If I could take this game offline and play with mods, I would easily add 100s of more hours. As it is now, though, as it was designed... I'm just sad.",False,0,0,1764091152

In it's way, it's art. An absurd, weird, gross, horrific and original 3D first person rogue-like horror. First runs can feel senseless, but little by little most of the game world will make sense. The graphics are a little better than on the screenshots; nice art style; musics and audio effects are spot on. If you like the genre or the idea, you won't be disappointed. Prepare for a sick ride!

While working through my games backlog, I like to pace myself by playing one fairly ""normal"" game and following that up with something weird as hell. [b]Golden Light[/b] falls firmly in the latter category; however, what started as a very intriguing premise would turn out to be a bit of a disappointment.

In Golden Light, our unnamed protagonist descends into the depths of the Gut searching for She, his lost lady love. Here, the Gut serves as both the environment and the antagonist, becoming angrier and more hostile the more enemies you kill. And if you find it all too much to bear, you can always appease it by hurting yourself or making offerings…

From what I saw, the story in Golden Light closely follows the Silent Hill ""formula"" (or at least, what's been accepted as the Silent Hill Formula over the years): our protagonist is lost and trapped in a purgatory-like place, searching for a loved one. This fairly well-worn base is then topped with a generous smattering of meat and weirdness (with a sprinkle of Cronenberg and Lynch), giving Golden Light a unique and genuinely unsettling vibe.

Look, I'ma be real - I'm not a huge fan of games whose idea of horror is enemies barrelling down towards me, screaming bloody murder. And since this is basically Golden Light's main shtick, I think you'll understand why I dropped it so quickly.

If you're OK with constant, annoying jump scares, I think there's actually something to Golden Light. The meat aesthetic alone is unique enough to merit at least giving it a try, and for all I know, the story might go deeper than the surface-level stuff I saw would suggest.",False,2,0,1756381812

Moment to moment gameplay here is mostly scouring the floor you're in, looking for keys which will give you access to the next floor, while avoiding traps and enemies (and combat), and collecting resources that can all be used in multiple ways. Got a consumable? You can either eat it or throw it at enemies to trigger status effects. Got a new weapon? You can either use it (with very poor control and damage in general), throw it (for status effects) or eat it (?) as well. Managing these resources while deciding when to engage in combat is the core to the game, and it took me almost four hours to really understand it, since it's a very obtuse game (and unashamedly so).

So, if you want a run and gun game, this is not it. This is a much more cerebral and cautious kind of game. Buyer beware.

Outside of the 'dungeon floors' you have a hub world that is as weird as the levels, and even after beating the game I'm still confused as to how to navigate it. There's certainly a proper way, an optimal path, but I have absolutely no idea what it is.

Now, I didn't love the gameplay, and hence is why I wouldn't recommend the game. But one thing that it gets absolutely right are the vibes. Visual design, sound design, enemies, environments, loading screens and transitions, everything is super well alligned to the vibe the game wants to convey, and there's something really satisfying to see gel together.

Story-wise it was very generic, boring and isn't the strong suit of this game.

But the reason for the negative review is that the experience is sullied by the absolutely horrible port.
Before even starting the game, opening the settings in the launcher almost crashed my PC and caused the fans to go crazy.
So I never touched that again, but it continued inside the game in the form of massive frame drops and freezes even in cutscenes and also crashed multiple times.

On top of that I've encountered some of the most random bugs such as subtitles stop working on a specific mission, camera won't open on a mission where you need to take pictures or not being able to continue after solving a puzzle and having to restart the game.

Addendum: I already completed the game yesterday but they seem to have released a minor patch to fix a bug with button combinations today, though they still haven't touched the others I've seen which when I googled them I found out some still exist from the PS4 version release.

Either wait until this is heavily discounted or just pirate it.

- the 2nd highest selling PS4 game of all time: 
  -- especially how late during the console's life-cycle it was released
- Spider-Man 2 is the highest selling PS5 game of all time
I thought I would have nothing to lose getting it. I bought it via a CD key and took the risk; which excludes it from Steam's refund policy. 

But this goes to show, that, both mass critic and user reviews, cannot be relied upon as it is mostly generated hype and cult followings, favouring style over substance.

This game unfortunately falls into the generic Ubisoft sandbox. The map is huge, but there is little ways to interact with the world. The people walking around are nothing but cardboard NPCs, and the buildings are just blocks for you to swing off. There are no interiors and few unique charms that make exploring the city worth while. A denser, more alive open world with more content would have done this world favours.

The physics and controls are pretty tight. Spiderman has a varied move-set and the combat is somewhat similar to Batman Arkham series, where you have to perform timed dodges, deal with enemies wielding melee or ranged weapons, shields etc which means you have to spin a different combo to deal with them and not mash the same buttons. That part works, what doesn't is the overall game-loop. 

- the graphics are not that great, older titles like MGS Phantom Pain look far more stunning
- there is no day and night cycle or changes to weather - they do change based on story script only, so if you are just exploring, the world feels static, not dynamic.
- the side-quests are just generic activities:
  -- wave fights: (personally I think this is one of the lowest forms of gameplay, to program it you just need a simple loop of enemy respawns and triggered conditions). The particular waves in this game get very tiresome, it isn't a matter of skill, but endurance.
-- crimes: a bit better than endless waves, short and sweet, but nothing special. Vehicle chases means swinging after a vehicle, then pressing some Quick Time Events to watch a few animations.
  -- collectibles: backpacks, pidgeons etc. simply means gathering them. There isn't a skill based challenge or a gadget themed puzzle requiring you to get them. Reaching the pointer on the map and grabbing them is enough
  -- Ubisoft towers (really dated legacy mechanic most people are tired off, interact with a tower, reveal portion of the map)
  -- photographs landmarks (there are a few unique buildings, you just pull out the camera and snap a photo)
- full of mundane progression minigames - if anyone remembers Bioshock's Pipe-Dream hacking minigame, well this is back, but in the form of electric circuits. I never liked minigames, I just want to play the game, but when you have to repeat the same minigame over and over it gets stale and repetitive very quickly. In contrast to Arkham, those games require you use your gadgets to interact with your environment, where as here you find detached minigames that don't at all link to Spiderman or any of his tools. 
  -- Luckily, accessibility options do allow you to skip them entirely, which I did gladly.
- Skill trees: in the 2010s era every exclusive sandbox had to have the 3 skill trees: tap A to do this faster; take less damage;  something affects 1 more enemy etc. - quantitative checkbox updates rather than quality updates that affect how you interact with the world.
- enemy AI is not dynamic and reactive like in Arkham, they won't start destroying perch points once they see you them. They will behave in the same manner throughout
- The MJ and Miles sections are scripted, linear stealth sections. You cannot change how its done or pick your own route, you go from point to point as you're told and cannot deviate from this line.
- I don't know why so many devs obsessed with cinema do this, but if you want to explain a narrative, just add a cutscene. Instead you will be stopped with many sections that require forced walking, you walk around a room, and press the action button to interact with an object, the character speaks some monologue about what you saw, then you have to repeat this several times until you have interacted with enough objects/the correct object. Again, I just want to play the real game, save these interaction sequences for cutscenes, don't force me to hold ""up"" for 5 minutes pressing ""Y"" to move the game forward.

The pluses are:
+ lots of different suits, gadgets and suit mods to modify your play style
+ controls and physics feel tight
+ web slinging feels tight and controlled
+ map is large
+ lots of Marvel characters make an appearance

Overall I really find it hard to understand how this outsold, especially so much later in the console's lifecycle, much more dynamic and innovative titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and MGS Phantom Pain. The game mostly borrows all of its mechanics from other titles, but doesn't contribute anything innovative of its own.

My recommendation is to buy this from Steam directly, that way if you don't like it and played under 2 hours, you can refund it - this will give you ample time to test it, as what you see in those 2 hours is what you will get throughout. Or try to see if you can play a demo version. 

If you find yourself that you are not tired of generic open world games like Assassin's Creed and many other Ubisoft titles, then you can probably sink into this. But if you strive for quality and innovation, try the demo before buying (or buy directly from Steam, and request a refund in under 2 hours). To me a lot of this is very last gen, if it came out in 2012 it would have been top tier, but even Arkham City outclasses this game and has a more unique variety of activities in its sandbox, despite having a much smaller world. And that being said, I also think that most Ubisoft sandboxes are actually a lot more fun than this game, even AC Odyssey whose map is far too large and has literal fetch quests offers more thrills.",False,5,0,1762982330

	I've sunk over a thousand hours into 7 Days to Die over the years, a testament to how fantastic this game [b] used to be. [/b] The core concept of a voxel-based zombie survival crafting game is brilliant, and for a long time, it delivered some truly memorable experiences. The issue is that the game I fell in love with is not the game it is today, and the developers (""The Fun Pimps"") seem intent on a cycle of endless, often regressive, change rather than refinement.

	My lack of recommendation comes down to one core problem: the developers constantly redesign fundamental systems from the ground up with almost every major update. Instead of building on existing mechanics, they scrap them entirely, forcing veteran players to re-learn a ""new"" game every single time. This isn't early access refinement; it's a lack of vision.

    • [b] Scrapped Mechanics: [/b] We've seen multiple iterations of progression systems, from the ""learn by doing"" model to the current perk and magazine-based system. Each change feels like a sideways step, often removing depth and features that the community enjoyed (like empty jars or specific meat types) for no apparent reason other than change for change's sake.

    • [b] Forced Playstyles: [/b] Recent updates have introduced systems like biome progression tied to loot stages, which can feel linear and removes the open-world freedom that was a hallmark of earlier alphas. Base designs and creative building approaches that players developed over time are often patched out, forcing specific, developer-approved play styles.

    • [b] An ""Eternal Early Access"": [/b] After more than a decade in Early Access, the game still feels unpolished in many areas, while basic, long-promised features like bandits or robust NPC systems remain missing (though competently implemented by the modding community). The recent 1.0/2.0 updates have only amplified these frustrations, adding poorly implemented features like the annoying storm system that just waste time.
	
     I got my money's worth, absolutely. But I cannot recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state, nor can I endorse the development philosophy. If you are looking for a stable, long-term survival experience that consistently builds on its foundations, this isn't it. The game is a revolving door of concepts, and you never know when the mechanics you enjoy will be completely removed in the next patch. The modding community truly keeps this game alive; without them, it would have died a long time ago.",False,0,0,1764096211

One cutscene dumping a decade of Destiny lore in a minute is not really the play in terms of good story telling.

Additionally the vaulting of content is the dumbest thing ever. It's 2025 and they haven't figured out how to add content without needing to subtract content.

With ups and downs, when they launched The Final Shape, we tought they would come back and be what the players wanted. We were very wrong.

Destiny used to be a unique game. ""Planets"" to visit, amazing campaign, well written villains and characters in general. With some teaks here and there, some QoL changes (like Lfg, loadouts and subclasses 3.0), legendary campaign for the old ones (Red War, CoO, Wm and Forsaken) and also, some changes of bosses mechanics would make Destiny a desirable game to play. Now it's just menus and cards (Portal), content we paid for is gone for good, new locations are not that interesting and not worth visiting. When Destiny was ""not so good"", even Mercury were packed with players. 

Now i feel that i don't even need locations to go and that's one of the reasons that made me quit Destiny. You could just chill in IO, Titan, Mercury or Mars. You could chase the meta or just play the game the way you want. We had fun, now Bungie is a generic company.

I felt robbed when they sunsetted the content we paid for but i stuck cuz the narrative was good and we still had some uniqueness to the game. Now we don't.

Maybe i will come back one day and edit this, saying that they gave us back what we paid for, but i highly doubt and that just makes me sad, because i really miss the ""Journey"" that Destiny used to be (yeah, the feeling of the game and the best music they made)

If somehow they come back with what we deserve, i will be the first to be around. Until then, i will just reminisce on the good times i had and how used to be fun to just be playing Destiny outside the menus.",False,0,0,1764127564

Bungie should have walked away in 2020, while people were still applauding. But they insisted on milking it dry for profits and Pete Parsons very basic taste in classic cars.
I discovered Destiny in those years when Borderlands 2 had grown stale as yesterday's bread. And one boring day in school,  before me opened a pure greatness of game universe, that is a cathedral of a game design. A space western without tacky laser cowboys. Futuristic industrial design – sublime, functional, memorable – fused with magic that felt real and harked back to magic lore and mythology of our real world.
The first cracks on facade and mold in the basement appeared in Season 8. Patchnotes. ""Shake up the meta,"" they proclaimed, as if a hurricane in a china shop constitutes strategy. Massive damage nerfs to weapons and unique traits of armor.
Sunsetting... that was the moment when the roof caved in and walls began to bulge. They took our weapons – not just items, you see, but time made tangible. Hours of our lives, god rolls we treasured like family heirlooms... all discarded with a corporate smile about ""player experience.""
And then – slow rot. Content became faceless. Witch Queen briefly lit the old light in the windows, Final Shape reminded us what this building could have been... but the foundation was eaten through. No weapon felt meaningful. No activity – irreplaceable. Class building? A lick of a fresh paint on a bumpy hardwood floor and a new layer of a plaster on a bulged walls, that was carried out for too long, and amounted in too little result.
In 2018-2020 they gave us a cathedral. Magnificent. Singular. Then they buried that potential under layers of corporate incompetence and the paranoid fear of giving players too much.

game's story is good, combat and raids are amazing(which is why i played for as long as i did) but new player onboarding experience is non existent. you either need to have friends already playing the game at the high item levels or grind infinite(playing multiple rosters from multiple steam accounts and funneling resources to your main roster and bussing) or pay up infinite. if you don't have or can't do any of those 3 don't even bother installing if you're looking forward to the end game content, its legit unplayable.

The game is also full of quest bloat, which quickly becomes very tedious. The game would improve drastically if it wasn't full to the brim with ""I need you to deliver a pointless message to the person I'm standing right next to"" tasks.

The biggest grind of all is the walled content. The game lacks so many fundamentals that make an MMO great, such as sub-stat grinding and general farming. We all play them for the grind, the grind is a necessary characteristic of an MMO, but everything from farming to raiding is limited to a laughable daily/weekly limit which can only be alleviated by climbing over the paywall in one form or another. Even the bare basics, such as mining, logging, fishing, etc. is placed behind a cap... in an MMO. That's like playing Among Us, and the game says ""I'm sorry, you've completed too many tasks. Head to the store if you wish to continue."" There is no grind, only hinderance.

This WOULD be the greatest turn-based rpg I have EVER played.

WOULD. The truth though, is that this game stutters so badly and so frequently it is practically unplayable in Acts 2 and 3. Your game is going to be a little bit choppy in Act 1, worse in populated areas; you'll forgive it, because you're enjoying the story and game so much. Then Act 2 will come, and it will get worse. Cutscenes are now a choppy mess, character dialogue is constantly glitching out, so you're constantly pulled out of immersion. But you're invested at this point, so you sludge through the glitchiness to Act 3.

Then when your refund-window is LONG expired, and you're coming out of Act 2 finally on your way to Baldurs gate, and the truly performance-intensive areas are finally here... oh boy, it is bad. Non-stop stuttering, there is not one spoken word that isn't choppy, and the game truly becomes unplayable. I cannot believe a GOTY game performs like this.

The perforance is.. sad, the game struggles even on an RTX 3060 around medium settings at 1080p.

The file size is so overly bloated, it's rediclous.

Sometimes the world will take forever to properly load in(as in you can sometimes walk right out of the game world, or into an otherwise unnavagatable spot(like inside a boulder)).

Has terrible camera controls for vertical spaces.

Almost all the team mates are entirely unlikeable(I realise this is probably just a me thing).

Compared to other D&D games the character building is, just sad, it's been gutted so badly.

Level cap of 12, tells me it's unfinished.

A lot of spells and abilities even in those 12 levels worth are just missing.

One adult scene in particular(that you do have to go well out of your way for, and get plenty of warning, along with multiple chances to back out) isn't even legal in the US(thankfully I don't live there, but still worth mentioning)

Has a good number of missable quests,(as an example:  oh, you needed a rest, well too bad, this quest in a zone you haven't even gotten to yet failed, the child is dead, with nothing you can do about it other then start the whole game over) 

Mod implimentation is... bad... they should have just done the normal thing instead of, well, what they went with, Nexus may not be the most friendly of places, but it works properly far more often.

As I started with, it's probably not a bad game, but it's not a worthy sequal to Baulder's Gate II, the shift to turn based was a great idea, but the rest of it feels half baked in comparison.  I may get around to actually playing through what they bothered to make here someday, but for now, the file space is more valuable elsewhere used for programs that run at a decent rate.

You have missed the hype and most likely have already seen all of the spoilers. Either way, this game is better to watch anyway since the devs haven't updated the game since 2023 and that update was for the addition of MacOS players being able to play the game. I have a small feeling that the devs have abandoned this game which is sad since there are certain achievements that are now impossible to get due to certain areas having bugs where you simply either get soft-locked trying to enter them or can't enter them without somehow debugging if that is even possible (I'll get into those bugs later in this review). 

My personal opinion of this game is that it is amazing, it still seems to have an active community, it is cute as all hell and even funny at some parts, and the puzzles and story and interactions with the individual robots is just awesome. I love cats too :3

Anyway now, about the bugs: There is this weird bug in the game that affects three achievements. Those achievements being (from what I believe): Territory, Badges, and I Remember. The bug is where you just get stuck on certain parts of big pipes that you either walk on or through. I've had it to where it completely traps the character you play as forcing me to reload my save and I've had it to where it just blocks the character you play from progressing entirely.

If this game stopped being a roguelite, this would be so much better game. If either:
1) It added a checkpoint system every few levels so you don't have to start from the beginning again.
or, 2) It got rid of all upgrades and unlocked all abilites and weapons from the very start and ending this game was purely based on skill.

Either one of those and I would be actually playing the game to the end because it's such a cool game to play with especially on a handheld. In the current state I can only recommend it if you get someone's save file or a mod that does either of the above two things, otherwise I don't recommend any roguelite and that includes this game.

Roguelites have blown up in popularity but people have forgot how little dopamine hits every now and then can be really addicting and can really suck you in and just feels like you're progressing or having fun while inside your head, you're just agitated, nervous and fucking terrifed of dying in a video game.",False,1,1,1764040203
Hades,1145360,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561197997838861,"Let's preface this simply by saying, I enjoyed my first 50 hours with this game. Interesting character dynamics, fun varied combat, challenging but satisfying combat, all around I enjoyed nearly all of that 50 hours; But you wanna know why I have an extra 30 hours? 

Achievement hunting, specifically ONE Achievement. Now, I'll be the bigger man and won't spoil what it was, but I'll explain a bit about this game's rouge-like element. Each of the games zones are made out of rooms. Combat, challenges, survive etc. There's a particular type of room called Encounter Rooms. They often give great benefits. Issue is, they're also bloody rare. You can go 10-20 runs without seeing one. To get 3 achievements, you need to find each of the 3 zones encounter rooms and that's not all. Some of these achievements can only be done AFTER finishing the prior one so if you low-ball cant get a certain encounter in a previous zone, you're SOOL for a while. 

Worse part is, you can customize the difficulty of your runs, you can make Zagreus stronger or weaker as you see fit, but all that pales to the sheer fact you cant control Encounter Rooms. It's literal RNG baked into the game. So you really can't cheese this outside letting the mobs kill you after wasting 15 minutes into a run.

Overall, Great game but the encounter rooms made it overstay its welcome. Won't immediately try out Hades 2 now its fully released But I hope they did fix this of all things.

If you have experience in roguelikes, you will probably NOT enjoy it. Don't buy it just because of the hype (it's a mystery).

Hades really puts the LITE in roguelite.

The art is great. It's the best part for me.

The story is... I don't know, I didn't finish it. Lore is given in tiny bits of dialogue after each run. While it's nice to have a lot of voiced lines, it's just too much filler. From what I've seen, there's not much intrigue either.

Gameplay gets boring after several hours. There are fixed room layouts with the same enemies, very little gameplay variation. The most you can do is try different builds, but they all function mostly the same (basic button mashing).
After completing one almost-full run, I just couldn't force myself to do it again. And from what I've heard, you have to do 10+ complete runs just to get the full story.

Honestly, I'm sick of everyone talking about roguelikes. It's my favourite game genre and Hades is kinda giving it a bad name.

It is a roguelite, so by nature it is grindy. Although in theory you can beat it at the first try, most players will play dozens of runs before beating the final boss and they will repeat even more for true endings, and unlockables.

However, Hades differences between runs feel  fairly minor. Updates are boring,  most of them are small improvements in health or damage,  poison vs critical damage, etc. Enemies feel to have too much life and need  plenty of button mashing. And unlock new things takes too many runs.

But! you may be thinking, didn't they patch it? Surely it's all fixed now right, why the hate?

To which I direct you to take-two's EULA for not just this game, but everything they have a hand in. Even in absentia of the horrific anti-consumer practices that gearbox themselves are guilty of going back as far as them embezzling funding from SEGA to use on their own projects, if you look at the EULA that Take-Two is now making mandatory on virtually all of their games you will find that they have declared for themselves the rights to access and collect the following information:

-Your name
-Your Email
-Your phone number
-Your photo
-Your mailing address/zip code
-payment or purchase info
-age

Furthermore, they also ""share"" (read:sell), your information with the following:

-Vendors that perform services and support for them

I realize that I'm going to most assuredly get flamed for daring to mention these things, likely by a bunch of addict lobotomites who are perfectly willing to sell their privacy, and any dignity or self-respect under the auspices that no one will actually come to collect on them personally, but as someone who purchased this game and played it for ages long before the IP was unceremoniously sold off and gutted by a company I despise due to their long history of abusing their customers, I cannot overstate how much I despise this entire series of events.

And yes, the truth is we're all trapped in this awful market environment, run roughshod over by corporate interests and information brokering thieves, but to have it so blatantly done to a game I loved, and considered one of the best in the genre? To see it literally become unplayable in a proper state for a year before they actually fixed things, and have everything unique and fun about it be dragged out and abused for all it's worth by unscrupulous corporate asshairs who couldn't give a shit less about something that was until that point, crowd funded and beloved by its community? It's like purchasing a car and then a decade later the company changes hands and they break into your house and reengineer every part of your vehicle to function worse so they can sell you back the parts they just stole from you. We aren't renters, we are owners of these things, at least we damn well should be for the amount of money we pay for these products. Enough is enough.

I cannot, and will not support this, and I say if you have any respect for yourself or what this game was before they infested it, cut them off. Let something new take its place someday, and God willing let that indie dev not decide to sell out their baby to the devil.",False,1,0,1764143256

From the very first run, the game hooks you with its fast-paced movement, responsive controls, and endless surprises around every corner. Every level feels alive, challenging, and meticulously crafted, keeping you on your toes while rewarding skill and experimentation.

Combat is both satisfying and strategic. Whether you’re slashing with swords, raining arrows from a distance, or experimenting with magical abilities, every encounter demands quick thinking and adaptability. The variety of weapons, abilities, and power-ups ensures no two runs feel the same, making every death feel like a learning experience rather than a setback.

The procedural levels are beautifully designed, blending consistency with unpredictability. You’ll explore sprawling castles, perilous biomes, and hidden areas, all teeming with enemies, secrets, and loot. Each run is a fresh challenge, keeping the game endlessly replayable.

Progression is rewarding and fair. Unlocking new weapons, mutations, and abilities encourages experimentation and creates a sense of growth across multiple runs. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and satisfaction, making every victory feel earned.

Visually, Dead Cells is stunning. Pixel art meets fluid animation in a style that’s both retro and modern. Coupled with an energetic soundtrack, the game’s atmosphere feels tense, vibrant, and utterly alive.

Final Verdict:
Dead Cells is a thrilling roguelike that combines fluid combat, clever design, and endless replayability. Challenging, rewarding, and endlessly fun, it’s a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed platformers and roguelikes.

It is a Rogue game. If you are someone that likes making progress in your games, values a story or actually progressing while playing, look the other way. This genre is terrible if any of the above things matter to you at all.

I'm not sure what it is, I don't understand why, but I feel like this game gets tons of praise that I just don't get. I won't deny visually the game is definitely pretty to look at, but it doesn't really stand out much to me. Not much in this game stands out to me. Tons of cosmetics, tons of weapons, tons of utilities, tons of unlocks, tons of additional things you can get too like bombs or traps; it almost feels, dare I say, bloated. To me personally. But I wonder, why do I love having a ton of unlocks in games like Tboi or Ror2, but with this game I don't care for some reason? I think there may just be something in the core of this game that I don't like.

Some things I just straight up don't like: Level progression. This game's progression across levels feels so, so painfully muddled, and nonlinear. This could be something that very well might be fixed after playing the game for long enough, but dude, it's been 29, almost 30 hours of playtime as of right now. Why do I still not understand how I'm getting to like 70% of the levels I'm in. You start at level 1, then there's the two different level 2's, and then around each of those there's like 5 more levels that, I'm gonna be real, I can't even tell if they're actual main levels or just alternate areas. What the fuck is happening. I've probably been to like 10 different areas in the game so far. If you put a million dollars on the line, and put me in 7 of those areas and asked me ""Where are you in the game right now?"", I still could not give you a straight answer. It's just very needlessly over complicated.

I never cared too much for the combat either. I try to block enemies, but parry timing doesn't feel right that often. This could very well be a me thing but combat just feels very clunky, ESPECIALLY in the later levels when there's more enemies that have more complex and unpredictable attacks that are additionally sometimes stacked on top of each other. It's not the type of thing where enemies take turns either, shit will just attack you and that makes parrying so much harder. On top of this at the end of each level you have one mutation to pick, from a list of like 50+. It's just numbers. It's just a bunch of numbers, more damage when you do this, blocking does this, this ranged stuff is a little better, nothing stands out. It just all feels so lame and not unique or impactful enough at all. That's how a lot of stuff in this game feels for me, just a lot of Quantity > Quality, honestly.

If it sounds like I'm hating just to hate, I definitely get that don't get me wrong, but believe me, I'm not. I am STILL, from time and time again, coming back to this game and playing it for a bit, just to see if something sticks. As of right now though nothing has really grabbed my attention too much from this game. Nothing specific from it has made me truly yearn to come back to it, like a really cool weapon or gimmick or something. I'm just trying to find SOMETHING here, okay? I'm really trying, I promise. I see this game get a lot of positive reception, I want to understand it. This game's probably a better metroidvania than a roguelite honestly, and if that's your jam then that's awesome, dude. I may just not be that big of a fan of metroidvanias. As a big roguelite guy I wouldn't personally recommend it but that's just from my own personal taste.

This is stupid but I have to add this: Guys. This is the year 2025, and we STILL don't have options for adjusting the graphics in our game? Are we actually serious? This game just started running terribly for me as I've been trying to play it again now, with the same computer and everything, and I can't change fps or graphics or anything. I forgot but, I guess it is hard to advance past the prestigious, high-end computer technology of the late 90's. That is fucking INSANE, just ridiculous.

Maybe a bit overhyped. 
_________________

Main issue: 
even with lot of stuff to unlock the runs don´t feel like you are making progress at all or you make a real impact. 

You have like 3 classes which make different items /skills better - but there is less difference.
I mean c´mon, who cares if your turret shoots flames, canonballs or arrows. 
Same to e.g. swords, daggers - they just have like 3 attack patterns while hitting the smash button. 
You can hook, you can kick - that´s almost the highlights here. 

Don´t get me wrong: You CAN parry with a shield. There is variety (ice bow, explosions,...). But you carry (mostly) 2 weapons, 2 skills. And you will exchange them, due to ""level"" of items. Use & exchange w/ new one.
I´d have liked a ""upgrade your character"" thing, to really create a lasting build. 

You have 3 ""passive options"" to choose per run. To really make a difference this restriction is pain. 
Compare binding of isaac - you got tons of passive items, which also stack. Not here.
So don´t expect really awesome combos...

Bosses will get repetitive. Yes they get stronger and have different move sets while you make progress - they still feel the same. 
Maybe this is also because of the plain story... There is also no real benefit they provide for the run while defeating them. 

There is lot to like: in my case especially the art style, humor and references to other games.
But I was expecting something different.

The intro were so effing long I had to go into the game folder and delete those darn three videos and you should do the same if you don't want to spent an hour long watching that shjt when you first start the game.

Slow pace, so much walking. There are literally 10 more badass soldier on the train and I have to do all the work for them, alone, make no sense. And my chick and her sugar daddy keep yelling at each other all the time.

NPCs talk a lot and continuously, and argue endlessly, one person hasn't finished speaking yet and the other has already jumped in and yelling. The English dub is really bad, cringe and tense with a weird accent, I had to switch to Russian dub to listen to it less annoying.

Annoying buzzing sound (on my watch I guess) really drive me crazy!! WTF what that? Idk if it is a bug/glitch or game's feature but I can not stand it any second. F that sheat!

One thing that seemed really cool at first but turned out to be really ridiculous was the sound effects, for example when an NPC was talking, I was standing right in front of them but when I turned the camera left/right/behind I couldn't hear them anymore, it was funny and ridiculous.

The requirements for a perfect clearing of the levels fail to trigger making a perfect game a crap shoot; you fail stealth sections without any alerted enemies

every weapon you get sucks and the level clear penalty for your material makes upgrading weapons a chore

the exploration is as shallow as can be and literally crap compared to shovelware like ""mad max"" (mad max is a bad game but at least it DOESNT PENALIZE YOU FOR THE SCRAP YOU COLLECT EVERY TIME YOU CLEAR A REGION FOR ""REPAIRS"")

The enemies are bullet sponges and playing on any difficulty higher than normal is just garbage. they shoot you from across the map in fog you cant see through then take several shots to the hear AFTER THEIR HELMET AND MASK FLY OFF

I dont remember this game sucking that bad at launch and didnt review it but holy crap i cant recommend this game at all. just read the books, its sad that all of the metro games suck but they changes this to play more like stalker. like i seriously just want to wander in the wastes and collect trinkets and shoot the occasional skag/hostile scavenger, this is all just artificially difficult to pad out playtime. i remember how short this crap is and on my current playthrough i havent even stolen the strain yet and ive died 30+ times. 

Do not buy this game and if you do play it on normal bc its just trying to pass the 2 hour refund deadline; NOTHING you do in the rest of the game minus that stupid gas filled tunnel on the third map are as hard as this horrible intro. like they have seriously made the intro as bad as atomic hearts for some reason.

Lethal Company throws players into a darkly comedic sci-fi world where you and your crew of unfortunate contractors are sent to abandoned industrial moons to salvage scrap for a ruthless megacorporation. What starts as a simple job quickly spirals into a tense, unpredictable experience as every mission risks becoming your last.

The game shines in its cooperative gameplay and emergent chaos. Working together to explore derelict facilities, avoid traps, and carry loot back to the ship creates constant tension—especially when creatures begin stalking the halls. Communication, quick thinking, and teamwork determine whether you escape alive or become yet another “unfortunate loss” on the company ledger.

The progression loop is simple but addictive. Collect scrap, sell it, buy better gear, and take on more dangerous environments. Each moon offers unique layouts, hazards, and threats, making every run feel fresh. The randomness of enemy encounters and environmental quirks adds to the thrill and unpredictability.

Atmosphere is one of the game’s biggest strengths. The dim lighting, eerie soundscapes, and unsettling creature designs create an environment that’s equal parts scary and hilarious—especially when panic sets in and everything falls apart. The blend of horror and humor gives the game a unique charm that keeps players coming back.

Final Verdict:
Lethal Company delivers a perfect mix of tension, teamwork, and unpredictable fun. Whether you're playing seriously or embracing the chaos, it’s an endlessly entertaining co-op experience filled with memorable moments and dark humor.

“Terrifying, chaotic, and ridiculously fun—clock in, survive, and hope the Company approves.”

HELLDIVERS 2,553850,31.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198108256612,"As a massive fan of the original game, I do not like the sequel. It feels like less of a co-op game and more of a ""everyone split up and do their own thing"" kind of game because the game is designed in ways that punish you for wanting to stay together with your teammates so it just feels heavily discouraged. Enemy spawns struggle to split between 4 players in different parts of the map so it results in the hardest difficulty feeling hilariously easy at times when one or more people barely get any spawns and just freely do objectives, but if you stay together you all get all the enemies spawns pretty much all the time which just ends up wasting so much time.

Helldivers 1 was built, designed, and balanced a lot around co-op centric things, your team had far more reason to have different roles and loadouts instead of making a strong versatile build that can do everything independently, team reload mechanic was a much stronger and encouraged mechanic, and the team was not allowed to be separated.

A lot of strategems and weapons also just feel worse than the HD1 counterparts in terms of damage, ammo economy, and general effectiveness. The standard Breaker shotgun and the Kinetic Shield are some of the worst offenders to me.

HD2 also lacks some crucial teamwork focused strategems that people like me desperately want back, such as the Rep-80 heal beam gun, or the Angel Guard dog medical backpack. The stim pistol was not a fun addition to the game as trying to hit people with that is insufferable, I don't care if people say it's skill issue, it is not fun, and not like it's very effective anyway cause players tend to die faster than it can heal anyway.

Player survivability in HD2 also just does not feel as fair or as fun as HD1 too. The incap system was completely removed so you just outright die (Gives another less incentive to use SMG's compared to HD1, hell you can't even carry artillery shells with one hand and shoot a one handed weapon at the same time anymore either), and weak enemies can even kill you in just a mere few hits sometimes. The games survivability relying so much on stims is not particularly a design choice I like either. I wish they kept the incap system and players being a bit tankier, and you had very very slow health regen instead if you arn't taking damage. (Stims should of been something in the grenade slot instead to replace grenades in my opinion.)

I don't like how armor went from a cosmetic only thing in HD1 so you could wear what you want and select the perk you wanted separately, to now armor passives have to be handcuffed to armors that I don't want to wear while the ones I want to wear have awful passives or ones I really don't want to use cause it won't complement my build. Which is rather annoying.

Performance and game stability is also not particularly great either. This game used to run well on my system early on but after a bunch of updates it feels like it really struggles to be stable, I know they started trying to address this though it's still not anywhere near how well the game used to run yet. (I acknowledge more major engine tech stuff may take time, but felt I'd mention this.)

I donno, maybe it's a hot take, but I do not like this game because it took away the biggest thing I praised the original for and that's feeling like a true co-op designed experience first and foremost, where lone wolf gameplay was actively discouraged. I don't like some of the other design decisions/changes too. I'd only recommend this game if you are okay with it being nothing like the original game, the game itself isn't terrible, but as an original fan it feels too alienating for me, like it was catoring to a completely different audience for the sake of being mainstream. 

There's a lot more I'm probably forgetting off the top of my head right now, so I'll end it with this. TLDR: I wish this game just tried to be more like HD1 in almost all aspects but with the third person perspective change and with more content/features, not drastically change or redesign things that worked just fine before.",False,2,0,1764159083

Playing with my friends was a blast as we tried many different combinations and weapons to tackle bugs, bots, and otherwise. While the game was fun in the beginning, the game now feels like a slog or chore. The personal secondary objectives to get medals used to be ""Use X gun for Y kills"" or ""Use an airstrike or sentry gun for Y kills."" Now it's always ""Collect samples"" or ""Evac 3 times from a faction-specific map."" The major orders follow suit with them just being ""Hold planet Z because why not?""

The samples I've collected have been in my inventory for over a year now; having upgraded my personal ship to the maximum, I don't think there will be any personal ship upgrades in the future or at all. 

The enemies are slanted towards the bugs last time I played, with them having numerous updates/upgrades from invisibility to flying acid dragons and fog-spewing chargers, while the bots do have different types of the flamethrower variety. It would be pretty cool if they had ships dispersing fog or invisible patrols or had fighting styles like the Illuminate.

The scope of the game has stretched it so thin, and despite some amazing work from the art team, including the sweet OST by Donglekumquat, it wastes so much of its effort on creating games that are destined to go unplayed, or forever be half-baked.

For a social game, Tower Unite is really bad at incentivising being social, and that is no more apparent than in the highly popular casino, where about half the lobby will be pressing their space bar for hours on end at the slots, while the adjacent poker hall, a game perfect for social interactions with strangers, sits empty. The Arcade is full of minigames, yet only a handful of the 20+ are even multiplayer, and the ones that really payout are once again just mindnumbingly pressing the space bar for hours on end. 
The game's poor balancing of rewards can encourage players to be antisocial.

Tower Unite is capable of putting out genuinely great games, I would still hold its Minigolf as one of the best out there, and you can easily lose yourself in its condo system for hours with how much possibility it has, but so much of its development has gone towards things that are pointless, games that are buggy, unbalanced, or simply lack the demand. 

A social game doesn't demand a weak quake imitator requiring years of development when most of its other features are still incomplete.

Don't support this game's echo chamber and hive mind/mob mentality. 
Initially starting out on this game I was impressed by the creative capabilities with condos and the amount of activities you could do with friends, so much so that I purchased one of the supporter packs. I'm a pretty reserved person so I don't speak up too often but after playing for a while in the plaza with my friends I began to notice the same kinds of people coming on making inflammatory statements, sexual comments, and just downright degeneracy. Then you look at their Steam profiles and see that many of those who frequent this game are SEVERELY detached from society, mentally unwell, and/or promote unhealthy things (like ""consensual"" sexual content with those who are underage). They seem to go by a ""we don't take care of things unless they're reported"" mentality unless you're speaking out against their hypocrisy, THAT is when you get some kind of ban as I have seen and heard of from many players, friend and not. They claim to defend against things like bigotry and certain figures so they can use those things as a blanket statement to silence what they don't agree with. I had a friend having a proper cordial discussion with a trans individual about how we should help take care of the trans community's mental health when they're young instead of just thrusting them onto HRT when someone came up and started harassing my friend, yelling over them, making load noises with items, and acting like my friend was being transphobic (they certainly are not and stated such several times). Evidently, after those 2 individuals went off to ""chat"" my friend was banned the very next day for HARASSING after never receiving so much as a warning prior to this. I can go into even more detail on other instances of inappropriate moderation but this review is already long enough and I'm honestly done with this game.",False,34,3,1760948030

There's multiple reports of CSAM/CP in condos (in reviews on Steam here, and claims/reports of users encountering it) and it has also been reported to Valve to delist the game. 
For asking what will be done regarding this problem since there's multiple reports (on Steam reviews & others spoken with); me & others get permanetely voice/text banned in game and within the social media such as discord.

This is not how you moderate your own product. If you do not have enough staff to moderate it, that is the companies fault for not being prepared and or properly staffed. It is a similar situation as to what's happening with Roblox for harboring predators as they have been taken to court for similar/same reasons.
There are minors that play this game at times, if you can't have the proper moderation for your product when there's reports of CP, it needs to shut down & or you need to have many more moderators, especially in game. It may be said they take this seriously, but yet it's a problem that keeps happening when it shouldn't as people still report this as a serious problem.
There should not be a single claim and or report of any predators on the platform. That is the fault of the company. In this case PixelTail, who should know better. I did not know how much of a problem this game had until only recently, when I first started playing this game a few years ago I did not know about these serious problems. The developers are their own moderators from what I read, which is not enough. They need an active moderation team in game and on the socials.
It is very strange that the community itself treats this as a joke, marking this review as funny. That's not normal and it only makes PixelTail look worse. That raises suspicions. only ones who would joke about a serious issue like this, may be predators themselves. Other games like vrchat are part of this problem too (which they've been notified with evidence multiple times by users). Some people need to have common sense as well, just because you have not seen something doesn't mean it doesn't happen. There's multiple reports of these problems by users for a reason.

I love this game and I love the interactions and conversations I've had through it. Do I recommend this game? No. Do I regret buying it, and the supporter packs? No. I have not and do not support Pixeltail through their Patreon. [strike]I will probably continue playing it since I have friends I introduced to it and I do enjoy condo building.[/strike] After having thought about it for a while, I won't be. There's no fixing this.[/b]

[h1]Gaming Time[/h1]

I think this game is horribly mismanaged. I'm not a game dev, I don't have any experience managing a company or studio. I also don't believe that any dev should take their community suggestions one to one and implement them full stop, it's their game and I respect that, but this game doesn't respect your time. I play all sorts of games, and I enjoy a good grind. In a game like Tower Unite, isn't the focus suppose to be on hanging out with people and making memories?

If you don't know, as it is with the current Halloween event you get a coin every 5 minutes, if you're actively playing a game that's not in the Casino or Condo- you must be the Plaza playing an plaza minigame, the Arcade, one of the game worlds (these are rewarded upon completion, so example, 5 days of Zombie Massacre + Boss) or you can earn them through Fishing, which isn't on a timer but is a percentage chance to drop. The best way to grind these are by Fishing and playing one game every 5 minutes. You can get coins from other activities, such as the Remains or Trick or Treat buckets, but those are also a percentage chance and on their own event timers.

If you want one Potted Carnivorous Plant, it costs 25 Ghoul Coins, which is 125 minutes, or 2 hours, spent so long as you're actively getting coins every 5 minutes exactly. This doesn't take into consideration that as of writing the backend for rewarding coins and other drops is bugged and the timer can be skewed. That is one copy of this condo item, and you cannot duplicate it without having multiple. Going off someone else's math, which has been consistent for the past 6 years I have played this game, if you want to buy one of everything, you'll need 328 coins or a minimum of 27 hours of just coin grinding. But we'll be fair and say you don't want or need everything, not everyone does.

Thing is, this is not just a holiday event issue. Usually you think of holidays as fun and rewarding, a distraction for people to get together and celebrate, but this is how the game is normally. Zombie Massacre, considering that you're playing solo and the meta, will take 15-20 minutes to earn roughly 30k units based on performance. If I go to the Casino and I play the horse betting game called Silver Saddles, I can bet 100k and make a minimum profit of that same 30k in what, 3-5 minutes tops? That's on the low end, a minimum total of 130k every game. This is considered an exploit. If you're an active condo builder who likes building with detail, 1 mil units is a drop in the bucket. Everything in Tower Unite has and will be funneled to the condo, unless you treat it like a party game to occasionally play with friends, which is perfectly fine too. Problem is, it is treated and advertised as the latter when the game is built with the former in mind, and not equally.

[h1]Social Hour[/h1]

A lot of people have and will continue to (rightfully) complain about the community. Yes, you have a wide breadth of people from all kinds of creeds and origins that will join a social game. Why anyone is suprised by that is beyond me, an individuals actions is what should be judged, not the individual or a generalized group. My problem comes with the fact that moderation in Tower Unite is negligble at best, straight up absent at it's worse. I'm also of the belief that a more laxed approach should be taken, and more users should use the Ignore/Mute and Block options that exists in games. Does that mean I am okay with the slurs, bigotry, harassment, and many other vile hatred statements that are spewed in this game? No. I just think for the most part that a lot of arguments can be handled like adults and most, including myself, are quick to anger and hatred.

Recently, there has been someone with an extensive track record of getting muted and banned for all sorts of reasons spamming a Discord link in the Global chat which can be seen by everyone in plazas, minigames, and condos as well as the main menu. Normally that's just a rule break, no advertising and solicitation? My problem with it is that it was a Discord link being advertised with another url that leads to a website advertising said Discord which has a focus on NSFW/Porn/Adult themes and sharing. Am I some sort of pearl clutching prude who hates the idea of adults enjoying themselves? No. Take one look at my profile. My problem is that it was being advertised in the Global chat and that person only got a 24 hour text chat ban, in a game that is not explicitly for adults, that allows children, teenagers, and vulnernable adults amongst each other. Some might mention the existence of Mature condos that feature similar imagery and chatting, but you need to explicitly turn on a setting to view those and it is not enabled by default. Global chat is on by default. Take Roblox as a better example of this kind of behavior and where it's getting them.

I'm not asking for the devs who are also the moderation team to be awake 24/7 and constantly monitoring the chat, nor am I asking for them to setup some kind of age verification or AI chat tool that'll constantly scan the chat. My solution? Get a moderation team. Problem with it? It's been asked and people have actively stepped up to say they will be a moderator. This and along with repeated harassment reports is completely normal behavior for most. This game doesn't have thousands of players, you see the same faces. The punishment does not fit the crime.

That is one incident that I didn't even fully cover, there are plenty of others, its an iceberg. And before I get asked ""did you report"", yes, I have reported people. Problem is, despite reporting, should I rely on a report, which might not be seen for several hours, for someone advertising adult servers, someone else doxxing, another hosting CSAM content? Why isn't there an active moderation team for a game thats active at all hours and allow you to run free?

[h1]More Questions[/h1]

I'm not someone who underestimates the time and patience it takes to not only develop a game, especially with the scope and scale that this game has. I have defended Pixeltail in the past, just like I have defended other games and studios, when I think they deserve it. I don't expect updates to come weekly, I don't expect anyone on to cater to me or anyone else. I also can't say I don't hesitate to make suggestions I know will be ignored. I'm not going to villainize Pixeltail.

It still does put into question why 1.0 released as rushed as it did. Why the Cats and Dogs update had a pack of dogs from an asset store, that wasn't even the full package, but one you can get through a pirated direct download. Why do you still need to spend so many hours to buy one silly little background for your profile that will only ever been seen by someone opening the scoreboard. Why there is so much going against you trying to have fun, from the backend that keeps track of of your inventory being bugged, to the chugging of servers past at 32/64 players, why an ingame Casino is more worth your time grinding than playing a game with your friends. Why are so many people allowed to get away with a slap on the wrist for such disgusting words and actions?

I was not a GMT (Garrys Mod Tower/GM Tower) player. I'm only speaking on recent feelings as of this year and the past few I've played. There is an extensive enough history not only in these reviews but their forums, from people who have spent a lot more time in game and are way smarter than me.

Spent a lot time building in this game, that was pretty fun, built a town and set up all kinds of contraptions, personally wasn't interested in much else the game had to offer as I could always find a better alternative on the steam marketplace. the concept is cool, and the devs are just doing their thing so I wouldn't really throw them under the bus or anything.  I can see why people really enjoy this game but after spending a couple hundred hours, I have found myself exhausted with what the game has to offer and perhaps a bit disenchanted.  I personally wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, there are better alternatives out there.  (trying my best not to flame and be straightforward with this)  EDIT: also, like many many people have stated there is a serious issue of user shared content in this game,I won't single anyone out or throw any groups of people under the bus but you should know anyone can post whatever they want and so as long as you simply state ""18+"" you are able to get away with sharing some pretty wicked stuff. so that feature comes with all the pros and cons of being able to share content in a public space, it's moderated yeah, but many things slip between the cracks like all public forums. The team will say they do their best to moderate but you will usually still find something totally shocking and it's usually on you for agreeing to enter an 18+ condo in the first place, which is just kind of a funny rule that is constantly bent.  Again, I suppose these are the things that come with entering a public forum but it still is worth noting that you will eventually run into some pretty far out stuff.)",False,12,0,1758635340

By shifting to a first-person perspective, the game plunges players directly into the claustrophobic and unsettling world of the Baker family, delivering an intensity and immersion rarely seen in horror games.

The atmosphere is pitch-perfect: every creaking floorboard, shadowy hallway, and grotesque detail contributes to a constant sense of dread. The game’s visuals and sound design are exceptional, combining to make even familiar settings feel deeply menacing.

Gameplay emphasizes survival and careful strategy. Ammo and resources are scarce, forcing players to think before they act and heightening the tension of every encounter. Puzzles and exploration are intelligently designed, rewarding curiosity while maintaining a constant sense of vulnerability.

The story is gripping and horrifying, blending psychological terror with body horror in a way that feels fresh yet unmistakably Resident Evil. The Baker family, particularly Jack Baker, are unforgettable antagonists whose presence keeps players on edge throughout.

Overall, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard revitalizes the franchise with a terrifying, immersive experience that balances horror, story, and gameplay flawlessly. It’s a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers seeking a true survival horror thrill.

I didn’t walk into that house to be a hero.
I just wanted her back.
That was my first mistake.

Nothing prepares you for the Bakers. No horror movie, no nightmare, no childhood fear. They don’t just attack you — they claim you. Jack speaks to you like you’re already family. Marguerite feeds you like she wants you to rot properly. Lucas watches you break and laughs because he knows he’s already won.

Every time I healed, the pain returned differently.
Every time I lost part of myself, something else grew in its place.
The house learned me.
Room by room. Breath by breath.

And the worst part? A part of me understood it. The mold doesn’t lie. It shows you exactly what you’re made of — usually blood, panic, and very bad decisions.

The DLCs feel like the memories I tried hardest to bury. Fragments, regrets, things I didn’t want to relive but kept resurfacing like the swamp water in my lungs. Some offered closure. Some reopened wounds that never had time to close.

I survived.
But survival feels like a technicality.

The build up to this game was good, and the first 20mins set the scene well. You're looking for your fiance that disappeared 3yrs ago because she recently contacted you with her location. You drive to a desolate swamp in Louisiana and find an abandoned house and shack. At this point the game started getting really creepy, and I enjoyed how it was building up. It reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You find your fiance locked up in the basement. Turns out she's been possessed by something. She attacks you with a knife and you defend yourself with your bare hands. She stabs right through your hand and I was like ""oh shit..."". About 10secs later your pour hydrogen peroxide on the wound and it magically heals up. Really? This immediately killed the immersion for me. 2mins later, your SAME hand gets stabbed again. Then it gets cut off by a chainsaw. At that point I was like ""Oh SHIT!"". You get a pistol and somehow reload the gun while holding the gun with your only hand. It made very little sense. I'm not kidding, about 2mins later, your hand gets stapled back on like nothing happened. This was like a slap in the face. I always thought these games were more realistic. Sure they have monsters and zombies, but I didn't know the main character was a fucking super human. To make things worse, I got stuck right after the dinner scene and didn't know where to go. I was already bored so I let the psycho kill me. He hit me about 10-15 times, and I'm playing on normal difficulty. I plan on finishing this game, but my expectations are pretty low at this point.

I've tried so much to like it, but I get bored and cannot come to terms with the limited gameplay, even though there's so much customization with different weapons, skills and attribute combinations.

The game world lacks soul, even though everybody says that there's a very engaging main story with plot twists, which I cannot find the courage to follow because of the boring gameplay.

I used to love old JRPGS on SNES and PSX, but there was the perceived freedom that you were in an open world. This game just throws you in a PS2-like linear minimap that you have to navigate and inevitably come across a minimap boss that looks like it's come from the Dark Souls series.

Where it falls short is the actual gameplay and mechanics. It's uninspired and boring. When you learn to dodge and parry, then every battle or confrontation becomes painfully mundane. I found myself only doing the battles I needed to just to move the story along so I could watch the movie. This could be a great movie when it comes out.

I am high-functionally autistic, so I prefer turn-based games over real-time action because my reactions are kinda … slow.
I can manage to survive many real-time action games in „story“/„easy“ mode, so we are not talking about pathological impairments here.
I WILL keep the game, and I so much WANT to love it for its deep story and beautiful art design, but there is one complaint I need to state here as an official bug report or feature request - WHEN I SET EASIEST STORY MODE, I WANT A FAIR EASY STORY MODE!!!
LOWER THE DODGE/PARRYING TIMINGS ASAP! 
IF PLAYERS WANT CHALLENGING TIMINGS, THEY DON‘T CHOOSE STORY MODE!

I am very much willing to totally twist around my review to thumbs up and praise if you are so kind to reach out to me and/or somehow reconsider your choice in quicktime timings and hardness to be more inclusive for those who are not just „too lazy to get good“, but at a weaker point at all. Why must games be so hard in general without including additional customers (more than you might think?) to also be served with a great game?
I am willing to practice and learn, but within my personal comfort zone and capabilities.
If there is a story mode, make it a fair story mode, not a 1% less super-hard-mode, in my very personal opinion, this is almost false advertising at its finest.
PLEASY, MAKE IT SUPER HARD FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE HARD MODE, 
You can design achievements only for those playing harder modes, I am with you, or give more or less XP in-game for harder play styles, but please don‘t exclude players that are just more casual or even have some limits. Your game is pretty, packed with story and emotion, why exclude such a wide range of players from enjoying it?

The reason for this seems to be some kind of moral system whereby if you moral drops to zero it's as good as dying, only you can heal health and avoid fights, but you cannot avoid skill checks, unless you just want to remain in your hotel room and go nowhere and do nothing.

Full Review:
This isn't a game for people who've been through certain types of trauma. Namely, trauma having to do with your self esteem and value. First of all, you do NOT get to customize a character. One is given to you and he's already a psychological mess. If you have deep wells of empathy this game will trigger you in a way that is more harmful than good. The overall message is for people who haven't yet developed the skills or life experience to understand the illusion of choice is not freedom. It's a game with a very dark, nihilistic message. While Nihilism can be enlightening and even freeing for some people, this game doesn't really allow you to explore those aspects of it. It tends to repeatedly highlight only the worse parts of humanity in a context absent of hope or empathy. Why the devs would include an entire segment of dialogue that analyzes and breaks down racism in support of it, is a confusing and concerning choice. There are better ways of exposing how toxic racism is without glorifying at the same time. The game is definitely thought provoking but it does it in a very abusive manner that could be harmful to people who struggle with CPTSD, AuDHD and healthy emotional regulation. 
This game shook me because I've already learned the darker lessons and hard truths life ultimately teaches you. I didn't need a rerun of trauma and I think the lessons could be learned without it, but I understand why some people feel it's necessary. It might be a great game, but it's not for everybody and that's why I can't recommend it.",False,2,3,1763665357

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198877995722,"I decided to write this review since I see a lot of people have a rough time with the entry barrier into Master Duel. 

Master Duel is described by Konami as the place where you will duel at the highest level and when they say highest level they are not downplaying it. First things you need to be aware of is that yes there is a barrier when you start playing that at first might seem overwhelming, but you need to remember you are jumping at the deep-end of the Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling experience. Some people criticize Master Duel for not being beginner friendly, and although I do agree there is a curve to adapt to in terms of dueling, specially for people who are returning to Yu-Gi-Oh after many years away or people who have only watched the anime or who are experiencing the brand for the first time, I also think the game gives you the tools so that you are able to build a strong deck very early into the game. 

Chances are yes you are going to get whooped during your first couple of duels, but that is to be expected since you are at the first steps of your deck building but if you put your time to learn the ins and outs of the game, it is a great way to enjoy the franchise. 

Some useful things things for people willing to give it a shot:
- Master Duel is very very F2P friendly, the game gives you so many easy ways to get gems (the currency used for opening packs) and occasionally even give you full structure-decks through things like friend code referral and such. If you manage your gems correctly you can easily make a viable competitive deck in just a few minutes and can probably average a new deck every month or so.

- Do your tutorials (skip them if you have a basic understanding of the game) and after, when picking one of the 3 beginners decks, just pick the one that matches your latest understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! 

- Before entering ranked matches, go to solo mode and there you will find many ""missions"" that reward you with cosmetics such as mates, duel fields, sleeves and even some actual card, but most importantly finishing the Duel Strategy missions reward you with a total of 2,400 gems. By doing solo mode not only can you unlock different rewards but you will also fulfill some of the challenges and missions that reward you with even more gems. 

- Now when it comes to currencies we have gems which are used to open card packs and just buy anything from the store and you also have crafting points (CP) ranging from Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare points. These CP are used to craft cards individually which is helpful if the card you are looking for is not available on any dedicated pack or if you only need to craft 1 copy of that card. In principle crafting a card take 30 CP regardless of the rarity (and when crafting there is a random chance of it being one of three different types of foiling which basically just means how shiny the card will be). Then some cards you don't want can be dismantled into CP of the corresponding rarity of the card going from 10 - 30 CP depending on the foiling of the card dismantled. One thing to note with CP is that not all cards can be dismantled as some free cards you get wont be able to be dismantled, but every card from pack openings can be dismantled into CP (cards from structure decks can't be dismantled tho). Best tip is to spend your SR CP and UR CP wisely and only when you really want or need a card since they are the hardest points to gather at first.

- Now before building a deck, opening packs and crafting cards you need to ask yourself the most important question when joining Master Duel for the first time - Which deck do you want to play with? - This is the most important decision you will have to make since the deck you chose will be your partner for the first month or so, so more than a meta deck just go for the one you will have the most fun with.

- Once you know which deck you want to go with, the best thing to do is to just create a deck and add all the cards you will want in it, that way you will know which cards you have, which cards you are missing and their respective rarities. Then you have to best options, one of them is to take one SR or UR card from that archetype and craft it, in doing so you will unlock a secret pack from that archetype which then you can spend your gems opening packs to get cards from that archetype. You can also go into the store and look at the structure decks and see if the archetype you want is available there, that way by spending 500 gems you will get access to the core of the archetype and can be a shortcut to building your desired deck.

- 2 PRO TIPS when it comes to gems are NEVER SPEND GEMS on the MASTER PACK since the amount of cards in it makes it impossible to get anything you actually want (you are better sticking to secret packs) and also ALWAYS BUY THE DUEL PASS since this battle pass not only returns your gem investment if completed but also rewards you with limited-time accessories and tons of CP from all the rarities.

- If you really want to add a meta element to your deck you can also go to the shop special section and under bundle deals you will see bundles with 10 Master Packs and also a meta staple card. 

- With all of this said if you dismantle any and every card you dont need and if you claim your rewards and open more packs you will end up with a good deck to enter ranked as any cards you dont get can probably be crafted with the CP earned from the dismantle of cards. 

When it comes to dueling the game helps you flagging posible actions that can be taken or cards that can be played in case you are not fully experienced with your deck. As you climb through ranked you will earn more gems that can be used to make your deck stronger and such. 

Again, as this is a competitive TCG it does take time to settle in but the more time you put and as long as you are playing cards that are fun to you I really think this game has a lot to offer for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. Ranked might be a tough pill to swallow at first but by making mistakes and losing duels is how you will learn.

While naturally it shares every issue with normal gameplay of the real card game, it also goes much deeper then that. First point: The gatcha system (while theres certainly FAR worse ones out there) is terrible. Grinding gems takes forever and once you've cleared solo mode, say goodbye to ever getting anything new ever again, because the game will VERY slowly drip feed you a paultry sum of gems IF YOU WIN a ranked match and thats about it (GOOD LUCK winning without a tier 0 deck)

Second point: Cheaters. The game is FULL of them. Everything you can imagine. FTK bots, AFK bots, players who can see your hand at all times, people who manipulate the cards drawn on both sides, deck stacking, its awful and nearly unplayable.

Third point: The TERRIBLE and WILDLY inconsistent banlist. So...you're telling me that the current tier 0 (which has been tier 0 for nearly 3 months now) doesn't have a single card even so much as semi-limited, but secret village, card of demise, POT OF PROSPERITY are banned? Maxx C is at 2. Pot of duality is at 1. What.

Fourth point: It is VERY begginer hostile. The game just expects you to casually pay over 100 REAL LIFE dollars to MAYBE get a CHANCE at getting specific cards that are essential and you litterally CAN NOT win even in rookie without. 

Fifth point: Bugs. And lots of them. I get this is the most complex card game of all time so naturally, when in digital form, its not gurenteed to work properly every time, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Were getting nonsense like a card that does NOT have to be face-up to resolve somehow fizzeling after being MST'd, cards whos activation requirement is something like ""Target 1 card you control"" and somehow not being allowed to activate it despite the fact there is NOTHING preventing targeting anywhere, special summoning from the grave with necrovalley on the field, ect ect. FIX YOUR GAME KONAMI

sixth point: The horrible meta: I get this is an issue in the TCG and OCG as well, but due to the wonky and weird banlist, i think its at its worst here. You better REALLY enjoy seeing the same 3 decks, because once you get past bronze its ALLLLL youre ever going to see for the rest of your life.

Seventh point: While this is not 100% proven yet, there is evidence to suggest the game is bias for asian players. Letting asian players start every duel with 3 different handtraps plus 2 different 1 card starters every single game whilst giving the english players 3 same named HOPT cards and 2 extenders that can't play through 3 hand traps. Or for the first time in 20 duels you open maxx c but AWWW DIDNT MATTER because the asian player opened ash, 2 starters, and extender, TTT, and maxx c themselves. It happens SO often and is almost always exlusively from asian players, that I am convinced the game plays favorites.

eighth point: The community is ULTRA toxic. No one is helpful, everyone is hostile, and everyone thinks theyre king of games while everyone else is worthless peasents. Any time you complain about ANYTHING its always ""skill issue"" (despite 50% of the game being luck) No, its not ""skill issue"" that konami themselves wanted the opponent to win and gave them 4 hand traps and a starter whilst not giving me and handtraps or breakers, thats RNG, not skill.


Overall, I simply can NOT recommend this horrible game to anyone who values their life or sanity. If you enjoy being screwed over by RNG while everyone who you simply ask for help or tips from mock you, go ahead, but no thanks. Im good.",False,1,0,1764173621

From the start of the game to the credit roll, Nier is a pleasant and melancholic game that pours a lot of attention into its side quests to paint a picture of life in a dying world.  It's a game as much about loving the NPCs struggling day after day as it is about its character-driven main story.

However, you may be aware that Nier is a game with multiple endings.  Rather than a choice of parallel endings that you see in many RPGs, this game follows from Drakengard and VNs in having sequential endings that build upon each other.  Or at least, they try to.

The positive part of my review ends at the credit roll for Ending A.  (Or a little after—the backstory you get for Kainé just after is also easily worthwhile.)  To reach the other endings, you have to repeat sections of the game again and again and again.  The actual new content is minimal—just a few extra cutscenes stretched thin across old bones.  What new content there is is rarely interesting, instead repeating or expanding emotional points that were already present in the original playthrough and could've been included the first time around.  The personality flaws of the main cast go unexplored, and the extra characterisation for your enemies changes the story from a tragedy into a tone-deaf farce.  Meanwhile, what emotional impact the story originally had is scrubbed off as you sit through the same scenes again and again, waiting for it to be over.

It should also be noted that combat itself is very shallow, and really doesn't stand up to replay.  By my final run of the ending boss gauntlet, I had figured out several points [i]during combat[/i] where I was free to scroll on my phone while button mashing or evading one-handed, barely glancing at the game screen.

Another Awful thing about this game is there are things that take up a ridiculous amount of time and that are very unnecessary and annoying. There are parts where it MAKES YOU WALK and not just lil parts, When you're searching for EMIL you have to walk the entire time through the mansion at a snails pace and it really really makes it agonizing.. same with the light house, same with the boat, its weird and very very aggravating. One other horrible thing is basically there is NO FAST TRAVEL you spend hours running back and fourth between the same 4 places eventually they give you a guy on a boat that can take you places but hes always so far outta the way and not easy to get to that you might as well just run because you're gonna get there in the same amount a time give or take a few seconds.

This game was so lazy that instead of making a village they made a small room with trees in it with 4 npcs that were ""townspeople"".. Instead of it being a new area with a new boss.. its a ""dream forest"" where the mayor talks to you in text as if you were part of their dream and you fall victim to a ""death dream""
disease. The game then reads you PAGES of text and if you don't answer the changing text correct;y you have to start over and that my friends is one of the bosses/stages. Its most def one of the laziest things ive ever seen.

The games story isn't so bad it really isn't but if you're looking for a game like NeiR:Automata you're going to be extremely disappointed. I played through every single ending hoping something fun was gonna happen... instead i played the same exact thing 4 times out of 5 with the 5th being the weakest ending... ever.


This game WAS LEFT WITH/HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL FROM NEIR: AUTOTMATA THAT IT COULDA DONE ANYTHING ANYYYYYTHING STORY WISE BUT NOPE IT JUST PICKED SOME RANDOM CRAP AND RAN WITH IT.
2025 and the game has 166 positive reviews. These i assume are all fan boys of NeiR: Automata which was an amazing game and they probably can't put their bias aside to call this game what it is... a turd.

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198260401907,"[b]""Nier Replicant"" might have been a decent game back in 2010—with its deep lore (which laid the foundation for the ""Nier Automata"" masterpiece), eerie atmosphere, philosophical writing, compelling characters, and fantastic music. But its 2021 remaster assumes it still fits the modern gaming landscape and has something fresh to offer. Unfortunately, it falls short.
The world feels empty and generic, the visuals are mediocre, and the gameplay mechanics are dated—reduced to following dots on a map and completing trivial fetch quests. Combat is shallow, with limited abilities and builds, repetitive enemies, problematic camera angles, and virtually no environmental sound design. Long, tiring walks and constant backtracking through the same locations make the experience feel like a chore. Worst of all, the game forces players to replay the same content up to five times to see the full story.
Had I played it back in 2010, I might have felt differently. I'm not sure because some thing would still bother me. But releasing it at full AAA price in 2021 invites comparison to modern titles—and by today’s standards, it simply doesn’t deserve your time or money.


Manometer: 4/10[/b]  


The good
- Interesting concept: The lore is rich and later became the backbone of ""Nier Automata"". The writing explores philosophical themes and occasionally becomes poetic. The text-adventure-style segments are especially beautiful.
- Well-crafted characters: Though a bit stereotypical, the main cast has vivid personalities that are easy to love.
- Despite the empty world and average visuals, the game creates a haunting, fairy-tale-like ambiance.
- The soundtrack is stunning and enhances the mood—though it plays constantly and can become overwhelming.
- Voice acting performances lean toward the epic rather than realistic, but they effectively convey each character’s personality and intent
- Nice, fluid animations with smooth transitions between moves. The feeling on the controller is great. It's nice that most weapons have different move sets.
- Well designed boss battles. Uniquely designed encounters that blend platforming mechanics with reflex-based challenges
- Battles are mediocre yet mixing melee attacks with projectile magic is a nice idea that adds a layer of depth.
- A subtle, clever sense of humor lightens the tone without becoming silly.

The bad
- I know it's a 2010 game, yet I was expecting more in this remaster especially after the ""Nier Automata"" success. Most models are low-poly, textures are poor (sometimes tiled), and the world feels repetitive and generic. Invisible walls and frequent loading screens break immersion.
- Again, this is a remaster of an older game but in 2021 a lot of things look obsolete. It's open world logic is completely worn forcing you to blindly follow markers on the map. A lot of the main objectives look like fetch quest as you have to go to various characters to see what they need. Its world is too small with only a few regions that the game forces you to visit again and again to face different enemies that weren't there before. In addition to that each region is usually filled with copy-paste corridors. All this repetition makes it boring.
- Shallow RPG mechanics. Few abilities and weapon combinations mean limited build diversity. New gear is usually just a straight upgrade, removing strategic choices.
- You have to walk into unbelievable long distances. Quests often send you back and forth to the same locations with minimal shortcuts. A lot of times after beating all the enemies in a region and fulfilling the objective, you have to backtrack though empty rooms. The fast travel mechanics that it offers are silly and don't alleviate the grind.
- Battle is mediocre. Despite teaching various tactics, most fights devolve into button-mashing chaos. A lot of battles become an indistinct blend of enemies and balls. It usually feels like they're undesigned. In addition to that healing or using items via menu pauses breaks the flow and feels outdated
- Except from the bosses, regular enemies are completely generic. Aside from bosses, most foes are indistinct black shapes with no unique traits. They just filled every region with the same enemies. Easily some of the most boring encounters I've ever met in a video game.
- Pointless side quests: Tasks like “bring an egg” or “fetch a watermelon” lack narrative depth and disrupt the main story’s vibes and continuity. Overall pacing is problematic Repeated visits to the library to speak with Popola feel unimaginative.
- It has multiple endings, yet after the first playthrough it becomes a chore. While multiple playthroughs reveal new story elements, they require replaying large portions of the game with no changes at all. Unlike ""Nier Automata"" which offered fresh perspectives and gameplay shifts it forces you even to go through repeated dialogues smashing the skip button just to unlock a few new cutscenes. It's an unbelievable choice that they punish you with this boring repetitiveness if you want to learn the whole story. Even more unbelievable is that you have to find all weapons in order to go through ending C.
- Cameras are weird and problematic. The camera often fails to follow the protagonist properly, and manual rotation is sluggish. Sudden shifts to top-down or side-view angles are too often feel arbitrary and disorienting—unlike ""Automata, where such changes were purposeful and enhanced gameplay. Here all these side scrolling platforming sessions and scenes that look like old arcades seem to be rushed and not so successful.
- Boss battles are well designed with some interesting mechanics, yet this thing with their health bars is a joke. These are inconsistent and confusing. Bars refill or change without clear logic, making it hard to gauge progress and turning them into a gimmick.
- Despite the deep lore and the good writing the the core narrative is basic and often relies on melodramatic clichés like self-sacrifice or excessive epic moments. 
- There is no environmental sound design at all. Here music dominates every scene, leaving no room for ambient sounds that could enhance immersion. Even moments of silence would have added depth.
- Ok it's not a puzzle game but if you decide to put some of them in there better make them interesting. The few puzzle rooms are overly simplistic and feel like filler content for children.
- Unbalanced difficulty. The game is generally too easy.. You will die only one or two time during a few boss battles. There is no challenge at all. Also, In subsequent playthroughs enemies remain mid-game strong while you’re at new game++ level. They cannot even touch you and you almost one hit kill them. Really boring.",False,3,1,1759763348

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198117360203,"I played Automata back in 2017. Being much younger, tolerating stuff like ""you have to beat the game 3 times to reach the ending"" wasn't really an issue. Now in 2025, I sadly do not have the same free time to spend it on games like Replicant.

First things first. This game should have been a complete remake. This game actually feels like a very good remaster, in the sense that you feel like you are playing a PS3 game. The problem is, this remaster was released in 2021. So many other very good games came out that year so we dont really have much when it comes to technology not being enough. Toylogic simply didn't take any risks. The gameplay is incredibly stale, upgrades are mostly unnecessary and boring, spells are pretty fun for the first couple of hours but then get forgotten. The game nearly always felt like a chore to play. And I had to finish the game twice (Well actually 3 times if you want to see the real ending but i couldnt be arsed and watched it on youtube.) They really should have mishmashed Automata's different weapon styles with Reincarnation's spells to make it unique.

Enemies. Boring. Small dude. Big dude. Big dude with shield. Even bigger dude. Even bigger dude with shield. The bosses were pretty cool but there sadly are 5 of them and you are constantly put against them because of the repetition which kills their uniqueness. Again, extremely boring due to repetitiveness. Which is a very common issue with the game overall.

Scenery. It is pretty decent looking. For a PS3 game. For a remaster that was released in 2021, it looks bleak, the colors are dead and the settings are just bland. Some scenes were pretty but I never got the same feeling I got from Automata's introductions to new areas. 

Characters. Now this is a strange topic because Nier games are all about mystery and being attached to these characters who are put through hell for us to enjoy. I don't like the brother sister troupe so it was a miss for me (which is a personal thing and not an objective critisism) but the tones the characters give off is very weird. Nier, the main dude, is basically a slave. First to his sister, then to the villagers, then to his comrades, and finally to the village leaders. He is one of those main characters who never asks anything and just helps people around for the sake of helping. Then does a complete 180 and becomes something completely else. With no buildup, it just doesn't work. Side characters are pretty unique but without spoilers, I don't really like how they evolve as well. They lose their uniqueness while becoming generic with each minute you spend together.

And yes. The story. Yes, Yoko Taro fashion, it tells a very unique story with intense twists and turns. But I highly doubt it's worth the 35+ hour slogfest of mashing 2 buttons while going from marker to a marker. My recommendation is just read / watch an explanation about the story and skip to NieR: Automata. If they remaster Drankengard like this, I'm staying the hell away from it this time around.",False,3,0,1758739846

Gameplay is defined by its interactivity. Almost every object, surface, and environmental element can be manipulated. Fire spreads, water conducts electricity, and poison ignites. Combat becomes a puzzle where creative thinking often wins over brute force. This system rewards experimentation, not repetition.

Character creation and progression are flexible. Players can customize skills, attributes, and abilities without being locked into rigid classes. Cooperative play enhances this freedom—two players can explore, argue over choices, or separate to pursue different objectives simultaneously. The resulting dynamics make co-op feel organic rather than forced.

Visually, the Enhanced Edition improves textures, lighting, and interface clarity while keeping the game’s distinct hand-painted fantasy style. The redesigned UI and full voice acting make exploration and dialogue more immersive. Every conversation and environment feels alive and reactive.

The writing maintains a balance between wit and seriousness. Quests often carry multiple solutions, and morality is never simple. Whether you’re solving a murder, arguing with a talking shell, or deciding the fate of an entire village, the game constantly invites critical thinking and reflection.

In essence, Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a masterclass in player agency and tactical depth. It’s challenging, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Every decision feels personal, every victory earned through intellect and creativity. It stands as one of the finest examples of modern role-playing design rooted in classic principles.",True,1,0,1762683612

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198160031418,"This game to me is one that deserves a mixed rating. While I liked the game and had fun playing it, there were plenty of times  when it felt more of a slog to get through. The world is semi open-world that is both good and bad. Constant Saving felt like a must

Starting off, making my characters was fun, there were a good amount of classes to choose from. Playing around with some starting skill options, personal customization was ok nothing too crazy for the Two Player Characters you create as my heroes.
A few voices to choose from, personalities etc. Not everything in the game is voiced, most MC dialogue gets voiced with their little side quips, side characters here and there, most dialogue will be read. A few companions to choose from, I choose two and rocked with them, since I believe if you swap them in later their level's won't match yours, needs more testing?

Combat was fun and not fun, while it worked and gave me chances to be creative with combining the environment, items I have, spells and such to fight, it meant the enemy could do the same. With the world being open-ish often I'd find myself in fights I wasn't going to win, the battles can drag on since the AI sometime is fast, othertimes It's like Internet Explorer making a turn. Getting wiped just to fight the same long tedious fight drags on, trying multiple strats just to get perma stunned by 5+ enemies. The wide variety of spells and weapon types means you have to adjust based on the enemy, with some damage types healing them, (my best weapons healed the final boss, that was fun).

Locales/Vibes- locations looked great, it felt like an adventure, from simple beaches (how original lol) to ancient caves and tombs to spirit realms & even to the ends of time. In the same vein some locations were terrible, like the Luculla Sandstorm,  nothing was fun about making a conga line with my party to pull the enemy, spending 20 minutes to beat a enemy then running away to escape combat and teleport away just to rinse and repeat. 
There are traps and secrets hidden in the world, things like hidden grave to lava traps.

Puzzles, some felt fun and rewarding, while the majority were just annoying and killed the pace and fun of the game, You'll need to be used to separating your party and multi-tasking with them, along with reading everything ever. Or needing very ""specific"" weights needed on weight plates. Many of them feel like they're trying to be overly clever and are doing too much imo. 

This is the kind of game where you need to interact and talk with everyone and everything, which takes forever. Even then you'll still miss things and interactions. If only I realized my choices in events that gave my character points in their personality things like ""vindictive, pragmatic, romantic"" etc actually affected my character stats and potential dialogue options that could lock you out of things. Along with knowing what items can actually be dragged onto others to work.

To me, this game would make one do new runs over and over to fix their mistakes if they get softlocked. So yeah you could respec everything except personality points from dialog and benefits/detriments, but what if you lose your skills? So what if i can buy them again or craft them again except the skills for my Knight and ranger? Ones that can't be gotten again? I committed to my build and mistake and suffered for it. Some skills felt useless and were a waste of precious talent points. My rogue had near max stealth skill, and I was still getting discovered, so I just used his ""Make Invisible"" skill which actually worked and was 1000x better.

Quick Side note, Don't sell Tenebrium items to merchants, I then had to deal with dying merchants for the rest of the game, I kept alive with my mage spamming Rejuvenates.

An annoyance to me was near the end game, I couldn't progress past a door needing me to have Blood stone/Star Stones, story/lore items that also double as ""full party heals"" basically omega tier heals. It said I didn't have enough but I already went everywhere I could ingame. So there I was backtracking the whole game searching high and low for these supposed stones. I found one, the only last one, but he still wouldn't open. How was I supposed to know I needed to use my rare healing stones? Then after that go to my homebase to talk to some merchants for the door to then open saying I was then worthy.

While I did enjoy my time with this game, those moments were here and there bogged down by slow moments, overtuned encounters, overly annoying puzzles, slow combat and general shenanigans one would expect from this style of game. Again I say to better enjoy the game, it'd take multiple runs/attempts. It'd be more fun for me now that I know how it plays out and how to spec better. I'd recommend it to people who like this type of game and difficulty, however to the casual RPG gamer who just wants to have easy fun without thinking, no stress kind of thing, this isn't for you.",False,0,1,1760780429

The humor? Chef's kiss.
The characters? Absolute chaos goblins with personality.
The graphics? Weirdly gorgeous for a game that’s not exactly new anymore. Honestly, half the time I forgot this thing came out years ago, because everything looks like it has been polished by a team of very dedicated fantasy elves.

And the classes? Amazing. You can basically create anything from a teleporting rogue assassin who politely stabs people in the face… to a necromantic violinist who heals by bleeding on things. Truly art.

But then… Source Points happen.

Ah, yes. Source Points. The magical energy that fuels your strongest abilities, your coolest spells, is needed to acomplish dungeons/quests, and—apparently—your greatest frustration in life.

It’s not that the game limits you on them. That would actually be interesting, right? Making tough choices, thinking strategically, feeling the weight of your decisions?

Nope.
Divinity says: “You can refill them endlessly, dear player!”
And then quietly adds:
“…Just run back and forth like a lost chicken to do it.”

Why?
Why give me infinite refills… but only if I prove my dedication by jogging across Rivellon like I’m training for a marathon?
Why ruin the pacing of such a brilliant game with a mechanic that feels like an unpaid internship?

Instead of epic adventure, I get Source Point Fetch Quest Simulator 2017.

And that’s when my enthusiasm died a dramatic, theatrical death. Not by combat. Not by a boss. But by pure, uncut inconvenience. It’s like the game whispered:
""You like fun? Too bad. Go touch another puddle of ghost juice, peasant.""

So, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is still an incredible game with unforgettable humor, beautiful visuals, and rich gameplay.
But Source Points?
Yeah, no. Hard pass. When a mechanic makes me feel like I’m clocking in for my shift, I put down the controller and walk away.

A masterpiece held hostage by a mechanic that thinks I have the free time of a bored god. If Larian ever patches Source Points into something less annoying, I’m back in. Until then… Rivellon, it’s not you. It’s your weird energy system.",False,1,1,1763244560

Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198133077347,"I really would love to like this game. It has engaging combat, a great multiplayer and interactivity that I have not seen before.
The start at Fort Joy is amazing to play. It's the best balanced and the most well-rounded. I always knew where to go, always found new things to explore and I never felt lost story wise.

All of this starts to turn around in the following acts and I feel like it gets worse or at least more glaring the further you progress. 
These glaring issues for me are:

[b] ""Open World"" [/b]
On Fort Joy the open world felt rewarding. The battles were challenging but beatable. So, I was delighted to see what may come after Fort Joy.

What I ended up finding were ""natural"" level barriers that forced my friend and I to follow a linear route to so that we could beat the battles (note that we played on normal).
Finding this linear route after the game told us to pick and choose where we wish to go next just felt confusing. In total it took us a month to progress (we played once every week). We desperately staked out which area might be appropriate for our level 12 characters. I still remember each area of the second act and which level is associated with. 
Perhaps we where unfortunate to not have chosen this path. Mayhaps, we simply overread an important dialog pointing us towards the right direction.
The only thing I know for sure is that the only for us beatable area was [spoiler]in the top left corner[/spoiler] of the map.

You have to pass multiple other areas with higher levels to get there.
Nevertheless, this area was still a mighty struggle. We fought with everything we had. We strategized about each battle. After every loss we took notes, regrouped and attacked again. Every potential ""exploit"" we could see, we utilized.

This level of tenacity does not feel appropriate for a normal difficulty playthrough at least not for me.

[u]Recommendation[/u]
The pre-set levels with the exponential leveling system to not work together with the ""open world"" aspect of the game.
I'll get more in-depth with the leveling in the next part, but giving the player the directive to ""reign freely"" while setting fixed levels to the enemies does not add up. 
Adjusting the enemies to the level the player is feels way more appropriate. Maybe, sprinkle in some fixed levels as a boss to really stop the player if the story demands it, but putting this everywhere is just misguided. 

Especially since it let to us loosing track of the story completely. We started each quests, but we could never finish them due to the battles. So after a week or two we came back to the quest without having a clue of what was going on. (The in-game journal is quite lack luster on this regard)

[b]Levelling[/b]
In total you can get up to level [spoiler]21[/spoiler], which feels a little low looking at other RPGs. The issue I have with this is that you are at level [spoiler]12 when leaving Fort Joy[/spoiler]. This leads to the weird situation that levels are exponentially more important the closer you get to the max level.

At first you may be able to win a battle against a two levels higher foe, but towards the end if you are not on the same level as your enemy, you get demolished.
We literally couldn't defeat the final boss since we were one level below it. Coincidentally, we also were at a point were we felt like we completed every quest available to us. After trying for another fruitless three weeks, we loaded a previous save and tried to squeeze out another level so we have even an inkling of a chance.

As a [u]recommendation[/u] I can just offer a proper re-balancing of the later areas and a plead for general level cap increase. In the last stages of the game seeing the next level XP requirement to be in the millions is disheartening.

[b]Quest Management[/b]
A more minute point but it feels like the bad cherry on top of the issue cake. 
The in-game journal feels in-adequate to help the player remember story points and even gist's of quests. The best you can hope for is a red marker on your map, and a small to-do entry. The point of the quest, the afflicted affiliations and the severity are often not included. 

Especially after our 3-week excursion through level barrier hell, we essentially reached a point of mindless ""red flag grinding"". I at least felt like a zombie trying to stave my XP-hunger by any means possible. So, every found quest was like a 3-star prepared meal and I devoured it as far as I could, but the chef seemed to hate me and always put glass shards in the food so that I had to come back to it later after my gums were accustomed to the ""difficulty"" (Essentially I needed to level to beat a foe)

Everything combined together let to me loosing completely any inkling of the story.

A small anecdote concerning story. My friend and I felt like we managed to skip great chunks of it unwillingly. One example for this is the story around Gareth.

For me it felt as follows: [spoiler]The great leader Gareth managed to escape the prison island Fort Joy with the help of his divine acquaintances (us). Together they set sail to Reaper's Coast where Gareth's parents resided. He immediately went to his parents but Magisters seemed to have been a step ahead of him. The battle did not take long, but neither did the triumph. Beneath rubble lay two corpses ... his parents. Silently he buried them. A deep anger begins taking hold of Gareth. Before he could do anything reckless his two divine acquaintances appear. He told them what happened. The trio stood there silently. Until one divine spoke up: ""It is what it is, bro"".

These words quiet the anger immediately and Gareth went back to the ship never do to anything of note again.
[/spoiler] 

I do not know how one should experience his tale but this is beyond ridiculous.

This was roughly the experience I had with almost all of the story points which is why during the end credits I felt like I was being introduced to new characters since I could not for the life of me remember who any of the characters even where.

My [u]recommendation[/u] for this one would be to add more information to the journal, and to add a glossary to keep track of the different parties, their goals and what the situation currently is. The chapters setup did not help at all. It rather added to the confusion because some quests where chapter-overlapping, so they never disappeared.

[b]Gear[/b]
I had a very unique problem with gear throughout the whole game. Namely, I was often stuck with too low leveled gear because of set combos. These set combos gave me unique traits which I liked, but I could never transition smoothly to a new set due to bonuses of the set combo.

So my solution would be to upgrade my gear, but there is no way to level up gear. There is a DLC-esque bundle modifications containing the gear sisters. Which adds four sister merchants in the game which sell you (limited) quantities of gear upgrade ingredients. Even if you managed to pay their insanely steep prices (easily 10k per PIECE). Their limited quantity would not even allow you to upgrade a full set of unique gear ONCE.

I re-iterate my final gear that was a 5 piece armor set, was physically not possible to be upgraded fully ONCE even if I collected ALL the armor upgrade ingredients.

[u]Recommendation[/u]: Please let me upgrade my gear, I'm begging you.

[b]Overall[/b], I think the game has a fantastic premise, but these points just gave me such frustration while playing that I simply felt saddened by the thought of what could be. If I'm just unlucky with how my playthrough went please tell me what I could have done. I'd really love to find my appreciation again for this game.",False,2,0,1762818932
Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198051875226,"Crashes frequently. Different places, different times, whether playing a few minutes or for longer periods of time. Crashes in Fort Joy walking into arena. Crashes in Reaper's Coast. Game simply exits. No error message, warning, or indication about to exit. Just back to desktop.

Windows recommended compatibility settings for Windows 8. Larian support page recommended running game directly without Steam. Still crashes on windows 10. Played fine for a while. Then doesn't play fine. 

Camera is visually disorienting when edge panning due to elevation changes (trees, cliffs, anything similar). Camera jumps high, jumps low. When scrolling around to see where to go, find a chest, road, or something, this is just plain awful.

Find a place you want to go on the big map? No way to click a point and instruct party to go there. Exit map and walk there bit by bit or scroll the area (with that disorienting up / down camera going across terrain), find your spot, click and hope your party doesn't stop for ground obstructions or obstacles.

Mario 64 has better camera free look than Divinity OS 1 or 2.  That's on Nintendo 64! 
I don't know how beta testers didn't get headaches from this camera in Divinity 2.

General rule of thumb appears to be destroy opponents before they get turns. Enemy turns take a long time. Sometimes, game decides to think about what to do (I guess?) so a minute or so later, finally completes that opponent's turn. Now do it again for the other 5+ in the fight. No way to skip this waiting.

Battles are so monotonous on enemy turns, I do something in another monitor. Maybe that's why I get crashes ... trying to play windowed. I don't know. Battles are time consuming and boring. Wait, wait, and wait some more. Oh, you're incapacitated? No turn for you. Now wait again. Oh, look, still incapacitated. Just reload game, try to knock them into incapacitated statuses first. Or just explore elsewhere, come back with another level or two, and wonder why they were difficult at all.

Some waypoints should be closer, especially when a story quest sends you somewhere repeatedly. 

The quest log ... is unusable the more quests appear on the list. No search option. So you play along, get a message such and such quest updated, go to look. Spend 20 minute reading them line by line looking for this quest that IS NOT THERE!! Where is it? I don't know. I saw the message, I know the name. I can google it. I cannot find it in the log. The log is USELESS clutter. The internet is easier if you're looking for a particular quest, details, story, or what to do. The built in quest log in this game is unusable as it enlarges with various quest tidbits. A search feature would help immensely here. Same for inventory for finding something. Some prankster designed a chest that you must be in precisely the right camera position to actually reach. Thankfully, there's a skill to just put stuff like that into your inventory without that level of work. After 5 minutes of trying to copy from a youtube video, I gave up and used the spell. That's just bad design.

Game's a time suck. Get used to it eventually. Pace of combat is slow. You can click faster than the game is ready, ending up walking somewhere instead of actually using a skill from your hotbar. Camera is horrible for elevation up / downs. Other games have similar jerkiness in their camera movements as well. This game, you have to look around and that's difficult to have occur so much, even just rotating around to see the terrain for a battle.

Oh, and my favorite is staring at the game waiting for combat to advance only to see the message: Not your character's turn. Have to go click on your portrait to do your turn. The game didn't put it there automatically. Seems random when it occurs.

 I must've put in 30+ hours without a crash. Then, one day, crash after crash. Install new software? No. Change drivers? No. Skip playing a week or so, then put in a long time - all the way to Arx with maybe two crashes. Fire up next day, try a new game for kicks to experiment, four crashes before even escape Fort Joy. That's not fun.

Divinity OS 2 has easier inventory management (still a pain with a lot of stuff) and equipping gear, spells, etc. than Divinity 1. Game 1 is more stable on my windows 10. Game 2 crashes - a lot. That's what sucks the fun right out of number 2.

Also, divinity 2 has less of all that creepy blood emphasis of game 1.
It just crashes repeatedly :(

The graphics are pretty good for everything other than the people, and if that's a sticking point for you then I would still recommend going with the remaster either via upgrade or buying it outright.
There is a good range on difficulty from Very Easy, to Ultra Hard. I personally found it to be best on Hard/Very Hard as it makes you use more of your tools, but I also find the jump from Very Hard to Ultra Hard to be a bit much compared to the others.

The writing is... mediocre. Many points are rehashed several times on several different occasions and the dialogue swings wildly between stock NPC templates and amusing if not interesting characters, most of which I find to be located in the DLC. To its credit the few times the game gives you a choice in how to respond it feels like the choice is actually different from the others, but they do all lead to the same point in the end.

The combat has unique systems, and a good number of monsters to fight, even with a fifth of them being some flavor of ""large cat with a gun strapped to it back"". There probably could have been a bit more variety in monster types, but the ones that do exist each have their own strengths and weakness to exploit, so combat feels more engaging than just ""hit the thing till it dies"".

First and foremost, there are a lot of things that were improved on:
- more and varying enemies
- improved area details
- more content
- improved graphics
- incredibly beautiful music
- world feels much more alive 

HOWEVER, here are my nitpicks:
- WAY too many abilities (my controller buddies will understand that one)
- parasitic game design with the abilities 
- puzzles are less creative than from the predecessor
- story is alright, however it feels like a downgrade from the story of the predecessor and doesn't make a whole lot of sense at certain points

At times it feels like the game is an Ori game in name alone. I REALLY liked the first game for what it made different from most games. I don't really understand why Ori needed weapons in this game? Especially since they feel a bit off for a character like Ori. 
Sure, Sein existed in the predecessor. Which you could technically count as a weapon. And certainly the first game had a lot of different ways to engage with enemies (stomp, throwing them into thorns, throwing glowing balls at them, throwing their own projectiles back, etc.). Perhaps I'm just thrown off that Ori was given swords, a giant frying pan, bows, spears, etc. in this game. Might just be me tho.
The sheer amount of different trees that can be found throughout the game make the trees much less special to find over time.
I remember playing blind forest for the first time and getting very excited for every tree I found. In ""Will of the Wisps"" finding trees does get tiring after a while due to the sheer oversaturation of them (not to mention all the other stuff you can find, like shards). 

I kind of wish that Ku would've played a bigger role/would've been playable for longer. 

At times it feels like the devs tried making a different game, but had to use the Ori IP for it (That's just my tinfoil hat theory tho, lmao)

If you expect puzzles like in ""blind forest"", this is not really the game for you. Stick with the first game.
This game focusses much more on combat and for that it's well done. The bosses are challenging and enjoyable (My favorite is Mora). Less abilities or a different way to implement them all would've been preferred from my point of view.
If you want a lot of bosses, play the Hollow Knight series instead.",True,0,0,1764182551

This game continues the style of the first one, with smooth platforming and a clear layout. The level design, graphics and gameplay are nice, and each area has different hazards to watch out for.

The early parts are simple, mainly teaching basic actions. As the game goes on, the paths get more complex and the obstacles become trickier.

Mess up? Boom—instant restart. And when you finish a run, it sends u right back to the starting point eliminating unnecessary waiting or backtracking. Plus, all hidden items can be collected before finishing the game, so you never get permanently locked out just becuz the story moved forward.

Why am I here?

I really enjoyed this game but there were a few pain points which makes me hesitate to recommend it to my friends. The over-arching theme of my issues with the game can be summarized with 'I don't know what to do / where to go' - I should note I went into the game completely blind having only played ori 1 so I had no pre-info about the game.

1: some mechanical kbm skill is required to play(/enjoy?) the game, but people who have the needed kbm skills will probably figure out pretty early on that some melee attacks can give you some extra air time, allowing you to bypass obstacles and reach areas you shouldn't reach. I thought I was being clever by juggling my way up ridges and plateaus or by being able to get the relatively expensive triple jump as soon as I saw the merchant, but in reality I was progressing more than I actually should have been leading me to get stuck multiple times and sometimes even having to use back-up saves.


2: fake solutions (things that seem plausible but are not the solution). Example: I used the bash ability to juggle an enemy along in mouldwood depths (they provide light) to reach a location which I thought held a secret, but it was actually part of the natural progression of the game I had to go to later. It wasn't always clear to me what was a secret and what was natural progression of the game where I really shouldn't have had access to, and boy did this happen often.
One more example would be the soup kettle in the glades, I had not been introduced to the mechanic of fanning (with the feather, like bellows) the fire of the cooking pot to get it to erupt something and I think I didn't even have the flap ability at this point in the game, as I reached this area through 'clever use of game mechanics'. So here I am spending 15 minutes seeing whether the monster has to use his axe on the floor to break the ice (plausible solution), or whether maybe I had to buy the blaze ability to melt stuff (plausible solution) and so forth. When I finally did get the instruction of having to use the fanning to get it to erupt I thought I had to redirect the fireball to the ice via bashing to break it (plausible solution) and was very disappointed when it didn't.

The most egregious one was in the ice zone and I actually had to google how to pass this, but it's where a wall of ice is blocking the final door keystone and there's a kettle nearby. Above you is a monster that erupts when you get close and shoots a projectile at you, from what I could tell these monsters are used almost exclusively to provide you with a projectile to bash off of. Now right in front of the kettle is a wooden plank on which you can stand, but projectiles pass through, and this is demonstrated very clearly with the aforementioned monster. When you drop down into it the only point of interest is a shrine that needs to be lit up, so every fiber of my intuitive-game-logic is telling me that I need to fan the pot and redirect the fireball into this area, but it just isn't working and I can't figure it out. Turns out there's a shrine much further down which had to be hit by the projectile.

3: minimap. I am naturally a bit 'lost' when it comes to navigating, both in real life and in videogames, so this isn't really a stab at the world being hard to navigate but rather about how cumbersome it is to keep having to load up the map (which takes a while btw!) to check where exactly I am and have to go. I would much rather have a sort of 'overlay' map option that I can toggle freely without it having to load.
Perhaps some sort of arrow indicator would be nice too, to remind me where I'm going (before anyone says this breaks immersion: loading up the minimap every 10 seconds also breaks immersion). I'm thinking similar to what BioShock would use.

Finally, the minimap could highlight some things better, like points of interest. In Kwolok's cave (or whatever it was called) there's a door that's unlocked by pulling a lever after redirecting a bolt to destroy a purple wall, and for whatever reason I had done all of this except pull the lever and I couldn't figure out how to open the door, I had done pretty much everything else there was to do at this point in the game regarding the main storyline and was stuck. I had to google it (which made me go 'duh, how did I miss that'), it would be nice if it would just indicate on the minimap that there was a lever there. At the end of the game when you're killing creeper hearts it shows where the teleportation funnels lead to with dotted lines, can't we have something similar for levers and things? I'm just a bit of an idiot, I need the extra guidance (although I did immediately realize what the bell music puzzle was and how to solve it, but that's probably because I played the Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus games a million times).

4. speedruns are annoying to watch
Too much menu'ing, interestingly something that plagued the first game as well and it's even worse here. I enjoy looking at different types of speedruns after I've completed the game but the menu'ing is just so annoying, even in categories which restrict menu'ing. I would have hoped that the devs (who I KNOW some of to be speedrun enthusiasts) would have added a 'speedrun' mode of the game which unlocks after having finished the game, that automatically skips things like cutscenes and prevents saving/loading (aside from autosaves like when you die in game), perhaps even has an in-built tracker (which the normal game already kind of has).

Overall this was an enjoyable game that I do not regret buying but I did find myself more frustrated than I would ideally like to have been and also far more than I have been in other types of games, and unfortunately this frustration was not a good type of frustration. I didn't feel like I overcame a challenge when I got frustrated, but rather 'I wish this was made more obvious to me' or 'oh God do I really have to backtrack that much? there's no spirit well to warp to?'

FWIW: It took me just under 15 hrs to finish the game on a blind normal playthrough at around 65% completion if the in-game time is to be believed.

EDIT: one more thing I forgot, the limited (3) ability options at the same point in time. I knew from the moment I saw the wheel of abilities with the potential spots available that at some point in time I was going to have overlap between abilities (as in, for example: I always have a certain ability on X and swap it out for another ability when needed, but now there's an area where I need both of these abilities, which means I want to press X for both of them due to muscle memory). Did we really need to limit this to 3 slots? I don't particularly care about having to swap out abilities (like swapping to regenerate to heal and then re-swapping to a damaging ability for example), but I do have a problem with the overlap as mentioned above.",False,0,0,1754827157
Octopath Traveler,1057090,7.49,0,solo,Action,76561197984933910,"This game commits a cardinal sin that immediately ruins the experience for me. It's a Metroidvania, so the map opens up as the player explores and unlocks new abilities. The problem is that, unlike Symphony of the Night or other classic titles in the genre, Ori and the Will of the Wisps lets you go incredibly far in the wrong direction before you discover you can't progress because you're missing a key ability. A better game would lock its paths behind the abilities you need for completing them. In other words, if you need the bash ability to reach the end of a hallway, a well-designed game would require you to use bash to even [i] access [/i] that hallway in the first place. It would not waste your time, allowing you to wander down the impassable hallway for several minutes, before discovering at the end of it all that you don't actually have the ability to proceed. At the very least, a better game would branch that hallway into other areas you [i] can [/i] access so you're not stuck backtracking for hours on end.

This isn't a tiny gripe. It's a key problem with the way the game progresses. Map design is absolutely crucial to a Metroidvania, and Ori has a poorly designed map. A good Metroidvania gently nudges the player in the right direction. If you discover you can't reach the path to the next boss, there's likely a route somewhere nearby that will unlock a crucial ability for defeating that boss. Since Ori never locks any of its routes, getting lost means getting [i] really [/i] lost. You start to wonder if you're going the wrong way or if you're just missing something hiding in plain sight.

A perfect example: I couldn't access an area of the game called the Wellspring. It turns out, I needed to use an ability to redirect enemy projectiles to open a door. The game never explained that I [i] could [/i] redirect enemy projectiles. It simply told me to use the redirection ability for movement, and that's all it required me to do with it for a very long time. So I was stuck for over an hour trying to get the enemy to shoot the door itself, trying to unlock a new path, and trying to find a new ability I [i] thought [/i] I was missing, all because the game failed to demonstrate the projectile-redirecting ability before it was crucial for progression. A good game teaches the player how to use a new ability in a low-stakes situation before progressing to a high-stakes one—essentially taking the training wheels off. A bad game expects the player to know the mechanics automatically, even when they aren't intuitive.

Ori just doesn't understand how game ""psychology"" works. A lot of negative reviews say the game is too hard. I disagree with that. The game is just badly designed, so it makes itself harder than it needs to be. Are you jumping incorrectly, or are you missing a power-up? Is the door ahead of you locked, or is there some secondary use for an ability you already have? Those are questions that lead to frustration. A Metroidvania should feel rewarding to play. It should be addictive to unlock new areas and create a stronger character. It should not grind to a halt every thirty seconds and leave you wondering if you're missing something.

Aside from that, while the graphics are beautiful, the main character is small, and the camera is pulled too far back. It's easy to lose sight of Ori on screen, especially when there's a light shining in the background behind him. The environments are lush to the point of sacrificing visual clarity. It's sometimes hard to tell what's an overhang and what's dangling moss, what's a thorny vine and what's set dressing. The music is fine. It's nothing special, but it fits the mood of the game and provides calming ambiance. The characters aren't the next Mario or Sonic, but they're designed reasonably well. Ori looks appropriately quick and nimble. The world looks like an illustration in a storybook, which matches the childlike nature of the plot. There are good production values here, but they're in service of an inherently flawed experience.

I knew, just by looking at it, that Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be the type of game players lose their minds over. It's pretty. It copies Hollow Knight. It tugs on the heartstrings in a Disney kind of way. But I think players are focusing on the flashy trimmings and ignoring the core game play. That core is rotten. There's too much wasted time, too many frustrating questions, and too many shortcuts taken by the developers who should have been crafting a thought-out, interconnected map. They prioritized the wrong elements and made something that is more ""vibes"" than substance.

I had zero idea how much Joy this game would be when I first booted it up.  I have tried the DEMO to Solasta 2, this will most likely ALSO be an instant buy as soon as it goes on sale after release!  The DEMO lagged on my MEDIUM END machine yet looked AMAZING.  So I MAY need a GPU upgrade :)

but, i am not my character. by virtue of this being a videogame and not an actual TTRPG scenario, i cannot pick any option in this game that would actually suit how anybody in my party would react to the situations presented in this game. nobody acts like sentient beings who have the possibility of having any internality. in fact, the game has so many ""quirky"" dialogue options that it just seems like all of the party actually hate each other and none of them want to be doing what they're doing, but the plot demands it, so they must.

the only thing i enjoyed in this mess of a game was the combat. but it is quite literally bog standard 5e combat, so it's very hard to truly fuck up. 

oh yeah, and having to pay for the DLC to get access to basic things such as the barbarian, druid, bard, warlock and *monk* classes across multiple $10 DLC packs is unforgivable. the greed is genuinely sickening.

The characters look rough. They look like they were created by someone who only had access to five polygons and a hangover. Every time I made a new one, I thought, “I don’t think I should be seeing that many cheek angles.”

Early on, you fight a lot of Sarkas. Or Sorkas. I don’t know, man. They’re like discount doppelgangers that look like Koopa Troopas who lost their health insurance. They fly around, stay outta range, and make me wish I’d rolled a character who specialized in doing something fun.

You only get three male voices to choose from. I had four dudes in my party, so I had to reuse one. Now I got two guys who sound like twins who don’t get along.

The game’s got crafting. And guess what: the best gear comes from crafting. I hate that. That’s like finding out the best food at a restaurant is the ketchup packets.

The early areas are a lot of walking, not much fighting. I didn’t sign up to be a pedestrian, man. The most fun I had was fighting a random necromancer and his skeleton crew. That felt classic. Everything else felt like waiting in line for that fight to happen again.

But everything else was mid at best, voice acting was hard to listen to for some voices, dialogues came in flat, I did not get emotionally invested to the plot or characters back stories. Gear was okay to figure out, there were not that many options but it was enough to figure out a build or two. Graphics were eh, I was not impressed at all with character creation it felt like the options for making characters were 'ugly' and 'less ugly'. 
Now my absolute biggest gripe with this game in the DLC purchases needed to get in IMO content that should have been included. I'm completely fine with the DLC being exclusive to different stories/ areas/ etc but freaking locking away normal 5e PHB races and classes it absurd and greedy.

Overall – Blasphemous is a haunting blend of tough combat, stunning pixel art, and deeply atmospheric world-building. Playing as the Penitent One, you explore the bleak land of Cvstodia, an environment overflowing with twisted religious imagery and beautifully crafted, unsettling detail. The gameplay leans into deliberate, Souls-like combat. Every swing feels weighty, every enemy demands attention, and bosses are memorable, punishing, and incredibly satisfying to overcome. You’ll die often, but each attempt teaches you something, making progress feel genuinely earned. The story is delivered through cryptic dialogue and environmental clues rather than straightforward exposition, giving the game a mysterious, poetic tone. It’s the kind of world that invites you to piece it together rather than giving you answers outright. If you enjoy challenging Metroidvanias with rich atmosphere and art that sticks with you, Blasphemous is absolutely worth playing. Highly Recommended.

Here's the most frustrating characteristic of each point:
- platform usually requires high precision, i.e. if you don't jump exactly at the border of a platform, you won't grab it but instead will fall through it;
- exploration doesn't give you clues about where to go next so, every time you beat a boss and complete an area, you either look on the Internet or have to go forth and back in every single part of the map, until you find a new area you can access (and, of course, being a souls-like, this not only takes time but it's also annoying because enemies keep re-spawning);
- all enemies deal damage just by contact, and with punishihng hit-boxes (like, being close to a still enemy is equivalent to getting smashed by a hammer).
  This is not only another source of frustration both while doing platform and exploration/navigation, but also results in added frustration while fighting, in having to calculate not to end up too close to an enemy after an attack, and sometimes in not having a single safe point in the screen, when it's full of enemies.

Does your slide have i-frames? Yes and no.
You can slide through contact damage but not attacks or projectiles.

You won't know until you actively attempt to walk into them.

Where does the player's hurt box and collision box start and end?
This is particularly bad with the jumping animation where he raises his legs making him appear like the protagonist is jumping higher than they actually are. Combine that with similar shenanigans for enemies and it's a guessing game for where you will take damage.

Platforming feels awful combined in tandem with harsh punishment for failing it. The only saving grace is that their timed platforming challenge courses don't result in real deaths. . ., but that doesn't stop them from feeling bad and clunky.

The controls and the level design are just bad, I don't really know what else to say. It's a shame, because the art design and the lore seem genuinely interesting. The arbitrary difficulty of this game just makes it plain not enjoyable. Most of the time it feels like you're dying because of the game design and the controls, rather than your own mistakes. 

I've also had a myriad of issues relating to controls with both controller and keyboard/mouse. Sometimes when you die playing with a controller, the game stops recognizing any buttons during the death screen, so you have to press a key on the keyboard and then all your inputs go back to KB/M. Even if you continue playing like that, since the game still recognizes the controller, it turns out the Dodge button doesn't work, which leads to yet another stupid death. You then decide to play with KB/M (spending some time in the control settings to remap things) and then think that you're good to go and enjoy the game when you pick up an item and realize you can't scroll the text in the item description, but you can with a controller.

Yakuza Like a Dragon,1121910,0.0,0,solo,"Casual, Indie, Simulation",76561199184821242,"This is a *real*, officially licensed, completely free dating sim where your main objective is to:

* Attend culinary school
* Make life-changing choices
* And romantically pursue a bishonen anime version of Colonel Sanders, who has more abs than menu items.

Not a parody *of* KFC.
A parody dating sim **by** KFC.

---

### Pros

* 100% free, which is good, because you’ll need that money for actual chicken afterward.
* Genuinely gorgeous anime art. Everyone looks like they escaped from Ouran Host Club and fell into a deep fryer.
* You’re a culinary student at the “University of Cooking School: Academy for Learning,” which is the most legally safe fake school name ever written.
* Cast includes:

  * Hot Sanders
  * Your supportive bestie
  * Evil rivals Aeshleigh & Van Van the Man Man (yes that’s his name)
  * Professor Dog, who is an actual dog in a little chef’s hat
* There’s a secret ending, “secret recipes,” and dramatic “cooking battles” that feel like Iron Chef on a marketing budget.

---

### Cons

* Steam tags say things like “Souls-like,” “FPS,” and “World War I” because the community is unhinged. Please ignore them.
* Choices “have consequences,” but most of the time the real consequence is Colonel Sanders being slightly disappointed in you, which honestly hurts more than a game over.
* Actual dating content is pretty tame; it’s less “thirst sim” and more “branding exercise with sparkles.” Critics were… not impressed. Players, on the other hand, are just vibing.
* You *will* finish it and realize you just emotionally invested in a man whose primary character trait is “11 herbs and spices.”

---

### Peak Colonel Experience

* Trying to give a sincere answer in class and being out-performed by a literal cooking robot named Clank.
* Getting genuinely nervous about impressing Sanders with your mashed potatoes.
* Replaying scenes to optimize dialogue like: “If I pick the wrong line, will he *not* franchise with me?”
* Credits roll and you close the game… then immediately google if anyone has actually cosplayed this version of Sanders. (They have. Of course they have.)

When I first booted up I Love You, Colonel Sanders!, I expected something campy, absurd, maybe even weirdly charming. A branded dating sim starring a hot anime version of the KFC mascot? It’s a wild concept — and in theory, a great setup for a parody or tongue-in-cheek experience. Unfortunately, once the initial novelty wore off, I found myself stuck in a painfully shallow game that feels more like an extended advertisement than anything resembling meaningful entertainment.

Visually, the game does a decent job. The character art is polished, and the overall aesthetic embraces the overly dramatic tone of anime dating sims with enthusiasm. But once you get past the surface, there’s not much there. The writing leans heavily into absurdity, but rarely in a way that feels smart or subversive. Most of the jokes fall flat, relying on randomness or self-awareness without actually saying anything clever. It’s quirky for the sake of being quirky — and after ten minutes, the charm runs out.

Worse, the “dating sim” mechanics are practically nonexistent. There’s barely any player agency or branching narrative to speak of. Choices feel inconsequential, and the story rails you through a linear path with little room for exploration or interaction. You’re not really playing a game — you’re reading through a branded fever dream with a couple of flavorless choices tossed in to justify the format.

And let’s talk about tone. For a game so fixated on parody, it’s weirdly toothless. It doesn’t parody dating sims so much as copy their structure and coat it in fast-food references. There's no critique, no clever twist — just KFC product placement wrapped in anime tropes. The whole thing feels safe, corporate-approved, and strangely hollow, like someone tried to be ironic without really understanding the genre they’re riffing on.

I don’t mind games being silly or promotional, but they still need to respect the player’s time. I Love You, Colonel Sanders! is all concept and no follow-through. Once you get the joke — “Haha, it’s Colonel Sanders but hot!” — there’s nothing else to latch onto. No gameplay depth, no meaningful story, no emotional engagement. Just a long commercial disguised as a game.",False,3,0,1753755753

I’ve seen walkthroughs at the very least so I know what happens in them I guess.

I say all of that just so you know I’m obsessed with NieR. It is my favorite video game ever and this one feels the best to play. I like the post apocalyptic setting and story the most. I also have a soft spot for anything involving robots and androids (being a huge Ghost in the Shell fan). You can customize the characters in a ton of different ways to play however you want and there's nearly endless replay value. The music in this game is breathtaking.

Runs smooth, amazing visuals, responsive and like zero glitches or oddities. PS4 and Switch are fine with Steam being the worst.

Dont Starve,219740,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",76561198027758678,"It's creepy, chaotic, and WAY more addictive than I expected.

Don’t Starve surprised me with how well it blends whimsical art with grounded survival mechanics. The atmosphere is incredible, the survival loop is addictive, and the game still holds up after all these years. Combat is the weakest part, but everything else pulled me in. For the price, it’s absolutely worth it.

The Good:
• Amazing Tim Burton-style art and quirky tone
• Strong survival loop with great early-game pacing
• Realistic mechanics that actually matter (fire spreading, sanity, sleep)
• Weather, darkness, and nightfall create genuine tension
• Lots to discover and experiment with
• Time flies, easy to get absorbed

The Not-So-Good:
• Combat feels basic and predictable
• Early sanity confusion until you understand the system
• Building in a 2.5D space can feel a little awkward
• Requires trial-and-error before things start to really click

Final Verdict: 7.5/10

One of the better survival games out there if you like creepy whimsy and grounded mechanics. Combat needs work, but the atmosphere and loop are excellent.

At full price ($11.49 CAD), it’s easily worth it.

Combat always feels like an uphill battle because it feels like no matter what strategy I try using, I'm doing something wrong and getting hit HARD by the enemies. This became tedious and annoying when exploring and going back the screen I was just on like 5 seconds ago just to find out that the enemies reapawned, and they're a pain to avoid! I've played so many JRPG type games but the combat system just wasn't clicking for me. 

I also just couldn't get into the humor or be bothered to care about the side characters. I dunno, maybe it's because I played Deltarune so much only a couple of months before this game and I intentionally and unfairly compare the 2 of them - of course this would seem dull in comparison to that game for me. 

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. The combat in concept is a really fun idea and the story seems interesting. Overall it was just too meh for me to want to continue. 

I would probably still recommend this game, but there's one really annoying flaw that I experienced while playing it that I can't forgive. The issue is simple yet big enough to have a negative impact on gameplay for multiple sections of the game - THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SO DANG DARK. I encountered a section where you're alone in a dark house, and I almost thought my system was frozen because I could barely see anything. This resulted in me fumbling around in the dark and extending that section of the game by like another half hour longer than it was supposed to take because I just couldn't see where to go. I tried everything I could think of involving messing with brightness, contrast, gamma, docking it to my TV, etc. It seems this is not an issue unique to me, because I found a couple of forums concerning the issue and none of their propsosed solutions worked. I guess this was the case for a couple of other people on the forums because they quit the game too since there are multiple dark sections of the game they didn't want to deal with lol. I just don't see how the devs haven't fixed something so glaringly obvious and annoying after all this time that the game has been released. I would've considered returning this and purchasing it on the Nintendo Switch but I already went over the 2 hour play time and couldn't return it so I didn't want to waste my money again 🙃

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561199090438594,"At first I recommended it. Now I don't. Gameplay-wise, there exists both the dream world and the real world. That's not what the game actually calls them, but it's what I'll call them. Each world has ""sequences"" to them. You cannot explore the entirety of the dream world before the real world, and vice versa. The first sequence of the dream world seemed decently engaging enough, where the rules that the game establishes for itself not being set in stone, and each interaction and fight feeling new and fresh. This maintains itself in the first sequence in the real world, where I was able to explore it and find all the connections between it and the dream world. And then after that...the rules have already been established, and the game doesn't particularly deviate from it, if at all. And those interesting parallels aren't really drawn anymore. So it's just a long, repetitive...well, I wouldn't say slog. But it isn't particularly enjoyable.
 Story wise...there is a twist that completely sours the story. A part of me doesn't want to reveal the twist, but then again, if you don't want to play a game again simply because you know the twist to it, what's the point of the game, really? In short, I can't sympathize with manslaughter. You, the character, have committed a criminal act. If not involuntary manslaughter, then staging it to look like a suicide certain doesn't help things, either. And THEN the main character and the character who helped you stage the body feel bad about it? They feel bad about losing a friend? Would it have killed them to, I don't know, call for help? Instead of staging it to look like a suicide? That's what a friend would do! Get their friend help! Now, I haven't actually reached the end. I've just seen enough spoilers through the community of this game to have found that out. And that twist just completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. Getting so attached to some characters in a movie, show, or video game just for it to not resolve in a fulfilling way...you know, closure...that's one of the greatest sins a piece of media can commit.

-This may fall under me disliking RPGs, but I really wish there was no/a higher limit on the number of saves you can have at once.
-Interacting with stuff is weird. Sometimes you need to press and hold, and sometimes it wont let you close out after a single tap. I would look at the bathroom mirror for 0.1 second (because you need to press and hold) and then be forced to look at that one photo in the bookshelf (not exactly a fan of that or that one unskippable boss's design btw [boohoo], but this last bit is an opinion also)

Honestly this game is dying and it's killing me to admit it :

- Queing/Matchmaking will play with your nerves because of dodging and server errors. Today again I queued for 15 minutes to get a RM. 
- Servers and Codebase are pure trash, and I'm not even exagerating. Constants drops, players crashing (and stop saying it's because of potatoes PC, High end Configs crashes too). 
- You can't get back in a game after a crash, so it's instant GG. 
- Players crash is happening all the time. Looking at my history on insights, there's about 1 on 2 games that last between 1 and 5 minutes because of players dropping out of the game.

NEVER play without sound. The indie soundtrack is GOD tier. I get chills every time I listen to any of the songs either from this or the prequel.

Life is Strange,319630,0.0,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198969781032,"Before you read this review - if you're considering buying this game because you're looking for a good ""choices matter"" game with incredible time travel mechanics and attention to detail, and you haven't played Steins;Gate, definitely buy Steins;Gate instead, no questions asked. If you've already played Steins;Gate and you are looking for something that has some of the same types of themes, I guess this game kind of does... But be prepared to lower your expectations. A lot.

This game had a lot of potential and I was pretty intrigued after playing through the first episode... But then once I started playing the DLC episodes I realised pretty quickly that even though it constantly tells you ""your choices will influence the past, present, and future, choose wisely"", none of your choices actually have any real impact on the story. Whenever you encounter a choice that seems like it should have a significant impact, you can pretty much bet that whatever character is affected by the choice has already completed their role in the story by that point and won't really be mentioned much for the rest of the story (regardless of which option you picked).

One thing I did like about the game is the rewind mechanic. It is implemented really well, and there are quite a few good puzzles that make use of it. Unfortunately, this leads me into my next complaint, which is the abundance of bugs in the game that range from slightly inconvenient to pretty infuriating.

One of the most annoying bugs in this game is that the camera constantly locks up. I think it has something to do with ""examining"" something and then immediately trying to move the camera after closing the examine screen. It will lock your camera in a specific direction and make it impossible to look around for a while, and then after you walk around for long enough the camera will eventually fix itself (usually). And then there are a couple of sections where you can get locked in the rewind screen without any way of escape and you have to restart the section and go through everything again. Also something is glitched with the textures, it seems like the characters sometimes have multiple layers and one of the layers sometimes halfway glitches and they get super pale or something. Fortunately that one is pretty easy to ignore because the graphics are already bad enough that you don't really notice. Not that bad graphics really detracts from the overall experience, which is obviously a lot more narrative-driven than something that's meant to blow you away with visual fidelity.

Then there's the plot. The time travel stuff is pretty interesting and there are some genuinely clever ethical dilemmas that arise from it, but the setting really wasn't for me. Most of the characters are annoying (which makes sense I guess because they're all teenagers at a private school) and there's a lot of swearing for no good reason. And the main conflict is just weird, and doesn't seem realistic at all. Also, I grew up in Oregon and THERE AREN'T ANY FIREFLIES. I guess that's a nitpick, but that immediately broke what little immersion there was for me, lol

Anyway, I wouldn't recommend paying $20 for the DLC even if you played the first episode and enjoyed it. Your money is much better spent on something like Steins;Gate.",False,1,1,1762556626

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The game world can be quite spectacular to behold. Inquisition takes the foundation of DA1 and DA2 and expands it immensely. The locations you visit are varied, from ancient Elven forests to sandy deserts to stormy coasts, the locations are different enough to where the biomes don’t get repetitive and even have some throwbacks to DA1. Furthermore, the exploration and interaction are good. Each area has tons of collectables and lore entries that teach the player about the area and where it fits into the history of Thedas. 
Perhaps the big negative thing to point out here is quantity over quality. I would have preferred if there were actually [i]less[/i] zones with a greater emphasis on each zone being deeper and more meaningfully designed. Because while they are beautiful to behold and can be fun to explore, fatigue is very real and remembering the nuances of each area can be more difficult than it should be. 

The narrative is okay. It’s a typical “Big bad trying to destroy the world” type thing, but I think the setting and characters elevate the narrative to greater heights. 
As for the DLCs, Jaws of Hakkon is forgettable, The Decent is better, and Trespasser is probably the best bit of story content in the game, shame the best parts only last ~20 minutes. 

[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The mechanics are decent, but I feel that largely it is a step back in depth from DA1 and more inline with the gradual streamlining of DA2. The prior games had a unique take on Dungeons & Dragons, while DA:I feels much more shallow. It’s kind of like going from something like Final Fantasy X to FF XV - yes, it's prettier and faster and cooler, but the RPG mechanics suffer. Gone are any sort of stat-based conversation options, the character progression is simplified, and even abilities can feel very boring and shallow. The game does open up a bit when you unlock your classes' specialization, as some of those kits are fun and work very well with the base classes, but I still can’t help but feel an overall theme of having less RPG mechanics in an RPG game, which is a big negative for me. 
New to DA entirely (I think) is the crafting. This can help to customize your character's gear, especially if you don’t know where the best drops are or if you are simply unlucky. 

The difficulty is generally fairly easy, especially as you level up and unlock better gear and more talents. I played on Normal, and it was a tad difficult in the beginning, but by the time I unlocked my Knight Enchanter specialization after about ~12 hours, I was blowing things up.
One thing I did enjoy is the addition of “Trials” which are optional difficulty increases. You can choose to add elective difficulty increases for some small increased awards like additional loot. Things like having enemies level with you (which is how it naturally was in DA1/DA2) or even an option to turn bears into mini-boss gods. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The graphics are very PS4-era, and while they do age pretty well for a ~11 year old game, certain things like animations can be very stiff and reflections on metal surfaces appear just awful. Still, I think this is a great looking game for its age. 
Probably the worst area graphically is the menu UI. It definitely feels like the focus is on the console versions because the UI is just awful to use with a mouse and keyboard. You have to constantly do things like move your mouse off and then back onto an item to get the tooltip to display. 

On the technical side, the game is not good. I experienced multiple crash to desktops and many bugs when my game simply wouldn’t load, and I had to alt+F4 to the last save. Even aside from technical issues, I ran into gameplay bugs where my characters would stop using abilities, or I couldn’t pick up items on the ground. I had to reload often to fix them. I even ran into bugs where essential characters seemed to have fallen through the ground and was missing all their dialog, essentially ruining the quest.

[h1] [b] Audio – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
I found the audio to be good. The music is largely forgettable, but there were a few iconic songs that are great. 
Voice acting is top-notch and awesome. 
I did encounter many cases where the audio simply stopped working. From combat to dialog, no sound. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]
I think there is some decent replay value here - you can choose male or female, different races, different classes, and different romances as well as a few quests that have some slightly different outcomes. The game is pretty linear, but the choices can definitely warrant multiple runs. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Dragon Age Inquisition (DAI) is the THIRD game in the Dragon Age series. I highly recommend you go and play the first and second, as they have aged fairly well and are great experiences. Now that you’re here and thinking of diving into DAI what can you expect and how does it compare to DA1/DA2? 

DA1 has a very dark setting full of intrigue. It’s full of solid RPG gameplay that is parallel to Dungeons & Dragons. DAI does not largely have that. DA2 seemed like a step-down from many of the things that made DA1 so great, but it’s still a good RPG. I feel like DAI is on par with DA2 in that it's decent, but streamlined so much that player choice suffers. 

What DAI offers is a massive open world within the Dragon Age universe, like you’ve never seen it before. I want to make it clear that massive does not mean good. DAI has a clear problem of quantity over quality. You can easily burn dozens of hours doing fetch quests and other random pointless crap that serves no narrative purpose other than to increase your “Points” that you can then spend on unlocking more zones to do more pointless things that give more points…DAI is a nice 40-hour RPG adventure wrapped up in an 80-hour game. 

It’s not all bad, though. I would say the best part is the story. That 40 hour story is pretty good for about 20 of those hours. Especially the DLC, Trespasser. If Mass Effect’s sendoff was anything to go by, BioWare is very good at doing epilogues for their games and where it ends immediately makes you want more. Also, I have to do a shoutout to the great characters. It’s a pretty great cast of characters with their own personalities. Sera is my elfy wife. 

Overall, yes, I would recommend DAI. I think it's an okay game. Fans of DA1 and DA2 probably shouldn’t miss it. 

[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]
[h1]Yes[/h1]
$40 is steep for an 11 year old game. $10 sale price though is very good for the amount of content you get, and if you can get it for the historical low of $4, VERY worth.

[i](This review contains no story spoilers btw!!)[/i]

[b]-Overview-[/b]
Developed by BioWare, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a massive fantasy RPG that blends real-time combat with tactical strategy. Players take command of the Inquisition, leading a diverse group of companions to restore order to a fractured world. With hundreds of quests, beautiful environments, and meaningful choices, it delivers an epic adventure, but it is also heavily built on the foundations of the previous two Dragon Age games, and newcomers may feel they’ve missed major pieces of context.

[b]-Story & Characters-[/b]
[i]A strong, engaging story, best experienced after playing the first two games.[/i]
 Inquisition’s narrative is well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and packed with political drama, divine conflict, and moral decisions. However, the game relies heavily on world events, character arcs, and choices established in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II. Returning characters make cameos, past decisions impact present events, and major story threads continue directly from earlier titles.

For players who haven’t experienced the prior games, much of this depth risks feeling distant or incomplete. The Dragon Keep system, which lets you import or manually reconstruct past choices, helps fill the gaps mechanically,  but not emotionally. Reading about choices you never made or characters you never met is a poor substitute for having lived those stories yourself. This is one of the few RPGs where your personal history with the series genuinely matters, and missing that history can lessen the impact of major scenes.

As a first-time Dragon Age player, it’s easy to feel like you’re walking into the third act of a trilogy without having seen the first two. The story is still very good, but you’ll constantly sense that you’ve missed meaningful context, relationships, and payoffs. If anything: I wish someone had told me to play the first two games first. I would have enjoyed this story far more if I’d brought my own choices and experiences into it instead of relying on presets.

Companions are well-written and offer solid banter and personal quests. Their level of involvement is similar to Fallout 4: they’re memorable and distinct, but their presence has less influence on the core story than companions in Mass Effect or Dragon Age: Veilguard.

[b]-Gameplay-[/b]
[i]A complex combat system that becomes satisfying once mastered.[/i]
 Combat can be overwhelming early on, especially for players new to managing AI tactics and switching between party members. Over time, though, it becomes one of the game’s strengths. The mix of real-time action and tactical pausing allows for careful planning or fast-paced brawling, depending on your build. However, people who aren’t new to this type of combat system will find themselves bored with the lack of builds you can make with your character. Still, I found it to be quite enjoyable, regardless.

Character progression is exceptionally well-paced: you begin fragile and unsure, but grow steadily stronger through skill trees, specialization classes, and improved gear. You cannot brute-force enemies above your level, they will flatten you, but the game fairly challenges you within your tier.

Exploration is vast, and each region feels alive with wildlife, secrets, side quests, and collectibles. The sheer amount of optional content is impressive, though some zones can feel bloated with minor objectives.

[b]-World Design & Visuals-[/b]
[i]One of the most visually striking RPGs of its era.[/i]
 The landscapes are vibrant, diverse, and grounded in strong artistic direction. From snowy fortresses to lush jungles and windswept deserts, each region is detailed and atmospheric. The world feels alive and lived-in, and the lighting and environment design remain a standout even today.

[b]-Music & Sound-[/b]
[i]A solid soundtrack that shines in key moments.[/i]
 While the score is not consistently memorable on its own, it elevates major scenes beautifully. Music swells during emotional peaks and blends seamlessly into exploration. Voice acting is strong across the board.

[b]-Length & Value-[/b]
[i]A colossal RPG with well over 90 hours of content.[/i]
 Even a focused run takes dozens of hours, and completionists can expect significantly more,  especially with story DLC. At its frequent sale price, it’s excellent value. However, this isn’t necessarily a good thing, as by the end of the game, you start to get bored exploring all these different zones and doing all these different fetch quests, and at some point, you just wish for the game to end.

[b]-Replayability-[/b]
[i]Worth replaying only if you want to see major branching outcomes.[/i]
 The game offers multiple endings and many impactful choices, but each playthrough is a major time investment. Most players will likely complete it once and revisit it after a long break.

[b]-Summary-[/b]
Dragon Age: Inquisition is a richly developed RPG with excellent world-building, strong narrative arcs, and satisfying character progression. Its size can be overwhelming, but its story and environments are worth the time, provided you play the first two Dragon Age games first.

For newcomers, the Dragon Keep system cannot replicate the emotional weight of decisions you never made or relationships you never formed. The game is filled with callbacks, cameos, and payoffs designed for long-time fans, and much of that will be lost without experiencing the earlier titles.

[b]Highly recommended, especially after completing Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, which will greatly enhance the story and make Inquisition feel like the true saga finale it was designed to be. 9/10 game, not surprised it’s won game of the year before.[/b]",True,0,0,1763751839

Despite how good Dragon Age Origins was, no amount of nice lore and storyline helps me tolerate the obsessive amount of grinding in this game that does not know if it wants to provide a good single-player experience or to be an MMORPG with offline servers.

Dragon Age Inquisition is the product of a new design philosophy that spits on the memory of Dragon Age Origins by diverting the player from its previous narrative-driven and consequence-driven logic to an open-world design with vestigial elements from a logic of microtransactions in pay to win games.

Of course there are no microtransactions in Dragon Age Origins, but we all know that blocking quests behind real wait times (like in the war room) are only used by game developers to force players into paying to unlock these sections of the game faster. By blocking quests merely for the sake of it under hours or days, the developers brought a vestige from the microtransaction systems of P2W games, and this is not the only instance where Dragon Age Inquisition is more akin to an MMORPG than to a good single-player RPG.

But what is so wrong with this new design philosophy that Bioware has adapted? That it breaks the narrative of what Dragon Age is.
Dragon Age Inquisition is the story of a person who seems to have been touched by divine power, surviving an explosion with a mark that provides the key to bring the world back into order from beaches that allow demons to cross from the fade to Thedas. It is the story of a person who becomes the public face of an organization tasked with saving the world. It is a story of urgency, the breaches won't wait for the main character to have a field trip before they come to save the world.

Yet, the game design gets everything wrong:
1. Despite the narrative emphasis that Dragon Age has always exhibited, every actual plot moment seems to be blocked by hours of constant grinding and filler material.
2. Every combat has lost all its meaning and it's now nothing but filler. Every enemy is an HP piñata ready to waste your time even in the easiest difficulties. And not even in the sense of being difficult, just in the sense of being unnecessarily long.
3. The open-world zones destroy all sense of urgency and of pacing, letting the player roam to the most irrelevant places.
4. Most of the side quests are filler content that lack any connection to the player's status as the Herald of Andraste or even any relevance to their mission. Yeah, you can make people be more favorable to the Inquisition by helping them do menial things, but that is not the job for the person who is in charge of closing the breaches. The open-world design forces the player character into an errand-runner, but they are not an errand-runner. They are the Herald of Andraste!

Thus, all these are symptoms of a game design philosophy that does not suit the narrative of a Herald touched by almost divine power. The open world logic forces a dissonance where, despite the urgency of the situation and the role the main character plays in the great scheme of things, the player is invited to waste its time doing everything but the engaging with the main plot. Its vast open-world zones interrupts the pacing and drama, its excessive amount of filler combat distracts from the actual point of the story and its new system of side quests excessively reliant on letters (instead of actual interesting interactions with real people) does not add to the real plot. We've gone from a story-driven game to an open world with the vestiges of microtransaction logic bringing about a degree of dissonance that just destroys the entire experience. Going to a new place like Val Royeaux does not feel anymore like advancing the plot, but like just opening a new can of worms with more irrelevant chores to complete. This game may be great for grinders and completionists, but it does not feel at all like a continuation of Dragon Age Origins.

But this, is not that. This is just one tragedy right after another, almost all caused by a certain apparently incredibly racist demographic. That's the message, a certain demographic is evil and racist and this game attempts to show you first hand just how treacherous and cruel the world is for anyone outside of that demographic. So if you love  political messages being shoved down your throat, this is the game for you.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of the dialogue is unskippable, none of the characters are likable, all just victims of the racist and religious evil doers with their own uninteresting stories of how they're also victims. This results in being forced to sit through literally hours of boring dialogue from people you just do not care about in the slightest.

I'm gonna be honest, I've put this review off for quite some time but I feel like it's now or never because I want to put this game behind me and never engage with it again.

Just like with the other titles in the Life is Strange series, I bought this game on release. I've played it on both PlayStation and PC as well as watched content creators, YouTubers, streamers and friends play through the game. I'm sure I've squeezed every bit of content I can out of this game and explored most if not all options. My tldr; it's the worst thing that's happened to the Life is Strange franchise.

To those that know me, it's no secret that I genuinely despise this game. I hate the fact that they took such a beautiful story concept that was Life is Strange (2015) and decided to turn it into a political issue and add forced religion as the cherry on top. 

Don't get me wrong, I think these are very important issues that definitely needs to be addressed, I just hate that they used Life is Strange as the platform to do it. 

Going into this game completely blind, besides seeing teasers and trailers and what the developers had shown us online previously to playing it, I was genuinely interested. I thought it was going to be an emotional journey with intriguing characters to meet along the way just like previous games but was quickly severely disappointed. 

I think my absolute biggest grudge with this game has to be Daniel. I'm not joking when I say I would put him among some of the worst, most annoying characters I have ever seen in any video game. Worse than Ashley Graham - Resident Evil 4 (2005). Worse than Navi - Legend of Zelda. Worse than Paimon - Genshin Impact. 

Not even one hour into the game and I already wanted to leave this runt in the middle of the forest to starve by himself. The dialogue, his actions, his thinking-it was all like nails on chalkboard and I couldn't stand him. The constant lying, betrayal towards his own brother, the god complex he portrayed because of his powers and his need to put others down made me have to unwillingly battle through any content throughout this game that had Daniel involved.

""But he is a child, they make stupid decisions!"" I hear-yet whenever we see other children throughout the franchise they're not HALF as ignorant or dumb as Daniel is. 

""He lost his father, he is dealing with trauma!"" Loss is a massive part of this franchise and it doesn't justify ANY of his poor thinking or unjustified actions throughout the game.

I've seen the praise that brothers Diaz get from others that love this game and I'm happy they have characters they're so fond of, I've accepted the fact that I don't like Daniel and I never will.

The other characters you meet along the way are ""okay""? I guess.. Some of them stick out more than others and you have short moments where you get to explore them more and learn more about their story and their life and it's honestly the part of this game that I enjoyed the most. Sitting by a campfire together, drinking beer and sharing stories of past trauma or exciting events was moments where I felt the most engaged with this game. I think it's this games strongest asset but also where they missed a core opportunity for great writing. There are moments where you meet characters who are intriguing and who have genuine care for you and your brother and who offer well needed help in time of need. Only for the game to throw these characters away never to be seen again. Shout-out Brody. You won't be forgotten.

My second grudge with this game was the ENTIRE CHAPTER focused on a religious cult. 

It's like they asked each other in the office previous to making this game and brainstorming how they could make Daniel even MORE unbearable. By slapping a religious sticker on his forehead and FORCING the played to interact with it. The entire chapter as a whole felt like a chore, your saving grace is meeting your long lost mother Karen (Voiced by the amazing Jolene Andersen, aka. Ada Wong - Resident Evil) and trying to patch up their broken relationship. Yet nothing felt more justified than setting the cult's home ablaze and leaving this horrendous chapter to burn to ash (literally).

So was there any parts to the game that I actually enjoyed? Yes. Of course there was. I give credit where credit is due. Being on the run and seeking help from long lost family or strangers gave a feeling of unease and caution but also a sense of warmth and trust at the same time. Bonding with the introduced characters was great, along with music that's iconic for Life is Strange games, though I felt a slight step down from previous titles, still great tunes to get lost in.

Something I will give this game praise for is it felt like they finally landed that sweet spot where puzzles felt natural. Something I gave previous titles some bad score for because of it's misuse of puzzles, I was glad to see LiS 2 finally managed to get it right. 

In conclusion I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they are looking to complete every title in the series, I feel like this game can easily be avoided or watched online. I wouldn't suggest someone to buy this game even on sale, though definitely pick it up for free or play it if it was gifted to you. I'm sure there are many others who will love this game and give it praise that it's known for.

Minor bugs were present though nothing near other titles. I was happy to see that.

All in all it's another addition to the LiS franchise and another episodic, decision based story game to get lost in for anyone looking for games matching this criteria.",False,2,0,1761503418

An abundance of idiotic one-hit-kill mechanics coupled with limitations to saving that lead to having to do boring shit over and over again (a couple of the fights are really unreasonable to boot), the lack of any (!) character development, the worst/most uninteresting loot/equipment system I've ever seen (and with the spectre weapons you can get before the halfway point being the best in the game, all further weapon looting is pointless – and so are the millions of accumulating credits you can't spend on anything because there is nothing worth buying! this isn't even amateur level game design, it's retard level!), boring-as-fuck levelling which is completely unbalanced as well, psionic abilities all seem to do the same thing (namely, hindering your opponent for a few seconds – I can't tell a difference between them at all!), the abominable balance of main and side quests (speedrunners must love this though...), unskippable cutscenes, many, many bugs... and, most direly, the total and utter failure in the RPG aspect as you cannot choose even your own words (!), much less anything else between generally good and vaguely evil... and it's beyond reason itself, as predecessor Knights of the Old Republic was infinitely better in each and every single regard, and DA:O which came afterwards in almost all regards!

EDIT: Game 2. Oh boy! There is more character development in the first 30 min than in game 1, but the actual gameplay is so much worse I simply cannot believe it! Only 4 to 6 things to level instead of some 15 (!), you can't specialise in weapons, the actual shooting feels way worse, the first (!) group battle is already next to unwinnable (and I did beat game 1 on hardest difficulty...), health refills are gone apparently (or I cannot find them) and to top things off, I cannot figure out how to fucking map the quickslots (which I never used in the first game, as I was able to map the weapons to keys, WHICH SHOULD ALSO BE THE CASE HERE!). Fucking shit, the sniper scope doesn't even line up with your line of sight, LOLOOLOL.

I cannot believe how hard they fucked up the gameplay compared to the already not very good first game! No inventory at all, four or five skills to level, no specialisation in weapons, still no feedback whatsoever – you are literally not told whether you hit an enemy or not, and what hits you in turn (even though the latter isn't as important as you can't protect yourself against different kinds of damage, OBVIOUSLY)! No way to boost your abilities in something like the insane garage fight (complete with the biggest video game sin that exists, infinitely respawning enemies – and that's against very limited ammo!!! Hell, after this shit I'll never complain about a game having infinite ammo again!), hell, the fuckers even took out health potions altogether!!!

With that out of the way, honestly to me the Trilogy's narrative doesn't hold up at all. 

The first game is great and establishes the world and a solid vibe game. The only complaint I have is that the companions are a bit vapid, but the game still rocks. 

The second game sidelines the entire first game and elements established within. The first game established the Trilogy's main antagonist, how much of a threat they're going to be, and how the galaxy needs to start preparing now. What's the second game about? Oh human colonies are going missing and a human terrorist organization is using Shepard to investigate them. At least that would be the plot if the main meat of the game wasn't spent on making sure your companions' family troubles aren't resolved. The focus on the small bunch of characters takes away from the greater universe and the impending doom that will need to be resolved in the third game. 

Imma be honest, I've played Mass Effect 3 before and trying to play it after 1 and 2 is a huge tone shift that makes the game feel like it's not a Mass Effect game. Unfortunately 2 set up 3 in a bad spot and it shows from the start. ""Oh no, the doomsday threat we were warned about in the first game is here! You know, that giant ship that basically required a whole fleet to take one down is now here in mass! What will we do?!"" Then Liara shows up with the blue prints for the Deus Ex Machina device and a point system that will determine if Shepards lives or dies in the either the Mountain Dew ending, the Mountain Dew Code Red ending, or in the Mountain Dew Voltage ending. But along the way, you get to rush by and resolve everyone else's problems because they wouldn't let you do so in the 2nd game due to babysitting duty. 

Overall, the launcher is cringe, the first game is good, the second one is fun but derailing, and the third is just a different game trying to fix everything.",False,0,0,1763400851

ME1 - Fun third person RPG Shooter with depth for the story and gameplay Completed on Insanity nearly 100%.

ME2 - Awkward arcade hide and peek shooter that continues the story from ME1. It is a significant downgrade gameplay wise. Working on first play through on Insanity, but it simply is a worse game than ME1.

Long story less long:

ME 1: This is one of the best shooter RPG games I have ever played. Even though the graphics may be dated, the story is worth playing with good gameplay to back it up. The attention to detail in the world interactions rivals and beats games released in 2025. 

From social interactions that have implications later in the story, to physical interactions with the world, ME1 feels like a full game worth playing.

I would recommend giving it a try if this is on your backlog.

ME2: It is alright - very similar to ME1, but there are differences. The gameplay is such a let down after ME1, it feels like some exec who didn't even play the first game made some changes on how the fundamentals work by stripping a lot of the core gameplay from the game:

1.  There is no inventory system & you cannot swap weapons/armor during a mission.
2. They managed to make the maps & navigation worse and less useful in ME2. Can't even access the ground map during a mission. ME1 you could access it and place a custom marker at any time.
3. Weapon selection is limited and upgrading weapons is completely different.
4. They took the ability to crouch out of the game. This SIGNIFICANTLY limits how you can play the game compared to ME1.

 In order to crouch, you have to be directly in front of cover and it is not a true crouch, more of a duck and cover.  

Example why this is bad: I am standing, but the wall in front of me across some cross fire, could protect me if I could just MANUALLY CROUCH to hide from the enemy. In order to crouch, I have to go through cross fire that is currently blocked by a wall that will not provide protection if I crouch against it...but it is protecting me against the crossfire.

UnFun fact: You cannot crouch against every wall, anyways.

5. Sprint, Take Cover, Action/use are all mapped to same button.
6. You auto heal outside of combat, you do not use medi-packs to heal anymore.
7. They changed how weapons work in the universe, slightly. No longer do you have enough energy to run your weapon over the time the story takes place, but you now have depletable ammo. Ammo replaces the cooldown mechanic. 

This puts organics another step back from [spoiler]the Reapers[/spoiler] technology wise.

It was fun sneaking around in ME1, slowly moving around corners and peeking for shots. I hope manual crouch is brought back in future games...

I can see why people do not like Mass Effect 2. It is a stripped down version of ME1, with better graphics. The ""it does not feel like as much of an RPG as ME1"" comments are warranted. It doesn't.

7. Also, they made bypassing circuitry just... a hidden puzzle matching game...

All in all, my only motivation for 2 is to finish the story, but I think I will just uninstall and read the lore online.",False,0,0,1763325448

You need to download EA's app to play the game at all, and if you don't make an account and log in then it will pop up every time you boot your PC up pestering you about it (even when you haven't loaded up Steam yet, never mind tried to play the game). There's no workaround for this, far as I can tell... and I did look.

I've only touched ME1 and I've had problems with the game progression. There's barely any tutorial, I keep having to look up how to do basic things like holster weapons and heal. Load times are meh, graphics are worse than I expected for a modern remaster, but that's fine, I can forgive that.

But the BUGS. My god. I was prompted to write this review by the fact that I just barely got past the ""prologue"" section of the game and immediately hit a game-breaking bug (cannot access the galaxy map, and therefore can't... do much of anything, I'm stuck on the Citadel).

I'll try reloading an old save and give those cutscenes another run-through, but this really doesn't bode well for the game overall. And I'm not eager for the experience of playing a game constantly worried that I'll be softlocked behind some random bug which makes my save unplayable.

The game itself, in terms of story and gameplay and so on, seems like something I could've been very into if I'd played when I was 14 but I can't say it feels especially engaging to me now. Still, I would've stuck with it if the game would actually work. Not sure if I will now. I'm not sure it's worth the effort. Shrugs.

It's hard to call this an adventure game, and 13 years on I'm a little impressed at how this title managed to win over even die hard adventure game fans. Mix 'n' Mojo forums was positively ablaze over it. But on reflection, I don't really get it.

We would later discover that this game was also the death knell for Telltale. Its industry veterans were thrown into the licensed IP meat grinder and churned out, over the next handful of years, riffs on the same formula: walk, dialogue, cutscene, 'choice'.

I can’t avoid the fact I fundamentally don’t enjoy zombie settings. I thought Telltale’s Walking Dead would be the game to finally turn me around - after all, it’s rated so highly that it seemed superficial to me to write it off so easily. I love the episodic narrative-based format, and I especially love a tear-jerker. See my adoration of Life is Strange.

My problem with zombies is the fact they’re [b] such a boring [/b]enemy. By their very nature, they have near zero intellectual power, making them the most mentally unchallenging enemy to fight. The best villains build tension by outwitting the main character. But Zombies are entirely predictable. They have no personality or character traits, they can’t give any dialogue or communicate in interesting ways. They’re just spammed ad infinitum and thrown at survivors.

But zombies aren’t considered the real enemy of the zombie genre. Instead, it’s people’s inability to work together which ultimately leads to their deaths. But this means pedantic infighting, petty drama and miscommunication take centre stage, which is incredibly frustrating to endure. It’s like when you watch a horror film where each character leads themselves to their deaths due to their inability to communicate. 

The Walking Dead is centred around both of these cliches, and while I won’t argue it introduces a few other ideas too, it ultimately revolves around petty arguments between the majority of the characters. I know there’s some fondness for the art style too, but character’s faces are so comically exaggerated that it feels like a kid’s cartoon at times. The cell-shading doesn’t feel like a choice motivated by a strong artistic identity, but rather a practicality of a low budget. The game’s story themes are dark, dreary and depressing, so this Borderlands-esque look works at odds to this.

The puzzles feel less about figuring out the problem, but instead talking to characters and engaging with items in a prescribed order for it to eventually trigger your character carrying out the solution. I do appreciate some of the decision-making, and I genuinely like Lee and Clementine, it’s bogged down by the petty and childish supporting cast. Also, the game’s climax is ruined the moment you open the game because of the Steam community integration. This means under the “Play game” button you see scores of memes and artwork relating to the game’s final moments, ruining the emotional impact completely.

I won’t argue this review is unfair, since I don’t enjoy the fundamentals of the zombie genre, but I did think The Walking Dead might be so good as to make me overlook this. Sadly, this wasn’t the case.",False,2,0,1756577653

[i]SOMA[/i] is a first person horror game with clever philosophical depth and profoundness. This is achieved with a few trivial yet somehow awfully meaningful choices along a gripping journey through a bleak underwater research facility. Splendidly voice-acted protagonist Simon ([b]Jared Zeus[/b]) and his acquaintance Catherine ([b]Nell Mooney[/b]) provide their own opinions but leave room for the player to think.

SOMA's weakness is the lack of gameplay mechanics: it is a walking simulator with slight puzzle and stealth elements. Replayability is almost nonexistent due to that. But for one playthrough, the game does provide an immensely immersive 10-hour experience. The physical interactivity of objects -- pushing and pulling doors, grabbing and throwing stuff -- makes the game world feel tangible.

Certain sections with a monster can become frustrating if you get stuck on repeating them. Fortunately, in a post-release update, [b]Frictional Games[/b] added a Safe Mode option that stops the monsters from hindering your progress.

There's enough quiet time to ponder these themes in between the monster encounters, most of which I found genuinely scary. The challenge of the game is basically to keep your nerve and figure out the monster's behaviour - short puzzles under emotional pressure. I think you'll be missing out if you use safe mode. 

There are also several more relaxed puzzles without any monster stalking you, which I found interesting and well-judged in terms of difficulty. I felt like I really could be the protagonist, trying this and that until something works. I also really appreciated that the game felt like a real environment, with lots of spaces and objects that aren't relevant to the player. I find this adds a lot to immersion. Furthermore, there are no stupid easter eggs or steam achievements for exploring every inch of the map. You can actually behave like you would if you were really in this world, instead of running around like a maniac looking for dopamine.
 
The story is excellent and very original. Not only that, I'd call it anti-formulaic.

After pushing through several hours, I’ve had enough.

I’ve played my fair share of complex, puzzle-heavy survival horror games, and this one isn’t challenging, it’s just poorly executed and painfully repetitive gameplay.

The first hour hooked me with its atmosphere and story potential, but once you’re thrown underwater, the experience falls apart. Low visibility, sluggish movement, and maze-like areas where you wander aimlessly for hours with no sense of direction; not fun, not scary, just exhausting.

It’s a shame, because there’s clearly a good story buried somewhere under all this frustration. But good narrative design doesn’t excuse bad gameplay. I’ve played walking sims before, this one just happens to be the most boring one pretending to be more than it is.

Waiting for an elevator to go down, waiting for a vehicle to reach the destination, waiting for the game to load, wait for the audio log you triggered to finish because the game doesn't let you walk around while listening to them like every other game did since system shock 1 in 1994, waiting for a globule of doom to decide to finally hobble away, waiting for your character to crawl along an endless passage, wait for the character to incredibly slowly climb up a ladder (game fails the ladder rule), waiting for the endless expanse of ocean to finally lead to the next story module. The game should be like 4 hours but it's 10.

A horror game shouldn't have me intentionally running at 200mph towards the enemies you are supposed to avoid because i am tired of spending 30 minutes creeping around to avoid them when i can simply be punched in the face by them and get knocked out at which they automatically leave to a different part of the map.

There are sections of the game where the game tells you to do something but that something gets you killed anyway ""follow the lights"" if you follow the lights the monsters still kill you anyway and you have no way of hiding from them properly in that section so you just repeatedly get attacked anyway, so pointless.

Also, the concept of not being able to fight an enemy is unrealistic. A human can stab literally anything with an improvised spear and with enough conviction they will kill it. Welcome to being human we've been doing this since we lived in caves. (Yeah I don't care if the MC is technically only partially human in this game you know what I mean)

In short this is a walking simulator with like 5 puzzles in 10 hours. The story is good but the game is not. Also, the ending of the story sort of lives and dies on the idea of a programmer not understanding cut vs copy which I think would be the simplest of concepts for someone designing robots that contain human consciousness to understand.

DEVOUR plunges players into a frantic co-op horror experience where teamwork, panic, and quick thinking are the only things standing between your group and a terrifying cult entity. Each map feels like a self-contained nightmare, requiring coordination and courage as the tension escalates with every ritual item you collect.

The game shines in its simple yet effective co-op design. Working together to find items, manage resources, and dodge the ever-growing aggression of the possessed leader turns every match into a chaotic thrill ride. Communication is key—splitting up can mean faster progress, but also guarantees hilariously horrifying moments as someone gets dragged into the dark.

Atmosphere and pacing are major strengths. Each location—from haunted farmhouses to burning asylums—offers distinct threats, secrets, and environmental storytelling. The sound design ramps up fear at all the right moments, building suspense as the demon’s behavior evolves and the stakes rise.

Progression and replayability keep players coming back. Difficulty settings, unlockable cosmetics, and new maps with unique mechanics ensure that each run stays fresh. The unpredictability of enemy behavior and the frantic scramble near the end of each round make DEVOUR consistently exciting with friends.

Final Verdict:
DEVOUR is a fast, frightening, and wildly entertaining co-op horror experience. Its escalating tension, distinct maps, and teamwork-focused gameplay make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer scares and chaos-filled sessions with friends.

“Terrifying, frantic, and endlessly fun—horror co-op at its most chaotic.”

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198052380519,"This is one of those games where the first 20 hours or so are very addicting as you learn to swim in an ocean of content and struggle with balancing your economy with logistics and raids; but once you understand how to swim in the ocean, the mechanics all feel really flat and repetitive. Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.

The good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.

Visually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.

My gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.

The combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.

As many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.

Overall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",False,2,0,1764008930

Starting a next run you're gonna be doing the same limited set of actions you can do to build your city. I have exhausted all variation quite shortly. I feel claustrophobic and lonely, it feels like im playing an empty husk of a world. Let me explain several independent thoughts I have which I'm conflicted about. These are only a few examples to explain a small portion of my feels.

Several mechanics and rules just live in the wild online as myths and mysticisms: what for, and how to use the wagon shop for example. Of course that's not the only one, as there are several other ones that are just not declared by the game so you kinda have to guess and hope it works like you want. Reading reddit comments and forum posts of other people's thoughts on what they believe the mechanic works like. There are several annoyances in the game that keep piling up at the back of your mind as you build your city and you get to know the systems of the game. Some examples:

The upgrade and proximity system encourages you to just cramp things together and make grids. It often comes down to ""do you want a pretty town, or do you want to survive?""
We want a pretty town of course, thats the game's appeal. But in the back of your mind this annoyance is always going to be there.

It's great that you can set a max limit for resources, so that villagers can quit that job and enter an other one. But this isn't true for all jobs: farmers, healers, soldiers are assigned to their duties and are still busy standing in their job title. There is no downside to unassigning them while they are not useful. You can also just let them be, which is what I do: but it's still going to be an annoyance in the back of your mind.

The reason for my dislike isn't concretely these 2-3 examples. It's the overall feel, for which I have provided these examples. This feel, while the game is in early access is fine, but not as a full release at full price: Which is how I encountered this game the first time. I gave it enough playtime for me to doubt myself, because I did have doubts, maybe I just didn't understand the vision or the game.

My ultimate verdict, as of 1.00, is go play songs of syx if you want a challenging city builder.  If you want a cozy city builder, this game is for you on the lowest difficulty.

I say this as someone who plays on vanquisher.

The game is fundamentally flawed on what makes a city builder engaging for those looking for difficulty/challenge 


Logistically this game is extremely lacking in complexity, even though on the surface it may not appear so.  Villagers are completely incapable of handling distances, despite the existence of wagons.  

There is no simple button of ""only allowed wagons to transport"" a resource.  Villagers will walk half way across the map to a node, to grab 2 ore, instead of waiting for a wagon to deliver.

You can get gamey with it to try and force it, but to me a city builder has failed on a basic level when you are unable to set such simple limits.

Second, the tech tree suffers from the same problem.  It may appear to offer depth complexity, but that is far from the truth.  Technology mostly exists to speed bump your city and its expansion by locking previous buildings behind tech.

There are glimmers of interesting ideas in the tree, active policies that trade benefirs for penalties; but they are mostly ineffectual or extremely strong to the point where the downside might as well not exist.

The cyberware feels half-baked, the perk system still feels like a first draft, melee feels basically unusable at higher difficulties, the writing is either pretty decent or just abysmal, a lot of the quest design is pretty boring and underdeveloped, the main quest ends right as it seems like it is about to get really interesting, and the city itself feels flat. It's got a lot of pretty buildings to look up at, but there is basically no meaningful verticality that the game plays with. At full price, I can not in good faith recommend the game. 

Phantom Liberty is a little better, I would probably rank it independently at around a 7/10 or maybe an 8/10, but that is mainly just because the writing and quest design is better and a lot tighter than the main game.

Movement is a little too floaty, feeling similar to ARK.

I know it's Early Access, but holy moly is this ever rough around the edges. A lot of basic tutorials that you'd expect to get are simply not there, and the AI is pretty much ""run in straight line and attack, repeat"" for every enemy- which can still be difficult because enemies are often just spammed at you from spawners you can barely see and any attacks from behind count as backstab, even for enemies. So an enemy you didn't even know had spawned behind you can one shot you.

Which brings me to my next major gripe:  Darksouls style artificial difficulty.  Some traps and even simply existing in some areas will INSTANTLY KILL YOU. With no warning or indication whatsoever. The worst being the Shroud itself. The game doesn't tell you there are multiple ""levels"" of shroud, which to the player just looks like fog. There is no distinction between levels apparently. So you can be walking through shroud and be fine, then simply touch a higher level shroud and just instantly die. Insult to injury is that the game flashes a message on your screen warning you that you're IN a harder shroud area. *After* you are dead.

Being a caster is kind of a joke, as staffs require mana AND ammo, which is a huge pain in the ass to get mats for early on. Then there's the game's automatic target locking. You can't freely aim, you are stuck locking onto enemies and it can seriously screw you over if you're trying to shoot a barrel next to an enemy because. While I only found out later you can hold T and it will cancel target lock but only while holding T. There's permanent toggle.

I will say, the story is by far the strongest part of this game. I also really like that the devs tried a new spin on the genre, by adding interesting movement abilities. However, the levels were a bit too simple to really let these shine (even when backtracking, these abilities were used in pretty simplistic ways). 
The combat was okay, there were only a couple of weapon types (though they came with different special attacks, they were largely the same). The enemy variety was good considering the short runtime. 
The combat overall was really easy even w/o the assist mode. The bosses were a letdown - they were incredibly easy, and didn't really have any moves or combos to worry about. Also, their attack hitboxes were *really* bad - a lot of them you could just hug and they'd not be able to hit you with most of their attacks.

It is typical of a dark souls type of game with steep learning curve and monsters that respawn after each death or interaction with saving point.

In other games, where monsters do not respawn after each death and saving point, I usually play on adventure mode, like the step above story mode, but never hard core mode. I get tired of the unending grinding of games like this, where your progress don't mean shit if you havent reached a saving point. Killing 50 monsters just to die to the boss, and then having to kill them all again, is not my idea of fun.

Big plus that they have added ""assist"" mode so you can play more as in a story mode or similar to enjoy the game more, avoiding the unending grinding and actually be able to finish the game, even as an average player.

1. The game is a walk in the park... For calling itself a soulslike it is way too easy. I actually did every single boss first try except (ironically) the very first one where i died once cause i wasnt familiar with the movement of my own character. At the whole 12 hour run I only died 3 times even though im by no means a god gamer... im a soulslike fan so i actually enjoy getting my ass spanked by a hard game which this game sadly could not deliver the slightest.

2. The maps all look similar especially the first 3-4 big regions so it is too monotonous for my taste. Got a bit better to the end of the game but the start was too equal looking.

3. Mob recycling is crazy in this game... Holy shit there are actually only like 5 types of enemie which get recycled throughout the whole game by getting a different weapon or element but basically still being the same enemy.

4. As mentioned earlyier its too pricey for what it brings to the table. I would say a fair price would be 20€ but would strongly advise against buying it for everything above that price.

I spent a lot of frustrating time looking for a way to adjust the controls without saving and quitting before I realized that ""save and quit"" was some imbecile's way of saying of ""save settings"".

Everything else here is here to fill the page. This is a highly derivative game in a saturated class of games that I am sick to death of.

The idea is honestly fantastic. You’re in this alternate version of Paris where robot soldiers patrol the streets and the city’s in chaos. It sounds cool, right? It even looks cool at first. But it gets boring fast. I'm tired of the boring AF DS tropes/mechanica and lack of imagination in how the game works. Soulslikes need to come up with a way to feel different. This one doesn't. Not that many do. And (as usual with what seems like all soulslikes) also plays like crap on PC, and was clearly only really intended for the console audience. I have a PC interface. USE IT. I'm sick of tabbing through items and other assumptions of a controller-only setup. I'm just not interested in playing anything anymore (period) that doesn't take advantage of the fact that I have a proper set of PC input devices at my disposal.

The combat never feels quite right. Everything feels a bit floaty, like your attacks don’t really connect. Enemies are mostly the same few types repeated over and over, and the boss fights just drag on forever. There’s no real excitement to them, just a lot of health bars and awkward timing.

Exploring the city is kind of boring too. The areas look nice but they all blur together. It feels like you’re being guided through narrow paths pretending to be open streets. You keep looping back on yourself for no good reason, and the rewards for exploring aren’t worth it anyway. The world just feels empty. Pretty, but dead.

Performance isn’t great either. The game stutters sometimes even on a good PC, and the animations are stiff. The story wants to be deep and meaningful but it’s so flat that it never lands. Everyone talks like they’re reading lines off a script, and I stopped caring about the plot halfway through.

It’s a shame because there are moments that almost work. The designs of the machines and costumes are amazing, and the first time you see the city on fire is genuinely striking. But that makes it worse in a way, because you can see what the game could have been.

In the end, Steelrising feels like a beautiful idea that never made it out of the prototype stage. It’s not awful, but it’s not fun either. It just kind of clanks along until you give up.",False,3,0,1761510073

I've been through like 3 or 4 levels and I can already feel the enemy reuse.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198047984519,"Steelrising sounds like such a great idea on paper. Imagine an alternate history version of the French Revolution where King Louis XVI actually manages to defeat the revolutionaires with an army of clockwork automatons. Even better, you yourself are a former dancer-automaton named Aegis, tasked by Queen Marie Antoinette to find your maker, Eugène de Vucanson, and eventually fight your way through Paris to stop the King himself.

It’s an amazing premise, and having visited Paris a number of times I was excited to see how developers Spiders would bring this alternative history version to life. Unfortunately, a great concept cannot make up for unimaginative and repetitive level design, poorly-implemented combat, terrible optimisation, and a level of jank that is difficult to put up with.

Let’s start with the good stuff. You do get to see a handful of the capital’s iconic locations, including Versailles, Notre Dame, La Louvre, Les Tuileries and, of course, The Bastille, even if once you actually get inside you discover they all share a very similar set of assets. I enjoyed the different historically-inspired clothing here as well, and those that enjoy a bit of fashion souls can find plenty of tricorne hats and frilly shirts to suit their fancy. There are only seven main bosses in the game, but they are all fairly different, with interesting move-sets that need to be learnt to beat them. Finally, the map to travel around Paris is a nice touch too, rendered as a piece of old parchment.

Unfortunately, that’s more or less where the good stuff ends. I disliked Aegis’s move animation immensely. She’s either walking far too slow, or running far too fast in a disjointed, weird-looking sprint. Jumping is finicky and imprecise, only slightly alleviated by some extra traversal moves you get later into the game. Combat is strangely unresponsive : I often got the impression my character would dodge a second or so after I pressed the button, and the hit-boxes are very strange, with both my weapon and the enemies passing through me without either of us getting hit. 

My weapon of choice, the trust halberd, has an almost laughable range, and you can thrust at enemies that are three or four meters away, with Aegis seemingly getting rubber-banded to their location. In another instance, I stun-locked a miniboss with a series of heavy attacked which meant he never touched me at all. 

There are your traditional soulslike stats and weapon upgrades, though nothing particularly innovative apart from an overheat system that never really bothered me. What did bother me was the succession of drab, uninspired Parisian streets that made up most of the game, occasionally replaced by repetitive gardens and hedge mazes, all with the same gates, benches, and statues. This isn’t helped by the fact that a lot of the game inexplicably takes place at night. It’s such a shame because Paris itself is a wonderful place, and with a larger budget or a bit more imagination we could have had some vibrant, colourful locales similar to what the team developing Enotria The Last Song managed to pull off.

The story is intriguing enough, but gets a bit lost in its own convoluted lore, and despite including real historical figures like Robespierre, Necker, and Lafayette, is dolled out mostly during scenes where three of four NPC monologue at you until you are eventually sent off to complete another quest.

Lastly, I will touch briefly on the many bugs I encountered, three years after release, including several hard crashes, textures not loading in properly, or, perhaps the most annoying, a loss of focus after using a “vestal” bonfire which meant everything suddenly looked way too blurry. 

I was really disappointed with Steelrising, as its concept was so promising and other games such as Lies of P have shown how fun it can be to take cultural elements from our own history and change them in new and exciting ways.

You can't expect a masterpiece or even a very memorable experience, but it is a fun experience. If that's enough for you, then get this game. I played this game almost every day with my brother back in 2020-2023 on the PS5. I have over 600 hours on this game over there.

There's plenty of content in this game now after all the updates to keep you engaged for as long as I was.

Here's probably something more important for most people: why I stopped playing Fallout 76 for a while. I believe the only reason I was able to play this game every day without getting tired was because of Fallout First. Like Elder Scrolls Online, the subscription gives you an unlimited stash amount that is required for long term enjoyment. Even though I didn't craft so many things to the point I needed all that space, it just cuts out a significant amount of frustration. There's already too much micromanagement and menuing in this game that I hate. Adding more by requiring me to stop playing and drop all my junk items and ammo so I can sprint again is astronomically stupid. I already spent more on this game than any other game I've ever played by paying for Fallout First for 3 years. That's $300 + $40 (PC version a few weeks after launch) + $10 (Xbox version a year after launch) = $350. I never buy microtransactions or subscriptions for any games. I play 100s of hours of Call of Duty and progress the battle pass, all without paying a dime. I can ignore $50 skins and $20 battle passes that only give emblems and calling cards with a couple double XP tokens mixed in. I don't excuse any of that nonsense, but I can enjoy the game with it. This game is an exception for me, and all the money I've paid isn't enough for them (the developers / publishers). I truly can't enjoy this game without Fallout First. I love scavenging and collecting things in the open world. Dropping them all the time makes it feel like a waste, and there's not enough storage space for non payers. The more I talk about the game's bad business practices, the less I want to recommend it, so I'll stop here. Just know that I could go on. I could go on and on and on...

This game is pretty great and should be an easy recommendation to anyone who just wants to play something with their brain off while they watch a video or chat with their friends. It provides a casual experience where there's always something to do, but you can stop whenever you want. The biggest flaw that completely drives me away is that the game doesn't want me to play unless I'm always paying. Other games provide a playable experience for the base price of purchasing the game, but not this one. If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time recommending this game without a massive caveat. Honestly, the only thing that got me into this game as much as I was was playing with my brother. I enjoyed so many experiences I had with this game in all the years it's been out, but I can't get that anymore without continuously paying. I'll pop back into this game occasionally to try new content, but it never holds me for long. It's just sad that it has to be this way. This game is capable of standing alongside the other live service juggernauts but holds itself back needlessly. 

I'm only writing this review because of the Steam Awards, but it really let me reflect on the kind of game this is. I have so much more I could say, I mean I probably have close to 1000 hours of playtime across Steam, PS5, and Xbox. I just don't think anyone will read this on a 7 year old game with over 40,000 reviews. I guess if what I said is interesting enough to others, I'll come back and write more, but I've already spent enough time writing what I have. I hope anyone reading this understands where I'm coming from with this review. I doubt I'll be changing anything in the games industry with this, but I just wanted to say what's on my mind. Games can be better. So much love, care, and passion is poured into these 100 million dollar projects that it's such a shame to take all that away for a quick extra buck. But I know nobody does anything for free, and money has to be made at some point. The truly talented people are able to place that barrier in appropriate spots. If I could take this game offline and play with mods, I would easily add 100s of more hours. As it is now, though, as it was designed... I'm just sad.",False,0,0,1764091152

In it's way, it's art. An absurd, weird, gross, horrific and original 3D first person rogue-like horror. First runs can feel senseless, but little by little most of the game world will make sense.

While working through my games backlog, I like to pace myself by playing one fairly ""normal"" game and following that up with something weird as hell. [b]Golden Light[/b] falls firmly in the latter category; however, what started as a very intriguing premise would turn out to be a bit of a disappointment.

In Golden Light, our unnamed protagonist descends into the depths of the Gut searching for She, his lost lady love. Here, the Gut serves as both the environment and the antagonist, becoming angrier and more hostile the more enemies you kill. And if you find it all too much to bear, you can always appease it by hurting yourself or making offerings…

From what I saw, the story in Golden Light closely follows the Silent Hill ""formula"" (or at least, what's been accepted as the Silent Hill Formula over the years): our protagonist is lost and trapped in a purgatory-like place, searching for a loved one. This fairly well-worn base is then topped with a generous smattering of meat and weirdness (with a sprinkle of Cronenberg and Lynch), giving Golden Light a unique and genuinely unsettling vibe.

Look, I'ma be real - I'm not a huge fan of games whose idea of horror is enemies barrelling down towards me, screaming bloody murder. And since this is basically Golden Light's main shtick, I think you'll understand why I dropped it so quickly.

If you're OK with constant, annoying jump scares, I think there's actually something to Golden Light. The meat aesthetic alone is unique enough to merit at least giving it a try, and for all I know, the story might go deeper than the surface-level stuff I saw would suggest.",False,2,0,1756381812

Moment to moment gameplay here is mostly scouring the floor you're in, looking for keys which will give you access to the next floor, while avoiding traps and enemies (and combat), and collecting resources that can all be used in multiple ways. Got a consumable? You can either eat it or throw it at enemies to trigger status effects. Got a new weapon? You can either use it (with very poor control and damage in general), throw it (for status effects) or eat it (?) as well. Managing these resources while deciding when to engage in combat is the core to the game, and it took me almost four hours to really understand it, since it's a very obtuse game (and unashamedly so).

So, if you want a run and gun game, this is not it. This is a much more cerebral and cautious kind of game. Buyer beware.

Outside of the 'dungeon floors' you have a hub world that is as weird as the levels, and even after beating the game I'm still confused as to how to navigate it. There's certainly a proper way, an optimal path, but I have absolutely no idea what it is.

Now, I didn't love the gameplay, and hence is why I wouldn't recommend the game. But one thing that it gets absolutely right are the vibes. Visual design, sound design, enemies, environments, loading screens and transitions, everything is super well alligned to the vibe the game wants to convey, and there's something really satisfying to see gel together.

Story-wise it was very generic, boring and isn't the strong suit of this game.

But the reason for the negative review is that the experience is sullied by the absolutely horrible port.
Before even starting the game, opening the settings in the launcher almost crashed my PC and caused the fans to go crazy.
So I never touched that again, but it continued inside the game in the form of massive frame drops and freezes even in cutscenes and also crashed multiple times.

On top of that I've encountered some of the most random bugs such as subtitles stop working on a specific mission, camera won't open on a mission where you need to take pictures or not being able to continue after solving a puzzle and having to restart the game.

Addendum: I already completed the game yesterday but they seem to have released a minor patch to fix a bug with button combinations today, though they still haven't touched the others I've seen which when I googled them I found out some still exist from the PS4 version release.

Either wait until this is heavily discounted or just pirate it.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,23.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual",76561198095708276,"Seeing how this is: 
- the 2nd highest selling PS4 game of all time: 
  -- especially how late during the console's life-cycle it was released
- Spider-Man 2 is the highest selling PS5 game of all time
I thought I would have nothing to lose getting it. I bought it via a CD key and took the risk; which excludes it from Steam's refund policy. 

But this goes to show, that, both mass critic and user reviews, cannot be relied upon as it is mostly generated hype and cult followings, favouring style over substance.

This game unfortunately falls into the generic Ubisoft sandbox. The map is huge, but there is little ways to interact with the world. The people walking around are nothing but cardboard NPCs, and the buildings are just blocks for you to swing off. There are no interiors and few unique charms that make exploring the city worth while. A denser, more alive open world with more content would have done this world favours.

The physics and controls are pretty tight. Spiderman has a varied move-set and the combat is somewhat similar to Batman Arkham series, where you have to perform timed dodges, deal with enemies wielding melee or ranged weapons, shields etc which means you have to spin a different combo to deal with them and not mash the same buttons. That part works, what doesn't is the overall game-loop. 

- the graphics are not that great, older titles like MGS Phantom Pain look far more stunning
- there is no day and night cycle or changes to weather - they do change based on story script only, so if you are just exploring, the world feels static, not dynamic.
- the side-quests are just generic activities:
  -- wave fights: (personally I think this is one of the lowest forms of gameplay, to program it you just need a simple loop of enemy respawns and triggered conditions). The particular waves in this game get very tiresome, it isn't a matter of skill, but endurance.
-- crimes: a bit better than endless waves, short and sweet, but nothing special. Vehicle chases means swinging after a vehicle, then pressing some Quick Time Events to watch a few animations.
  -- collectibles: backpacks, pidgeons etc. simply means gathering them. There isn't a skill based challenge or a gadget themed puzzle requiring you to get them. Reaching the pointer on the map and grabbing them is enough
  -- Ubisoft towers (really dated legacy mechanic most people are tired off, interact with a tower, reveal portion of the map)
  -- photographs landmarks (there are a few unique buildings, you just pull out the camera and snap a photo)
- full of mundane progression minigames - if anyone remembers Bioshock's Pipe-Dream hacking minigame, well this is back, but in the form of electric circuits. I never liked minigames, I just want to play the game, but when you have to repeat the same minigame over and over it gets stale and repetitive very quickly. In contrast to Arkham, those games require you use your gadgets to interact with your environment, where as here you find detached minigames that don't at all link to Spiderman or any of his tools. 
  -- Luckily, accessibility options do allow you to skip them entirely, which I did gladly.
- Skill trees: in the 2010s era every exclusive sandbox had to have the 3 skill trees: tap A to do this faster; take less damage;  something affects 1 more enemy etc. - quantitative checkbox updates rather than quality updates that affect how you interact with the world.
- enemy AI is not dynamic and reactive like in Arkham, they won't start destroying perch points once they see you them. They will behave in the same manner throughout
- The MJ and Miles sections are scripted, linear stealth sections. You cannot change how its done or pick your own route, you go from point to point as you're told and cannot deviate from this line.
- I don't know why so many devs obsessed with cinema do this, but if you want to explain a narrative, just add a cutscene. Instead you will be stopped with many sections that require forced walking, you walk around a room, and press the action button to interact with an object, the character speaks some monologue about what you saw, then you have to repeat this several times until you have interacted with enough objects/the correct object. Again, I just want to play the real game, save these interaction sequences for cutscenes, don't force me to hold ""up"" for 5 minutes pressing ""Y"" to move the game forward.

The pluses are:
+ lots of different suits, gadgets and suit mods to modify your play style
+ controls and physics feel tight
+ web slinging feels tight and controlled
+ map is large
+ lots of Marvel characters make an appearance

Overall I really find it hard to understand how this outsold, especially so much later in the console's lifecycle, much more dynamic and innovative titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and MGS Phantom Pain. The game mostly borrows all of its mechanics from other titles, but doesn't contribute anything innovative of its own.

My recommendation is to buy this from Steam directly, that way if you don't like it and played under 2 hours, you can refund it - this will give you ample time to test it, as what you see in those 2 hours is what you will get throughout. Or try to see if you can play a demo version. 

If you find yourself that you are not tired of generic open world games like Assassin's Creed and many other Ubisoft titles, then you can probably sink into this. But if you strive for quality and innovation, try the demo before buying (or buy directly from Steam, and request a refund in under 2 hours). To me a lot of this is very last gen, if it came out in 2012 it would have been top tier, but even Arkham City outclasses this game and has a more unique variety of activities in its sandbox, despite having a much smaller world. And that being said, I also think that most Ubisoft sandboxes are actually a lot more fun than this game, even AC Odyssey whose map is far too large and has literal fetch quests offers more thrills.",False,5,0,1762982330

	I've sunk over a thousand hours into 7 Days to Die over the years, a testament to how fantastic this game [b] used to be. [/b] The core concept of a voxel-based zombie survival crafting game is brilliant, and for a long time, it delivered some truly memorable experiences. The issue is that the game I fell in love with is not the game it is today, and the developers (""The Fun Pimps"") seem intent on a cycle of endless, often regressive, change rather than refinement.

	My lack of recommendation comes down to one core problem: the developers constantly redesign fundamental systems from the ground up with almost every major update. Instead of building on existing mechanics, they scrap them entirely, forcing veteran players to re-learn a ""new"" game every single time. This isn't early access refinement; it's a lack of vision.

    • [b] Scrapped Mechanics: [/b] We've seen multiple iterations of progression systems, from the ""learn by doing"" model to the current perk and magazine-based system. Each change feels like a sideways step, often removing depth and features that the community enjoyed (like empty jars or specific meat types) for no apparent reason other than change for change's sake.

    • [b] Forced Playstyles: [/b] Recent updates have introduced systems like biome progression tied to loot stages, which can feel linear and removes the open-world freedom that was a hallmark of earlier alphas. Base designs and creative building approaches that players developed over time are often patched out, forcing specific, developer-approved play styles.

    • [b] An ""Eternal Early Access"": [/b] After more than a decade in Early Access, the game still feels unpolished in many areas, while basic, long-promised features like bandits or robust NPC systems remain missing (though competently implemented by the modding community). The recent 1.0/2.0 updates have only amplified these frustrations, adding poorly implemented features like the annoying storm system that just waste time.
	
     I got my money's worth, absolutely. But I cannot recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state, nor can I endorse the development philosophy. If you are looking for a stable, long-term survival experience that consistently builds on its foundations, this isn't it. The game is a revolving door of concepts, and you never know when the mechanics you enjoy will be completely removed in the next patch.

It's unfortunately out of necessity since they ""vaulted""/deleted half of the story rather than having the story unfold as the player experiences it.

Additionally the vaulting of content is the dumbest thing ever. It's 2025 and they haven't figured out how to add content without needing to subtract content. Meanwhile look at other free to play games like Warframe which continue to improve on the new player experience and add new content while keeping old content completely 100% playable. Every change is either an addition or something that genuinely was better for the game.

Destiny 1 was the better game and it's a shame we never got a PC port. Destiny 2 needs to improve the new player experience and return the vaulted content. If it did that it would be a genuinely good game. The gameplay is solid and the story has a lot of potential, but until those things are fixed this is not a good game and it is not worth giving this company your money or your time. I hope Bungie gets their act together but I'm not gonna hold my breath for that.",False,0,0,1764146822

Destiny 2,1085660,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",76561198119713857,"After the sunsetting, Destiny went downhill. Most of us stuck around to see the end of the saga. With ups and downs, when they launched The Final Shape, we tought they would come back and be what the players wanted. We were very wrong.

Destiny used to be a unique game. ""Planets"" to visit, amazing campaign, well written villains and characters in general. With some teaks here and there, some QoL changes (like Lfg, loadouts and subclasses 3.0), legendary campaign for the old ones (Red War, CoO, Wm and Forsaken) and also, some changes of bosses mechanics would make Destiny a desirable game to play. Now it's just menus and cards (Portal), content we paid for is gone for good, new locations are not that interesting and not worth visiting. When Destiny was ""not so good"", even Mercury were packed with players. 

Now i feel that i don't even need locations to go and that's one of the reasons that made me quit Destiny. You could just chill in IO, Titan, Mercury or Mars. You could chase the meta or just play the game the way you want. We had fun, now Bungie is a generic company.

I felt robbed when they sunsetted the content we paid for but i stuck cuz the narrative was good and we still had some uniqueness to the game. Now we don't.

Maybe i will come back one day and edit this, saying that they gave us back what we paid for, but i highly doubt and that just makes me sad, because i really miss the ""Journey"" that Destiny used to be (yeah, the feeling of the game and the best music they made)

If somehow they come back with what we deserve, i will be the first to be around. Until then, i will just reminisce on the good times i had and how used to be fun to just be playing Destiny outside the menus.",False,0,0,1764127564

Bungie should have walked away in 2020, while people were still applauding. But they insisted on milking it dry for profits and Pete Parsons very basic taste in classic cars.
I discovered Destiny in those years when Borderlands 2 had grown stale as yesterday's bread. And one boring day in school,  before me opened a pure greatness of game universe, that is a cathedral of a game design. A space western without tacky laser cowboys. Futuristic industrial design – sublime, functional, memorable – fused with magic that felt real and harked back to magic lore and mythology of our real world.
The first cracks on facade and mold in the basement appeared in Season 8. Patchnotes. ""Shake up the meta,"" they proclaimed, as if a hurricane in a china shop constitutes strategy. Massive damage nerfs to weapons and unique traits of armor.
Sunsetting... that was the moment when the roof caved in and walls began to bulge. They took our weapons – not just items, you see, but time made tangible. Hours of our lives, god rolls we treasured like family heirlooms... all discarded with a corporate smile about ""player experience.""
And then – slow rot. Content became faceless. Witch Queen briefly lit the old light in the windows, Final Shape reminded us what this building could have been... but the foundation was eaten through. No weapon felt meaningful. No activity – irreplaceable. Class building? A lick of a fresh paint on a bumpy hardwood floor and a new layer of a plaster on a bulged walls, that was carried out for too long, and amounted in too little result.
In 2018-2020 they gave us a cathedral. Magnificent. Singular. Then they buried that potential under layers of corporate incompetence and the paranoid fear of giving players too much.

The game is also full of quest bloat, which quickly becomes very tedious. The game would improve drastically if it wasn't full to the brim with ""I need you to deliver a pointless message to the person I'm standing right next to"" tasks.

The biggest grind of all is the walled content. The game lacks so many fundamentals that make an MMO great, such as sub-stat grinding and general farming. We all play them for the grind, the grind is a necessary characteristic of an MMO, but everything from farming to raiding is limited to a laughable daily/weekly limit which can only be alleviated by climbing over the paywall in one form or another. Even the bare basics, such as mining, logging, fishing, etc. is placed behind a cap... in an MMO. That's like playing Among Us, and the game says ""I'm sorry, you've completed too many tasks. Head to the store if you wish to continue."" There is no grind, only hinderance.

This WOULD be the greatest turn-based rpg I have EVER played.

WOULD. The truth though, is that this game stutters so badly and so frequently it is practically unplayable in Acts 2 and 3. Your game is going to be a little bit choppy in Act 1, worse in populated areas; you'll forgive it, because you're enjoying the story and game so much. Then Act 2 will come, and it will get worse. Cutscenes are now a choppy mess, character dialogue is constantly glitching out, so you're constantly pulled out of immersion. But you're invested at this point, so you sludge through the glitchiness to Act 3.

Then when your refund-window is LONG expired, and you're coming out of Act 2 finally on your way to Baldurs gate, and the truly performance-intensive areas are finally here... oh boy, it is bad. Non-stop stuttering, there is not one spoken word that isn't choppy, and the game truly becomes unplayable. I cannot believe a GOTY game performs like this.

The perforance is.. sad, the game struggles even on an RTX 3060 around medium settings at 1080p.

The file size is so overly bloated, it's rediclous.

Sometimes the world will take forever to properly load in(as in you can sometimes walk right out of the game world, or into an otherwise unnavagatable spot(like inside a boulder)).

Has terrible camera controls for vertical spaces.

Almost all the team mates are entirely unlikeable(I realise this is probably just a me thing).

Compared to other D&D games the character building is, just sad, it's been gutted so badly.

Level cap of 12, tells me it's unfinished.

A lot of spells and abilities even in those 12 levels worth are just missing.

One adult scene in particular(that you do have to go well out of your way for, and get plenty of warning, along with multiple chances to back out) isn't even legal in the US(thankfully I don't live there, but still worth mentioning)

Has a good number of missable quests,(as an example:  oh, you needed a rest, well too bad, this quest in a zone you haven't even gotten to yet failed, the child is dead, with nothing you can do about it other then start the whole game over) 

Mod implimentation is... bad... they should have just done the normal thing instead of, well, what they went with, Nexus may not be the most friendly of places, but it works properly far more often.

As I started with, it's probably not a bad game, but it's not a worthy sequal to Baulder's Gate II, the shift to turn based was a great idea, but the rest of it feels half baked in comparison.  I may get around to actually playing through what they bothered to make here someday, but for now, the file space is more valuable elsewhere used for programs that run at a decent rate.

You have missed the hype and most likely have already seen all of the spoilers. Either way, this game is better to watch anyway since the devs haven't updated the game since 2023 and that update was for the addition of MacOS players being able to play the game. I have a small feeling that the devs have abandoned this game which is sad since there are certain achievements that are now impossible to get due to certain areas having bugs where you simply either get soft-locked trying to enter them or can't enter them without somehow debugging if that is even possible (I'll get into those bugs later in this review). 

My personal opinion of this game is that it is amazing, it still seems to have an active community, it is cute as all hell and even funny at some parts, and the puzzles and story and interactions with the individual robots is just awesome. I love cats too :3

Anyway now, about the bugs: There is this weird bug in the game that affects three achievements. Those achievements being (from what I believe): Territory, Badges, and I Remember. The bug is where you just get stuck on certain parts of big pipes that you either walk on or through. I've had it to where it completely traps the character you play as forcing me to reload my save and I've had it to where it just blocks the character you play from progressing entirely.

If this game stopped being a roguelite, this would be so much better game. If either:
1) It added a checkpoint system every few levels so you don't have to start from the beginning again.
or, 2) It got rid of all upgrades and unlocked all abilites and weapons from the very start and ending this game was purely based on skill.

Either one of those and I would be actually playing the game to the end because it's such a cool game to play with especially on a handheld. In the current state I can only recommend it if you get someone's save file or a mod that does either of the above two things, otherwise I don't recommend any roguelite and that includes this game.

Roguelites have blown up in popularity but people have forgot how little dopamine hits every now and then can be really addicting and can really suck you in and just feels like you're progressing or having fun while inside your head, you're just agitated, nervous and fucking terrifed of dying in a video game.",False,1,1,1764040203
Hades,1145360,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561197997838861,"Let's preface this simply by saying, I enjoyed my first 50 hours with this game. Interesting character dynamics, fun varied combat, challenging but satisfying combat, all around I enjoyed nearly all of that 50 hours; But you wanna know why I have an extra 30 hours? 

Achievement hunting, specifically ONE Achievement. Now, I'll be the bigger man and won't spoil what it was, but I'll explain a bit about this game's rouge-like element. Each of the games zones are made out of rooms. Combat, challenges, survive etc. There's a particular type of room called Encounter Rooms. They often give great benefits. Issue is, they're also bloody rare. You can go 10-20 runs without seeing one. To get 3 achievements, you need to find each of the 3 zones encounter rooms and that's not all. Some of these achievements can only be done AFTER finishing the prior one so if you low-ball cant get a certain encounter in a previous zone, you're SOOL for a while. 

Worse part is, you can customize the difficulty of your runs, you can make Zagreus stronger or weaker as you see fit, but all that pales to the sheer fact you cant control Encounter Rooms. It's literal RNG baked into the game. So you really can't cheese this outside letting the mobs kill you after wasting 15 minutes into a run.

Overall, Great game but the encounter rooms made it overstay its welcome. Won't immediately try out Hades 2 now its fully released But I hope they did fix this of all things.

If you have experience in roguelikes, you will probably NOT enjoy it. Don't buy it just because of the hype (it's a mystery).

Hades really puts the LITE in roguelite.

The art is great. It's the best part for me.

The story is... I don't know, I didn't finish it. Lore is given in tiny bits of dialogue after each run. While it's nice to have a lot of voiced lines, it's just too much filler. From what I've seen, there's not much intrigue either.

Gameplay gets boring after several hours. There are fixed room layouts with the same enemies, very little gameplay variation. The most you can do is try different builds, but they all function mostly the same (basic button mashing).
After completing one almost-full run, I just couldn't force myself to do it again. And from what I've heard, you have to do 10+ complete runs just to get the full story.

Honestly, I'm sick of everyone talking about roguelikes. It's my favourite game genre and Hades is kinda giving it a bad name.

It is a roguelite, so by nature it is grindy. Although in theory you can beat it at the first try, most players will play dozens of runs before beating the final boss and they will repeat even more for true endings, and unlockables.

However, Hades differences between runs feel  fairly minor. Updates are boring,  most of them are small improvements in health or damage,  poison vs critical damage, etc. Enemies feel to have too much life and need  plenty of button mashing. And unlock new things takes too many runs.

But! you may be thinking, didn't they patch it? Surely it's all fixed now right, why the hate?

To which I direct you to take-two's EULA for not just this game, but everything they have a hand in. Even in absentia of the horrific anti-consumer practices that gearbox themselves are guilty of going back as far as them embezzling funding from SEGA to use on their own projects, if you look at the EULA that Take-Two is now making mandatory on virtually all of their games you will find that they have declared for themselves the rights to access and collect the following information:

-Your name
-Your Email
-Your phone number
-Your photo
-Your mailing address/zip code
-payment or purchase info

Furthermore, they also ""share"" (read:sell), your information with the following:

I realize that I'm going to most assuredly get flamed for daring to mention these things, likely by a bunch of addict lobotomites who are perfectly willing to sell their privacy, and any dignity or self-respect under the auspices that no one will actually come to collect on them personally, but as someone who purchased this game and played it for ages long before the IP was unceremoniously sold off and gutted by a company I despise due to their long history of abusing their customers, I cannot overstate how much I despise this entire series of events.

And yes, the truth is we're all trapped in this awful market environment, run roughshod over by corporate interests and information brokering thieves, but to have it so blatantly done to a game I loved, and considered one of the best in the genre? To see it literally become unplayable in a proper state for a year before they actually fixed things, and have everything unique and fun about it be dragged out and abused for all it's worth by unscrupulous corporate asshairs who couldn't give a shit less about something that was until that point, crowd funded and beloved by its community? It's like purchasing a car and then a decade later the company changes hands and they break into your house and reengineer every part of your vehicle to function worse so they can sell you back the parts they just stole from you. We aren't renters, we are owners of these things, at least we damn well should be for the amount of money we pay for these products. Enough is enough.

Dead Cells,588650,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199248183464,"Dead Cells — Fast-Paced Roguelike Action at Its Finest

Dead Cells is a masterclass in tight, fluid combat and procedural design. From the very first run, the game hooks you with its fast-paced movement, responsive controls, and endless surprises around every corner. Every level feels alive, challenging, and meticulously crafted, keeping you on your toes while rewarding skill and experimentation.

Combat is both satisfying and strategic. Whether you’re slashing with swords, raining arrows from a distance, or experimenting with magical abilities, every encounter demands quick thinking and adaptability. The variety of weapons, abilities, and power-ups ensures no two runs feel the same, making every death feel like a learning experience rather than a setback.

The procedural levels are beautifully designed, blending consistency with unpredictability. You’ll explore sprawling castles, perilous biomes, and hidden areas, all teeming with enemies, secrets, and loot. Each run is a fresh challenge, keeping the game endlessly replayable.

Progression is rewarding and fair. Unlocking new weapons, mutations, and abilities encourages experimentation and creates a sense of growth across multiple runs. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and satisfaction, making every victory feel earned.

Visually, Dead Cells is stunning. Pixel art meets fluid animation in a style that’s both retro and modern. Coupled with an energetic soundtrack, the game’s atmosphere feels tense, vibrant, and utterly alive.

Final Verdict:
Dead Cells is a thrilling roguelike that combines fluid combat, clever design, and endless replayability. Challenging, rewarding, and endlessly fun, it’s a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed platformers and roguelikes.

“Fast, fluid, and endlessly rewarding — Dead Cells proves that roguelikes can be both challenging and exhilarating.”

It is a Rogue game. If you are someone that likes making progress in your games, values a story or actually progressing while playing, look the other way. This genre is terrible if any of the above things matter to you at all.

If however, you enjoy playing the same section of a game over and over again with no save points, no checkpoints, and the smallest mistake forces you to lose everything and do it all over again, this is a game for you!

Dead Cells,588650,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199278354979,"The most overrated roguelite of all time and it's not even close. I'm not sure what it is, I don't understand why, but I feel like this game gets tons of praise that I just don't get. I won't deny visually the game is definitely pretty to look at, but it doesn't really stand out much to me. Not much in this game stands out to me. Tons of cosmetics, tons of weapons, tons of utilities, tons of unlocks, tons of additional things you can get too like bombs or traps; it almost feels, dare I say, bloated. To me personally. But I wonder, why do I love having a ton of unlocks in games like Tboi or Ror2, but with this game I don't care for some reason? I think there may just be something in the core of this game that I don't like.

Some things I just straight up don't like: Level progression. This game's progression across levels feels so, so painfully muddled, and nonlinear. This could be something that very well might be fixed after playing the game for long enough, but dude, it's been 29, almost 30 hours of playtime as of right now. Why do I still not understand how I'm getting to like 70% of the levels I'm in. You start at level 1, then there's the two different level 2's, and then around each of those there's like 5 more levels that, I'm gonna be real, I can't even tell if they're actual main levels or just alternate areas. What the fuck is happening. I've probably been to like 10 different areas in the game so far. If you put a million dollars on the line, and put me in 7 of those areas and asked me ""Where are you in the game right now?"", I still could not give you a straight answer. It's just very needlessly over complicated.

I never cared too much for the combat either. I try to block enemies, but parry timing doesn't feel right that often. This could very well be a me thing but combat just feels very clunky, ESPECIALLY in the later levels when there's more enemies that have more complex and unpredictable attacks that are additionally sometimes stacked on top of each other. It's not the type of thing where enemies take turns either, shit will just attack you and that makes parrying so much harder. On top of this at the end of each level you have one mutation to pick, from a list of like 50+. It's just numbers. It's just a bunch of numbers, more damage when you do this, blocking does this, this ranged stuff is a little better, nothing stands out. It just all feels so lame and not unique or impactful enough at all. That's how a lot of stuff in this game feels for me, just a lot of Quantity > Quality, honestly.

If it sounds like I'm hating just to hate, I definitely get that don't get me wrong, but believe me, I'm not. I am STILL, from time and time again, coming back to this game and playing it for a bit, just to see if something sticks. As of right now though nothing has really grabbed my attention too much from this game. Nothing specific from it has made me truly yearn to come back to it, like a really cool weapon or gimmick or something. I'm just trying to find SOMETHING here, okay? I'm really trying, I promise. I see this game get a lot of positive reception, I want to understand it. This game's probably a better metroidvania than a roguelite honestly, and if that's your jam then that's awesome, dude. I may just not be that big of a fan of metroidvanias. As a big roguelite guy I wouldn't personally recommend it but that's just from my own personal taste.

This is stupid but I have to add this: Guys. This is the year 2025, and we STILL don't have options for adjusting the graphics in our game? Are we actually serious? This game just started running terribly for me as I've been trying to play it again now, with the same computer and everything, and I can't change fps or graphics or anything. I forgot but, I guess it is hard to advance past the prestigious, high-end computer technology of the late 90's. That is fucking INSANE, just ridiculous.

Maybe a bit overhyped. 
_________________

Main issue: 
even with lot of stuff to unlock the runs don´t feel like you are making progress at all or you make a real impact. 

You have like 3 classes which make different items /skills better - but there is less difference.
I mean c´mon, who cares if your turret shoots flames, canonballs or arrows. 
Same to e.g. swords, daggers - they just have like 3 attack patterns while hitting the smash button. 
You can hook, you can kick - that´s almost the highlights here. 

Don´t get me wrong: You CAN parry with a shield. There is variety (ice bow, explosions,...). But you carry (mostly) 2 weapons, 2 skills. And you will exchange them, due to ""level"" of items. Use & exchange w/ new one.
I´d have liked a ""upgrade your character"" thing, to really create a lasting build. 

You have 3 ""passive options"" to choose per run. To really make a difference this restriction is pain. 
Compare binding of isaac - you got tons of passive items, which also stack. Not here.
So don´t expect really awesome combos...

Bosses will get repetitive. Yes they get stronger and have different move sets while you make progress - they still feel the same. 
Maybe this is also because of the plain story... There is also no real benefit they provide for the run while defeating them. 

There is lot to like: in my case especially the art style, humor and references to other games.
But I was expecting something different.

The intro were so effing long I had to go into the game folder and delete those darn three videos and you should do the same if you don't want to spent an hour long watching that shjt when you first start the game.

Slow pace, so much walking. There are literally 10 more badass soldier on the train and I have to do all the work for them, alone, make no sense. And my chick and her sugar daddy keep yelling at each other all the time.

NPCs talk a lot and continuously, and argue endlessly, one person hasn't finished speaking yet and the other has already jumped in and yelling. The English dub is really bad, cringe and tense with a weird accent, I had to switch to Russian dub to listen to it less annoying.

Annoying buzzing sound (on my watch I guess) really drive me crazy!! WTF what that? Idk if it is a bug/glitch or game's feature but I can not stand it any second. F that sheat!

One thing that seemed really cool at first but turned out to be really ridiculous was the sound effects, for example when an NPC was talking, I was standing right in front of them but when I turned the camera left/right/behind I couldn't hear them anymore, it was funny and ridiculous.

The requirements for a perfect clearing of the levels fail to trigger making a perfect game a crap shoot; you fail stealth sections without any alerted enemies

every weapon you get sucks and the level clear penalty for your material makes upgrading weapons a chore

the exploration is as shallow as can be and literally crap compared to shovelware like ""mad max"" (mad max is a bad game but at least it DOESNT PENALIZE YOU FOR THE SCRAP YOU COLLECT EVERY TIME YOU CLEAR A REGION FOR ""REPAIRS"")

The enemies are bullet sponges and playing on any difficulty higher than normal is just garbage. they shoot you from across the map in fog you cant see through then take several shots to the hear AFTER THEIR HELMET AND MASK FLY OFF

I dont remember this game sucking that bad at launch and didnt review it but holy crap i cant recommend this game at all. just read the books, its sad that all of the metro games suck but they changes this to play more like stalker. like i seriously just want to wander in the wastes and collect trinkets and shoot the occasional skag/hostile scavenger, this is all just artificially difficult to pad out playtime. i remember how short this crap is and on my current playthrough i havent even stolen the strain yet and ive died 30+ times. 

Do not buy this game and if you do play it on normal bc its just trying to pass the 2 hour refund deadline; NOTHING you do in the rest of the game minus that stupid gas filled tunnel on the third map are as hard as this horrible intro. like they have seriously made the intro as bad as atomic hearts for some reason.

Lethal Company throws players into a darkly comedic sci-fi world where you and your crew of unfortunate contractors are sent to abandoned industrial moons to salvage scrap for a ruthless megacorporation. What starts as a simple job quickly spirals into a tense, unpredictable experience as every mission risks becoming your last.

The game shines in its cooperative gameplay and emergent chaos. Working together to explore derelict facilities, avoid traps, and carry loot back to the ship creates constant tension—especially when creatures begin stalking the halls. Communication, quick thinking, and teamwork determine whether you escape alive or become yet another “unfortunate loss” on the company ledger.

The progression loop is simple but addictive. Collect scrap, sell it, buy better gear, and take on more dangerous environments. Each moon offers unique layouts, hazards, and threats, making every run feel fresh. The randomness of enemy encounters and environmental quirks adds to the thrill and unpredictability.

Atmosphere is one of the game’s biggest strengths. The dim lighting, eerie soundscapes, and unsettling creature designs create an environment that’s equal parts scary and hilarious—especially when panic sets in and everything falls apart. The blend of horror and humor gives the game a unique charm that keeps players coming back.

Final Verdict:
Lethal Company delivers a perfect mix of tension, teamwork, and unpredictable fun. Whether you're playing seriously or embracing the chaos, it’s an endlessly entertaining co-op experience filled with memorable moments and dark humor.

“Terrifying, chaotic, and ridiculously fun—clock in, survive, and hope the Company approves.”

HELLDIVERS 2,553850,31.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198108256612,"As a massive fan of the original game, I do not like the sequel. It feels like less of a co-op game and more of a ""everyone split up and do their own thing"" kind of game because the game is designed in ways that punish you for wanting to stay together with your teammates so it just feels heavily discouraged. Enemy spawns struggle to split between 4 players in different parts of the map so it results in the hardest difficulty feeling hilariously easy at times when one or more people barely get any spawns and just freely do objectives, but if you stay together you all get all the enemies spawns pretty much all the time which just ends up wasting so much time.

Helldivers 1 was built, designed, and balanced a lot around co-op centric things, your team had far more reason to have different roles and loadouts instead of making a strong versatile build that can do everything independently, team reload mechanic was a much stronger and encouraged mechanic, and the team was not allowed to be separated.

A lot of strategems and weapons also just feel worse than the HD1 counterparts in terms of damage, ammo economy, and general effectiveness. The standard Breaker shotgun and the Kinetic Shield are some of the worst offenders to me.

HD2 also lacks some crucial teamwork focused strategems that people like me desperately want back, such as the Rep-80 heal beam gun, or the Angel Guard dog medical backpack. The stim pistol was not a fun addition to the game as trying to hit people with that is insufferable, I don't care if people say it's skill issue, it is not fun, and not like it's very effective anyway cause players tend to die faster than it can heal anyway.

Player survivability in HD2 also just does not feel as fair or as fun as HD1 too. The incap system was completely removed so you just outright die (Gives another less incentive to use SMG's compared to HD1, hell you can't even carry artillery shells with one hand and shoot a one handed weapon at the same time anymore either), and weak enemies can even kill you in just a mere few hits sometimes. The games survivability relying so much on stims is not particularly a design choice I like either. I wish they kept the incap system and players being a bit tankier, and you had very very slow health regen instead if you arn't taking damage. (Stims should of been something in the grenade slot instead to replace grenades in my opinion.)

I don't like how armor went from a cosmetic only thing in HD1 so you could wear what you want and select the perk you wanted separately, to now armor passives have to be handcuffed to armors that I don't want to wear while the ones I want to wear have awful passives or ones I really don't want to use cause it won't complement my build. Which is rather annoying.

Performance and game stability is also not particularly great either. This game used to run well on my system early on but after a bunch of updates it feels like it really struggles to be stable, I know they started trying to address this though it's still not anywhere near how well the game used to run yet. (I acknowledge more major engine tech stuff may take time, but felt I'd mention this.)

I donno, maybe it's a hot take, but I do not like this game because it took away the biggest thing I praised the original for and that's feeling like a true co-op designed experience first and foremost, where lone wolf gameplay was actively discouraged. I don't like some of the other design decisions/changes too. I'd only recommend this game if you are okay with it being nothing like the original game, the game itself isn't terrible, but as an original fan it feels too alienating for me, like it was catoring to a completely different audience for the sake of being mainstream. 

There's a lot more I'm probably forgetting off the top of my head right now, so I'll end it with this. TLDR: I wish this game just tried to be more like HD1 in almost all aspects but with the third person perspective change and with more content/features, not drastically change or redesign things that worked just fine before.",False,2,0,1764159083

Playing with my friends was a blast as we tried many different combinations and weapons to tackle bugs, bots, and otherwise. While the game was fun in the beginning, the game now feels like a slog or chore. The personal secondary objectives to get medals used to be ""Use X gun for Y kills"" or ""Use an airstrike or sentry gun for Y kills."" Now it's always ""Collect samples"" or ""Evac 3 times from a faction-specific map."" The major orders follow suit with them just being ""Hold planet Z because why not?""

The samples I've collected have been in my inventory for over a year now; having upgraded my personal ship to the maximum, I don't think there will be any personal ship upgrades in the future or at all. 

The enemies are slanted towards the bugs last time I played, with them having numerous updates/upgrades from invisibility to flying acid dragons and fog-spewing chargers, while the bots do have different types of the flamethrower variety. It would be pretty cool if they had ships dispersing fog or invisible patrols or had fighting styles like the Illuminate.

The scope of the game has stretched it so thin, and despite some amazing work from the art team, including the sweet OST by Donglekumquat, it wastes so much of its effort on creating games that are destined to go unplayed, or forever be half-baked.

For a social game, Tower Unite is really bad at incentivising being social, and that is no more apparent than in the highly popular casino, where about half the lobby will be pressing their space bar for hours on end at the slots, while the adjacent poker hall, a game perfect for social interactions with strangers, sits empty. The Arcade is full of minigames, yet only a handful of the 20+ are even multiplayer, and the ones that really payout are once again just mindnumbingly pressing the space bar for hours on end. 
The game's poor balancing of rewards can encourage players to be antisocial.

Tower Unite is capable of putting out genuinely great games, I would still hold its Minigolf as one of the best out there, and you can easily lose yourself in its condo system for hours with how much possibility it has, but so much of its development has gone towards things that are pointless, games that are buggy, unbalanced, or simply lack the demand. 

A social game doesn't demand a weak quake imitator requiring years of development when most of its other features are still incomplete. 
Something as simple as checkers can bring strangers to socialise, and Tower Unite really needed more things like that, simple ways for strangers to be brought together, and I think in its tunnel vision to check off Kickstarter promises they forgot that that was the most important part of the game's concept.",False,1,0,1764114083

The moderation team consists of the owner who defends a prominent pedophile. The community will do anything to get you banned if any of your views do not agree with theirs, especially gay crap. Even if you avoid the bad side of Tu's community they'll stalk you and do anything they can to remove you from their game if they find out anything about you doesn't agree with them.

The most depressing reason I do not recommend this game is because of the degeneracy allowed to seep through the cracks of private condos/player homes that the game gives you. Yes you are free to build whatever you want however you want with the awesome features of workshop and canvases. Unfortunately these canvases are not moderated in any way. Players are allowed to post all kinds of porn in their condos and some condos have cp. There are r-18 tags but the players are so degen that they wont turn their tags on and don't get punished for not following the rules and I still come across porn with the tags hidden in the settings. If you post anything right wing or Christian-like you will get banned.
I submitted a ticket to fix a feature where you can join off your friend's list without seeing tags or condo ownership and that got overshadowed by a Halloween update which sucks because if you join through a friend and they are in a fetish condo and you do not know that they are in there, you won't see beforehand what you are joining into which I have unfortunately seen by joining a friend I just added on the game.

Don't support this game's echo chamber and hive mind/mob mentality. 
Initially starting out on this game I was impressed by the creative capabilities with condos and the amount of activities you could do with friends, so much so that I purchased one of the supporter packs. I'm a pretty reserved person so I don't speak up too often but after playing for a while in the plaza with my friends I began to notice the same kinds of people coming on making inflammatory statements, sexual comments, and just downright degeneracy. Then you look at their Steam profiles and see that many of those who frequent this game are SEVERELY detached from society, mentally unwell, and/or promote unhealthy things (like ""consensual"" sexual content with those who are underage). They seem to go by a ""we don't take care of things unless they're reported"" mentality unless you're speaking out against their hypocrisy, THAT is when you get some kind of ban as I have seen and heard of from many players, friend and not. They claim to defend against things like bigotry and certain figures so they can use those things as a blanket statement to silence what they don't agree with. I had a friend having a proper cordial discussion with a trans individual about how we should help take care of the trans community's mental health when they're young instead of just thrusting them onto HRT when someone came up and started harassing my friend, yelling over them, making load noises with items, and acting like my friend was being transphobic (they certainly are not and stated such several times). Evidently, after those 2 individuals went off to ""chat"" my friend was banned the very next day for HARASSING after never receiving so much as a warning prior to this. I can go into even more detail on other instances of inappropriate moderation but this review is already long enough and I'm honestly done with this game.",False,34,3,1760948030

There's multiple reports of CSAM/CP in condos (in reviews on Steam here, and claims/reports of users encountering it) and it has also been reported to Valve to delist the game. 
For asking what will be done regarding this problem since there's multiple reports (on Steam reviews & others spoken with); me & others get permanetely voice/text banned in game and within the social media such as discord.

This is not how you moderate your own product. If you do not have enough staff to moderate it, that is the companies fault for not being prepared and or properly staffed. It is a similar situation as to what's happening with Roblox for harboring predators as they have been taken to court for similar/same reasons.
There are minors that play this game at times, if you can't have the proper moderation for your product when there's reports of CP, it needs to shut down & or you need to have many more moderators, especially in game. It may be said they take this seriously, but yet it's a problem that keeps happening when it shouldn't as people still report this as a serious problem.
There should not be a single claim and or report of any predators on the platform. That is the fault of the company. In this case PixelTail, who should know better. I did not know how much of a problem this game had until only recently, when I first started playing this game a few years ago I did not know about these serious problems. The developers are their own moderators from what I read, which is not enough. They need an active moderation team in game and on the socials.
It is very strange that the community itself treats this as a joke, marking this review as funny. That's not normal and it only makes PixelTail look worse. That raises suspicions. only ones who would joke about a serious issue like this, may be predators themselves. Other games like vrchat are part of this problem too (which they've been notified with evidence multiple times by users). Some people need to have common sense as well, just because you have not seen something doesn't mean it doesn't happen. There's multiple reports of these problems by users for a reason.

I love this game and I love the interactions and conversations I've had through it. Do I recommend this game? No. Do I regret buying it, and the supporter packs? No. I have not and do not support Pixeltail through their Patreon. [strike]I will probably continue playing it since I have friends I introduced to it and I do enjoy condo building.[/strike] After having thought about it for a while, I won't be. There's no fixing this.[/b]

[h1]Gaming Time[/h1]

I think this game is horribly mismanaged. I'm not a game dev, I don't have any experience managing a company or studio. I also don't believe that any dev should take their community suggestions one to one and implement them full stop, it's their game and I respect that, but this game doesn't respect your time. I play all sorts of games, and I enjoy a good grind. In a game like Tower Unite, isn't the focus suppose to be on hanging out with people and making memories?

If you don't know, as it is with the current Halloween event you get a coin every 5 minutes, if you're actively playing a game that's not in the Casino or Condo- you must be the Plaza playing an plaza minigame, the Arcade, one of the game worlds (these are rewarded upon completion, so example, 5 days of Zombie Massacre + Boss) or you can earn them through Fishing, which isn't on a timer but is a percentage chance to drop. The best way to grind these are by Fishing and playing one game every 5 minutes. You can get coins from other activities, such as the Remains or Trick or Treat buckets, but those are also a percentage chance and on their own event timers.

If you want one Potted Carnivorous Plant, it costs 25 Ghoul Coins, which is 125 minutes, or 2 hours, spent so long as you're actively getting coins every 5 minutes exactly. This doesn't take into consideration that as of writing the backend for rewarding coins and other drops is bugged and the timer can be skewed. That is one copy of this condo item, and you cannot duplicate it without having multiple. Going off someone else's math, which has been consistent for the past 6 years I have played this game, if you want to buy one of everything, you'll need 328 coins or a minimum of 27 hours of just coin grinding. But we'll be fair and say you don't want or need everything, not everyone does.

Thing is, this is not just a holiday event issue. Usually you think of holidays as fun and rewarding, a distraction for people to get together and celebrate, but this is how the game is normally. Zombie Massacre, considering that you're playing solo and the meta, will take 15-20 minutes to earn roughly 30k units based on performance. If I go to the Casino and I play the horse betting game called Silver Saddles, I can bet 100k and make a minimum profit of that same 30k in what, 3-5 minutes tops? That's on the low end, a minimum total of 130k every game. This is considered an exploit. If you're an active condo builder who likes building with detail, 1 mil units is a drop in the bucket. Everything in Tower Unite has and will be funneled to the condo, unless you treat it like a party game to occasionally play with friends, which is perfectly fine too. Problem is, it is treated and advertised as the latter when the game is built with the former in mind, and not equally.

[h1]Social Hour[/h1]

A lot of people have and will continue to (rightfully) complain about the community. Yes, you have a wide breadth of people from all kinds of creeds and origins that will join a social game. Why anyone is suprised by that is beyond me, an individuals actions is what should be judged, not the individual or a generalized group. My problem comes with the fact that moderation in Tower Unite is negligble at best, straight up absent at it's worse. I'm also of the belief that a more laxed approach should be taken, and more users should use the Ignore/Mute and Block options that exists in games. Does that mean I am okay with the slurs, bigotry, harassment, and many other vile hatred statements that are spewed in this game? No. I just think for the most part that a lot of arguments can be handled like adults and most, including myself, are quick to anger and hatred.

Recently, there has been someone with an extensive track record of getting muted and banned for all sorts of reasons spamming a Discord link in the Global chat which can be seen by everyone in plazas, minigames, and condos as well as the main menu. Normally that's just a rule break, no advertising and solicitation? My problem with it is that it was a Discord link being advertised with another url that leads to a website advertising said Discord which has a focus on NSFW/Porn/Adult themes and sharing. Am I some sort of pearl clutching prude who hates the idea of adults enjoying themselves? No. Take one look at my profile. My problem is that it was being advertised in the Global chat and that person only got a 24 hour text chat ban, in a game that is not explicitly for adults, that allows children, teenagers, and vulnernable adults amongst each other. Some might mention the existence of Mature condos that feature similar imagery and chatting, but you need to explicitly turn on a setting to view those and it is not enabled by default. Global chat is on by default. Take Roblox as a better example of this kind of behavior and where it's getting them.

I'm not asking for the devs who are also the moderation team to be awake 24/7 and constantly monitoring the chat, nor am I asking for them to setup some kind of age verification or AI chat tool that'll constantly scan the chat. My solution? Get a moderation team. Problem with it? It's been asked and people have actively stepped up to say they will be a moderator. This and along with repeated harassment reports is completely normal behavior for most. This game doesn't have thousands of players, you see the same faces. The punishment does not fit the crime.

That is one incident that I didn't even fully cover, there are plenty of others, its an iceberg. And before I get asked ""did you report"", yes, I have reported people. Problem is, despite reporting, should I rely on a report, which might not be seen for several hours, for someone advertising adult servers, someone else doxxing, another hosting CSAM content? Why isn't there an active moderation team for a game thats active at all hours and allow you to run free?

[h1]More Questions[/h1]

I'm not someone who underestimates the time and patience it takes to not only develop a game, especially with the scope and scale that this game has. I have defended Pixeltail in the past, just like I have defended other games and studios, when I think they deserve it. I don't expect updates to come weekly, I don't expect anyone on to cater to me or anyone else. I also can't say I don't hesitate to make suggestions I know will be ignored. I'm not going to villainize Pixeltail.

It still does put into question why 1.0 released as rushed as it did. Why the Cats and Dogs update had a pack of dogs from an asset store, that wasn't even the full package, but one you can get through a pirated direct download. Why do you still need to spend so many hours to buy one silly little background for your profile that will only ever been seen by someone opening the scoreboard. Why there is so much going against you trying to have fun, from the backend that keeps track of of your inventory being bugged, to the chugging of servers past at 32/64 players, why an ingame Casino is more worth your time grinding than playing a game with your friends. Why are so many people allowed to get away with a slap on the wrist for such disgusting words and actions?

I was not a GMT (Garrys Mod Tower/GM Tower) player. I'm only speaking on recent feelings as of this year and the past few I've played.

Spent a lot time building in this game, that was pretty fun, built a town and set up all kinds of contraptions, personally wasn't interested in much else the game had to offer as I could always find a better alternative on the steam marketplace. the concept is cool, and the devs are just doing their thing so I wouldn't really throw them under the bus or anything.  I can see why people really enjoy this game but after spending a couple hundred hours, I have found myself exhausted with what the game has to offer and perhaps a bit disenchanted.  I personally wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, there are better alternatives out there.  (trying my best not to flame and be straightforward with this)  EDIT: also, like many many people have stated there is a serious issue of user shared content in this game,I won't single anyone out or throw any groups of people under the bus but you should know anyone can post whatever they want and so as long as you simply state ""18+"" you are able to get away with sharing some pretty wicked stuff. so that feature comes with all the pros and cons of being able to share content in a public space, it's moderated yeah, but many things slip between the cracks like all public forums. The team will say they do their best to moderate but you will usually still find something totally shocking and it's usually on you for agreeing to enter an 18+ condo in the first place, which is just kind of a funny rule that is constantly bent.

By shifting to a first-person perspective, the game plunges players directly into the claustrophobic and unsettling world of the Baker family, delivering an intensity and immersion rarely seen in horror games.

The atmosphere is pitch-perfect: every creaking floorboard, shadowy hallway, and grotesque detail contributes to a constant sense of dread. The game’s visuals and sound design are exceptional, combining to make even familiar settings feel deeply menacing.

Gameplay emphasizes survival and careful strategy. Ammo and resources are scarce, forcing players to think before they act and heightening the tension of every encounter. Puzzles and exploration are intelligently designed, rewarding curiosity while maintaining a constant sense of vulnerability.

The story is gripping and horrifying, blending psychological terror with body horror in a way that feels fresh yet unmistakably Resident Evil. The Baker family, particularly Jack Baker, are unforgettable antagonists whose presence keeps players on edge throughout.

Overall, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard revitalizes the franchise with a terrifying, immersive experience that balances horror, story, and gameplay flawlessly. It’s a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers seeking a true survival horror thrill.

I didn’t walk into that house to be a hero.
I just wanted her back.
That was my first mistake.

Nothing prepares you for the Bakers. No horror movie, no nightmare, no childhood fear. They don’t just attack you — they claim you. Jack speaks to you like you’re already family. Marguerite feeds you like she wants you to rot properly. Lucas watches you break and laughs because he knows he’s already won.

Every time I healed, the pain returned differently.
Every time I lost part of myself, something else grew in its place.
The house learned me.
Room by room. Breath by breath.

And the worst part? A part of me understood it. The mold doesn’t lie. It shows you exactly what you’re made of — usually blood, panic, and very bad decisions.

The DLCs feel like the memories I tried hardest to bury. Fragments, regrets, things I didn’t want to relive but kept resurfacing like the swamp water in my lungs. Some offered closure. Some reopened wounds that never had time to close.

I survived.
But survival feels like a technicality.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561199262235522,"Growing up in the early 2000's, Resident Evil was a series I was familiar with but never played. I didn't care for the horror genre, and the games seemed really creepy to me. Recently I decided to try something new and buy this game along with Resident Evil VIII in a combo package for $20. This game had good reviews, and I didn't want to spoil anything so I went in blind. Minor spoilers ahead.

The build up to this game was good, and the first 20mins set the scene well. You're looking for your fiance that disappeared 3yrs ago because she recently contacted you with her location. You drive to a desolate swamp in Louisiana and find an abandoned house and shack. At this point the game started getting really creepy, and I enjoyed how it was building up. It reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You find your fiance locked up in the basement. Turns out she's been possessed by something. She attacks you with a knife and you defend yourself with your bare hands. She stabs right through your hand and I was like ""oh shit..."". About 10secs later your pour hydrogen peroxide on the wound and it magically heals up. Really? This immediately killed the immersion for me. 2mins later, your SAME hand gets stabbed again. Then it gets cut off by a chainsaw. At that point I was like ""Oh SHIT!"". You get a pistol and somehow reload the gun while holding the gun with your only hand. It made very little sense. I'm not kidding, about 2mins later, your hand gets stapled back on like nothing happened. This was like a slap in the face. I always thought these games were more realistic. Sure they have monsters and zombies, but I didn't know the main character was a fucking super human. To make things worse, I got stuck right after the dinner scene and didn't know where to go. I was already bored so I let the psycho kill me. He hit me about 10-15 times, and I'm playing on normal difficulty. I plan on finishing this game, but my expectations are pretty low at this point. Hopefully as I continue this play through my thoughts will change.",False,3,7,1762108900

I've tried so much to like it, but I get bored and cannot come to terms with the limited gameplay, even though there's so much customization with different weapons, skills and attribute combinations.

The game world lacks soul, even though everybody says that there's a very engaging main story with plot twists, which I cannot find the courage to follow because of the boring gameplay.

I used to love old JRPGS on SNES and PSX, but there was the perceived freedom that you were in an open world. This game just throws you in a PS2-like linear minimap that you have to navigate and inevitably come across a minimap boss that looks like it's come from the Dark Souls series.

Where it falls short is the actual gameplay and mechanics. It's uninspired and boring. When you learn to dodge and parry, then every battle or confrontation becomes painfully mundane. I found myself only doing the battles I needed to just to move the story along so I could watch the movie. This could be a great movie when it comes out.

I am high-functionally autistic, so I prefer turn-based games over real-time action because my reactions are kinda … slow.
I can manage to survive many real-time action games in „story“/„easy“ mode, so we are not talking about pathological impairments here.
I WILL keep the game, and I so much WANT to love it for its deep story and beautiful art design, but there is one complaint I need to state here as an official bug report or feature request - WHEN I SET EASIEST STORY MODE, I WANT A FAIR EASY STORY MODE!!!
LOWER THE DODGE/PARRYING TIMINGS ASAP! 
IF PLAYERS WANT CHALLENGING TIMINGS, THEY DON‘T CHOOSE STORY MODE!

I am very much willing to totally twist around my review to thumbs up and praise if you are so kind to reach out to me and/or somehow reconsider your choice in quicktime timings and hardness to be more inclusive for those who are not just „too lazy to get good“, but at a weaker point at all. Why must games be so hard in general without including additional customers (more than you might think?) to also be served with a great game?
I am willing to practice and learn, but within my personal comfort zone and capabilities.
If there is a story mode, make it a fair story mode, not a 1% less super-hard-mode, in my very personal opinion, this is almost false advertising at its finest.
PLEASY, MAKE IT SUPER HARD FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE HARD MODE, 
You can design achievements only for those playing harder modes, I am with you, or give more or less XP in-game for harder play styles, but please don‘t exclude players that are just more casual or even have some limits. Your game is pretty, packed with story and emotion, why exclude such a wide range of players from enjoying it?

The reason for this seems to be some kind of moral system whereby if you moral drops to zero it's as good as dying, only you can heal health and avoid fights, but you cannot avoid skill checks, unless you just want to remain in your hotel room and go nowhere and do nothing.

Full Review:
This isn't a game for people who've been through certain types of trauma. Namely, trauma having to do with your self esteem and value. First of all, you do NOT get to customize a character. One is given to you and he's already a psychological mess. If you have deep wells of empathy this game will trigger you in a way that is more harmful than good. The overall message is for people who haven't yet developed the skills or life experience to understand the illusion of choice is not freedom. It's a game with a very dark, nihilistic message. While Nihilism can be enlightening and even freeing for some people, this game doesn't really allow you to explore those aspects of it. It tends to repeatedly highlight only the worse parts of humanity in a context absent of hope or empathy. Why the devs would include an entire segment of dialogue that analyzes and breaks down racism in support of it, is a confusing and concerning choice. There are better ways of exposing how toxic racism is without glorifying at the same time. The game is definitely thought provoking but it does it in a very abusive manner that could be harmful to people who struggle with CPTSD, AuDHD and healthy emotional regulation. 
This game shook me because I've already learned the darker lessons and hard truths life ultimately teaches you. I didn't need a rerun of trauma and I think the lessons could be learned without it, but I understand why some people feel it's necessary. It might be a great game, but it's not for everybody and that's why I can't recommend it.",False,2,3,1763665357

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198877995722,"I decided to write this review since I see a lot of people have a rough time with the entry barrier into Master Duel. 

Master Duel is described by Konami as the place where you will duel at the highest level and when they say highest level they are not downplaying it. First things you need to be aware of is that yes there is a barrier when you start playing that at first might seem overwhelming, but you need to remember you are jumping at the deep-end of the Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling experience. Some people criticize Master Duel for not being beginner friendly, and although I do agree there is a curve to adapt to in terms of dueling, specially for people who are returning to Yu-Gi-Oh after many years away or people who have only watched the anime or who are experiencing the brand for the first time, I also think the game gives you the tools so that you are able to build a strong deck very early into the game. 

Chances are yes you are going to get whooped during your first couple of duels, but that is to be expected since you are at the first steps of your deck building but if you put your time to learn the ins and outs of the game, it is a great way to enjoy the franchise. 

Some useful things things for people willing to give it a shot:
- Master Duel is very very F2P friendly, the game gives you so many easy ways to get gems (the currency used for opening packs) and occasionally even give you full structure-decks through things like friend code referral and such. If you manage your gems correctly you can easily make a viable competitive deck in just a few minutes and can probably average a new deck every month or so.

- Do your tutorials (skip them if you have a basic understanding of the game) and after, when picking one of the 3 beginners decks, just pick the one that matches your latest understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! 

- Before entering ranked matches, go to solo mode and there you will find many ""missions"" that reward you with cosmetics such as mates, duel fields, sleeves and even some actual card, but most importantly finishing the Duel Strategy missions reward you with a total of 2,400 gems. By doing solo mode not only can you unlock different rewards but you will also fulfill some of the challenges and missions that reward you with even more gems. 

- Now when it comes to currencies we have gems which are used to open card packs and just buy anything from the store and you also have crafting points (CP) ranging from Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare points. These CP are used to craft cards individually which is helpful if the card you are looking for is not available on any dedicated pack or if you only need to craft 1 copy of that card. In principle crafting a card take 30 CP regardless of the rarity (and when crafting there is a random chance of it being one of three different types of foiling which basically just means how shiny the card will be). Then some cards you don't want can be dismantled into CP of the corresponding rarity of the card going from 10 - 30 CP depending on the foiling of the card dismantled. One thing to note with CP is that not all cards can be dismantled as some free cards you get wont be able to be dismantled, but every card from pack openings can be dismantled into CP (cards from structure decks can't be dismantled tho). Best tip is to spend your SR CP and UR CP wisely and only when you really want or need a card since they are the hardest points to gather at first.

- Now before building a deck, opening packs and crafting cards you need to ask yourself the most important question when joining Master Duel for the first time - Which deck do you want to play with? - This is the most important decision you will have to make since the deck you chose will be your partner for the first month or so, so more than a meta deck just go for the one you will have the most fun with.

- Once you know which deck you want to go with, the best thing to do is to just create a deck and add all the cards you will want in it, that way you will know which cards you have, which cards you are missing and their respective rarities. Then you have to best options, one of them is to take one SR or UR card from that archetype and craft it, in doing so you will unlock a secret pack from that archetype which then you can spend your gems opening packs to get cards from that archetype. You can also go into the store and look at the structure decks and see if the archetype you want is available there, that way by spending 500 gems you will get access to the core of the archetype and can be a shortcut to building your desired deck.

- 2 PRO TIPS when it comes to gems are NEVER SPEND GEMS on the MASTER PACK since the amount of cards in it makes it impossible to get anything you actually want (you are better sticking to secret packs) and also ALWAYS BUY THE DUEL PASS since this battle pass not only returns your gem investment if completed but also rewards you with limited-time accessories and tons of CP from all the rarities.

- If you really want to add a meta element to your deck you can also go to the shop special section and under bundle deals you will see bundles with 10 Master Packs and also a meta staple card. 

- With all of this said if you dismantle any and every card you dont need and if you claim your rewards and open more packs you will end up with a good deck to enter ranked as any cards you dont get can probably be crafted with the CP earned from the dismantle of cards. 

When it comes to dueling the game helps you flagging posible actions that can be taken or cards that can be played in case you are not fully experienced with your deck. As you climb through ranked you will earn more gems that can be used to make your deck stronger and such. 

Again, as this is a competitive TCG it does take time to settle in but the more time you put and as long as you are playing cards that are fun to you I really think this game has a lot to offer for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. Ranked might be a tough pill to swallow at first but by making mistakes and losing duels is how you will learn.

While naturally it shares every issue with normal gameplay of the real card game, it also goes much deeper then that. First point: The gatcha system (while theres certainly FAR worse ones out there) is terrible. Grinding gems takes forever and once you've cleared solo mode, say goodbye to ever getting anything new ever again, because the game will VERY slowly drip feed you a paultry sum of gems IF YOU WIN a ranked match and thats about it (GOOD LUCK winning without a tier 0 deck)

Second point: Cheaters. The game is FULL of them. Everything you can imagine. FTK bots, AFK bots, players who can see your hand at all times, people who manipulate the cards drawn on both sides, deck stacking, its awful and nearly unplayable.

Third point: The TERRIBLE and WILDLY inconsistent banlist. So...you're telling me that the current tier 0 (which has been tier 0 for nearly 3 months now) doesn't have a single card even so much as semi-limited, but secret village, card of demise, POT OF PROSPERITY are banned? Maxx C is at 2. Pot of duality is at 1. What.

Fourth point: It is VERY begginer hostile. The game just expects you to casually pay over 100 REAL LIFE dollars to MAYBE get a CHANCE at getting specific cards that are essential and you litterally CAN NOT win even in rookie without. 

Fifth point: Bugs. And lots of them. I get this is the most complex card game of all time so naturally, when in digital form, its not gurenteed to work properly every time, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Were getting nonsense like a card that does NOT have to be face-up to resolve somehow fizzeling after being MST'd, cards whos activation requirement is something like ""Target 1 card you control"" and somehow not being allowed to activate it despite the fact there is NOTHING preventing targeting anywhere, special summoning from the grave with necrovalley on the field, ect ect. FIX YOUR GAME KONAMI

sixth point: The horrible meta: I get this is an issue in the TCG and OCG as well, but due to the wonky and weird banlist, i think its at its worst here. You better REALLY enjoy seeing the same 3 decks, because once you get past bronze its ALLLLL youre ever going to see for the rest of your life.

Seventh point: While this is not 100% proven yet, there is evidence to suggest the game is bias for asian players. Letting asian players start every duel with 3 different handtraps plus 2 different 1 card starters every single game whilst giving the english players 3 same named HOPT cards and 2 extenders that can't play through 3 hand traps. Or for the first time in 20 duels you open maxx c but AWWW DIDNT MATTER because the asian player opened ash, 2 starters, and extender, TTT, and maxx c themselves. It happens SO often and is almost always exlusively from asian players, that I am convinced the game plays favorites.

eighth point: The community is ULTRA toxic. No one is helpful, everyone is hostile, and everyone thinks theyre king of games while everyone else is worthless peasents. Any time you complain about ANYTHING its always ""skill issue"" (despite 50% of the game being luck) No, its not ""skill issue"" that konami themselves wanted the opponent to win and gave them 4 hand traps and a starter whilst not giving me and handtraps or breakers, thats RNG, not skill.


Overall, I simply can NOT recommend this horrible game to anyone who values their life or sanity. If you enjoy being screwed over by RNG while everyone who you simply ask for help or tips from mock you, go ahead, but no thanks. Im good.",False,1,0,1764173621

From the start of the game to the credit roll, Nier is a pleasant and melancholic game that pours a lot of attention into its side quests to paint a picture of life in a dying world.  It's a game as much about loving the NPCs struggling day after day as it is about its character-driven main story.

However, you may be aware that Nier is a game with multiple endings.  Rather than a choice of parallel endings that you see in many RPGs, this game follows from Drakengard and VNs in having sequential endings that build upon each other.  Or at least, they try to.

The positive part of my review ends at the credit roll for Ending A.  (Or a little after—the backstory you get for Kainé just after is also easily worthwhile.)  To reach the other endings, you have to repeat sections of the game again and again and again.  The actual new content is minimal—just a few extra cutscenes stretched thin across old bones.  What new content there is is rarely interesting, instead repeating or expanding emotional points that were already present in the original playthrough and could've been included the first time around.  The personality flaws of the main cast go unexplored, and the extra characterisation for your enemies changes the story from a tragedy into a tone-deaf farce.  Meanwhile, what emotional impact the story originally had is scrubbed off as you sit through the same scenes again and again, waiting for it to be over.

It should also be noted that combat itself is very shallow, and really doesn't stand up to replay.  By my final run of the ending boss gauntlet, I had figured out several points [i]during combat[/i] where I was free to scroll on my phone while button mashing or evading one-handed, barely glancing at the game screen.

Graphics that haven't been updated or even made for pc YEP.  Awful ""power up"" (word edit) system yep. Things that are left unexplained and just don't make sense YEP.

Another Awful thing about this game is there are things that take up a ridiculous amount of time and that are very unnecessary and annoying. There are parts where it MAKES YOU WALK and not just lil parts, When you're searching for EMIL you have to walk the entire time through the mansion at a snails pace and it really really makes it agonizing.. same with the light house, same with the boat, its weird and very very aggravating. One other horrible thing is basically there is NO FAST TRAVEL you spend hours running back and fourth between the same 4 places eventually they give you a guy on a boat that can take you places but hes always so far outta the way and not easy to get to that you might as well just run because you're gonna get there in the same amount a time give or take a few seconds.

This game was so lazy that instead of making a village they made a small room with trees in it with 4 npcs that were ""townspeople"".. Instead of it being a new area with a new boss.. its a ""dream forest"" where the mayor talks to you in text as if you were part of their dream and you fall victim to a ""death dream""
disease. The game then reads you PAGES of text and if you don't answer the changing text correct;y you have to start over and that my friends is one of the bosses/stages. Its most def one of the laziest things ive ever seen.

The games story isn't so bad it really isn't but if you're looking for a game like NeiR:Automata you're going to be extremely disappointed. I played through every single ending hoping something fun was gonna happen... instead i played the same exact thing 4 times out of 5 with the 5th being the weakest ending... ever.

But its 2021 remaster assumes it still fits the modern gaming landscape and has something fresh to offer. Unfortunately, it falls short.
The world feels empty and generic, the visuals are mediocre, and the gameplay mechanics are dated—reduced to following dots on a map and completing trivial fetch quests. Combat is shallow, with limited abilities and builds, repetitive enemies, problematic camera angles, and virtually no environmental sound design. Long, tiring walks and constant backtracking through the same locations make the experience feel like a chore. Worst of all, the game forces players to replay the same content up to five times to see the full story.
Had I played it back in 2010, I might have felt differently. I'm not sure because some thing would still bother me. But releasing it at full AAA price in 2021 invites comparison to modern titles—and by today’s standards, it simply doesn’t deserve your time or money.


Manometer: 4/10[/b]  


The good
- Interesting concept: The lore is rich and later became the backbone of ""Nier Automata"". The writing explores philosophical themes and occasionally becomes poetic. The text-adventure-style segments are especially beautiful.
- Well-crafted characters: Though a bit stereotypical, the main cast has vivid personalities that are easy to love.
- Despite the empty world and average visuals, the game creates a haunting, fairy-tale-like ambiance.
- The soundtrack is stunning and enhances the mood—though it plays constantly and can become overwhelming.
- Voice acting performances lean toward the epic rather than realistic, but they effectively convey each character’s personality and intent
- Nice, fluid animations with smooth transitions between moves. The feeling on the controller is great. It's nice that most weapons have different move sets.
- Well designed boss battles. Uniquely designed encounters that blend platforming mechanics with reflex-based challenges
- Battles are mediocre yet mixing melee attacks with projectile magic is a nice idea that adds a layer of depth.
- A subtle, clever sense of humor lightens the tone without becoming silly.

The bad
- I know it's a 2010 game, yet I was expecting more in this remaster especially after the ""Nier Automata"" success. Most models are low-poly, textures are poor (sometimes tiled), and the world feels repetitive and generic. Invisible walls and frequent loading screens break immersion.
- Again, this is a remaster of an older game but in 2021 a lot of things look obsolete. It's open world logic is completely worn forcing you to blindly follow markers on the map. A lot of the main objectives look like fetch quest as you have to go to various characters to see what they need. Its world is too small with only a few regions that the game forces you to visit again and again to face different enemies that weren't there before. In addition to that each region is usually filled with copy-paste corridors. All this repetition makes it boring.
- Shallow RPG mechanics. Few abilities and weapon combinations mean limited build diversity. New gear is usually just a straight upgrade, removing strategic choices.
- You have to walk into unbelievable long distances. Quests often send you back and forth to the same locations with minimal shortcuts. A lot of times after beating all the enemies in a region and fulfilling the objective, you have to backtrack though empty rooms. The fast travel mechanics that it offers are silly and don't alleviate the grind.
- Battle is mediocre. Despite teaching various tactics, most fights devolve into button-mashing chaos. A lot of battles become an indistinct blend of enemies and balls. It usually feels like they're undesigned. In addition to that healing or using items via menu pauses breaks the flow and feels outdated
- Except from the bosses, regular enemies are completely generic. Aside from bosses, most foes are indistinct black shapes with no unique traits. They just filled every region with the same enemies. Easily some of the most boring encounters I've ever met in a video game.
- Pointless side quests: Tasks like “bring an egg” or “fetch a watermelon” lack narrative depth and disrupt the main story’s vibes and continuity. Overall pacing is problematic Repeated visits to the library to speak with Popola feel unimaginative.
- It has multiple endings, yet after the first playthrough it becomes a chore. While multiple playthroughs reveal new story elements, they require replaying large portions of the game with no changes at all. Unlike ""Nier Automata"" which offered fresh perspectives and gameplay shifts it forces you even to go through repeated dialogues smashing the skip button just to unlock a few new cutscenes. It's an unbelievable choice that they punish you with this boring repetitiveness if you want to learn the whole story. Even more unbelievable is that you have to find all weapons in order to go through ending C.
- Cameras are weird and problematic. The camera often fails to follow the protagonist properly, and manual rotation is sluggish. Sudden shifts to top-down or side-view angles are too often feel arbitrary and disorienting—unlike ""Automata, where such changes were purposeful and enhanced gameplay. Here all these side scrolling platforming sessions and scenes that look like old arcades seem to be rushed and not so successful.
- Boss battles are well designed with some interesting mechanics, yet this thing with their health bars is a joke. These are inconsistent and confusing. Bars refill or change without clear logic, making it hard to gauge progress and turning them into a gimmick.
- Despite the deep lore and the good writing the the core narrative is basic and often relies on melodramatic clichés like self-sacrifice or excessive epic moments. 
- There is no environmental sound design at all. Here music dominates every scene, leaving no room for ambient sounds that could enhance immersion. Even moments of silence would have added depth.
- Ok it's not a puzzle game but if you decide to put some of them in there better make them interesting. The few puzzle rooms are overly simplistic and feel like filler content for children.
- Unbalanced difficulty. The game is generally too easy.. You will die only one or two time during a few boss battles. There is no challenge at all. Also, In subsequent playthroughs enemies remain mid-game strong while you’re at new game++ level. They cannot even touch you and you almost one hit kill them. Really boring.",False,3,1,1759763348

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198117360203,"I played Automata back in 2017. Being much younger, tolerating stuff like ""you have to beat the game 3 times to reach the ending"" wasn't really an issue. Now in 2025, I sadly do not have the same free time to spend it on games like Replicant.

First things first. This game should have been a complete remake. This game actually feels like a very good remaster, in the sense that you feel like you are playing a PS3 game. The problem is, this remaster was released in 2021. So many other very good games came out that year so we dont really have much when it comes to technology not being enough. Toylogic simply didn't take any risks. The gameplay is incredibly stale, upgrades are mostly unnecessary and boring, spells are pretty fun for the first couple of hours but then get forgotten. The game nearly always felt like a chore to play. And I had to finish the game twice (Well actually 3 times if you want to see the real ending but i couldnt be arsed and watched it on youtube.) They really should have mishmashed Automata's different weapon styles with Reincarnation's spells to make it unique.

Enemies. Boring. Small dude. Big dude. Big dude with shield. Even bigger dude. Even bigger dude with shield. The bosses were pretty cool but there sadly are 5 of them and you are constantly put against them because of the repetition which kills their uniqueness. Again, extremely boring due to repetitiveness. Which is a very common issue with the game overall.

Scenery. It is pretty decent looking. For a PS3 game. For a remaster that was released in 2021, it looks bleak, the colors are dead and the settings are just bland. Some scenes were pretty but I never got the same feeling I got from Automata's introductions to new areas. 

Characters. Now this is a strange topic because Nier games are all about mystery and being attached to these characters who are put through hell for us to enjoy. I don't like the brother sister troupe so it was a miss for me (which is a personal thing and not an objective critisism) but the tones the characters give off is very weird. Nier, the main dude, is basically a slave. First to his sister, then to the villagers, then to his comrades, and finally to the village leaders. He is one of those main characters who never asks anything and just helps people around for the sake of helping. Then does a complete 180 and becomes something completely else. With no buildup, it just doesn't work. Side characters are pretty unique but without spoilers, I don't really like how they evolve as well. They lose their uniqueness while becoming generic with each minute you spend together.

And yes. The story. Yes, Yoko Taro fashion, it tells a very unique story with intense twists and turns. But I highly doubt it's worth the 35+ hour slogfest of mashing 2 buttons while going from marker to a marker. My recommendation is just read / watch an explanation about the story and skip to NieR: Automata.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561199025497003,"Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a tactical role-playing game that revitalizes the classic CRPG formula with depth, freedom, and smart writing. It combines strategic turn-based combat, meaningful player choice, and cooperative gameplay to create one of the most complete role-playing experiences of its generation.

The story follows two Source Hunters investigating a mysterious murder in the city of Cyseal, gradually uncovering a plot that threatens the fabric of reality. The narrative is layered with humor, moral ambiguity, and philosophical undertones. Dialogue choices matter, influencing character relationships, quests, and even combat outcomes.

Gameplay is defined by its interactivity. Almost every object, surface, and environmental element can be manipulated. Fire spreads, water conducts electricity, and poison ignites. Combat becomes a puzzle where creative thinking often wins over brute force. This system rewards experimentation, not repetition.

Character creation and progression are flexible. Players can customize skills, attributes, and abilities without being locked into rigid classes. Cooperative play enhances this freedom—two players can explore, argue over choices, or separate to pursue different objectives simultaneously. The resulting dynamics make co-op feel organic rather than forced.

Visually, the Enhanced Edition improves textures, lighting, and interface clarity while keeping the game’s distinct hand-painted fantasy style. The redesigned UI and full voice acting make exploration and dialogue more immersive. Every conversation and environment feels alive and reactive.

The writing maintains a balance between wit and seriousness. Quests often carry multiple solutions, and morality is never simple. Whether you’re solving a murder, arguing with a talking shell, or deciding the fate of an entire village, the game constantly invites critical thinking and reflection.

In essence, Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a masterclass in player agency and tactical depth. It’s challenging, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Every decision feels personal, every victory earned through intellect and creativity. It stands as one of the finest examples of modern role-playing design rooted in classic principles.",True,1,0,1762683612

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198160031418,"This game to me is one that deserves a mixed rating. While I liked the game and had fun playing it, there were plenty of times  when it felt more of a slog to get through. The world is semi open-world that is both good and bad. Constant Saving felt like a must

Starting off, making my characters was fun, there were a good amount of classes to choose from. Playing around with some starting skill options, personal customization was ok nothing too crazy for the Two Player Characters you create as my heroes.
A few voices to choose from, personalities etc. Not everything in the game is voiced, most MC dialogue gets voiced with their little side quips, side characters here and there, most dialogue will be read. A few companions to choose from, I choose two and rocked with them, since I believe if you swap them in later their level's won't match yours, needs more testing?

Combat was fun and not fun, while it worked and gave me chances to be creative with combining the environment, items I have, spells and such to fight, it meant the enemy could do the same. With the world being open-ish often I'd find myself in fights I wasn't going to win, the battles can drag on since the AI sometime is fast, othertimes It's like Internet Explorer making a turn. Getting wiped just to fight the same long tedious fight drags on, trying multiple strats just to get perma stunned by 5+ enemies. The wide variety of spells and weapon types means you have to adjust based on the enemy, with some damage types healing them, (my best weapons healed the final boss, that was fun).

Locales/Vibes- locations looked great, it felt like an adventure, from simple beaches (how original lol) to ancient caves and tombs to spirit realms & even to the ends of time. In the same vein some locations were terrible, like the Luculla Sandstorm,  nothing was fun about making a conga line with my party to pull the enemy, spending 20 minutes to beat a enemy then running away to escape combat and teleport away just to rinse and repeat. 
There are traps and secrets hidden in the world, things like hidden grave to lava traps.

Puzzles, some felt fun and rewarding, while the majority were just annoying and killed the pace and fun of the game, You'll need to be used to separating your party and multi-tasking with them, along with reading everything ever. Or needing very ""specific"" weights needed on weight plates. Many of them feel like they're trying to be overly clever and are doing too much imo. 

This is the kind of game where you need to interact and talk with everyone and everything, which takes forever. Even then you'll still miss things and interactions. If only I realized my choices in events that gave my character points in their personality things like ""vindictive, pragmatic, romantic"" etc actually affected my character stats and potential dialogue options that could lock you out of things. Along with knowing what items can actually be dragged onto others to work.

To me, this game would make one do new runs over and over to fix their mistakes if they get softlocked. So yeah you could respec everything except personality points from dialog and benefits/detriments, but what if you lose your skills? So what if i can buy them again or craft them again except the skills for my Knight and ranger? Ones that can't be gotten again? I committed to my build and mistake and suffered for it. Some skills felt useless and were a waste of precious talent points. My rogue had near max stealth skill, and I was still getting discovered, so I just used his ""Make Invisible"" skill which actually worked and was 1000x better.

Quick Side note, Don't sell Tenebrium items to merchants, I then had to deal with dying merchants for the rest of the game, I kept alive with my mage spamming Rejuvenates.

An annoyance to me was near the end game, I couldn't progress past a door needing me to have Blood stone/Star Stones, story/lore items that also double as ""full party heals"" basically omega tier heals. It said I didn't have enough but I already went everywhere I could ingame. So there I was backtracking the whole game searching high and low for these supposed stones. I found one, the only last one, but he still wouldn't open. How was I supposed to know I needed to use my rare healing stones? Then after that go to my homebase to talk to some merchants for the door to then open saying I was then worthy.

While I did enjoy my time with this game, those moments were here and there bogged down by slow moments, overtuned encounters, overly annoying puzzles, slow combat and general shenanigans one would expect from this style of game. Again I say to better enjoy the game, it'd take multiple runs/attempts. It'd be more fun for me now that I know how it plays out and how to spec better. I'd recommend it to people who like this type of game and difficulty, however to the casual RPG gamer who just wants to have easy fun without thinking, no stress kind of thing, this isn't for you.",False,0,1,1760780429

The humor? Chef's kiss.
The characters? Absolute chaos goblins with personality.
The graphics? Weirdly gorgeous for a game that’s not exactly new anymore. Honestly, half the time I forgot this thing came out years ago, because everything looks like it has been polished by a team of very dedicated fantasy elves.

And the classes? Amazing. You can basically create anything from a teleporting rogue assassin who politely stabs people in the face… to a necromantic violinist who heals by bleeding on things. Truly art.

But then… Source Points happen.

Ah, yes. Source Points. The magical energy that fuels your strongest abilities, your coolest spells, is needed to acomplish dungeons/quests, and—apparently—your greatest frustration in life.

It’s not that the game limits you on them. That would actually be interesting, right? Making tough choices, thinking strategically, feeling the weight of your decisions?

Nope.
Divinity says: “You can refill them endlessly, dear player!”
And then quietly adds:
“…Just run back and forth like a lost chicken to do it.”

Why?
Why give me infinite refills… but only if I prove my dedication by jogging across Rivellon like I’m training for a marathon?
Why ruin the pacing of such a brilliant game with a mechanic that feels like an unpaid internship?

Instead of epic adventure, I get Source Point Fetch Quest Simulator 2017.

And that’s when my enthusiasm died a dramatic, theatrical death. Not by combat. Not by a boss. But by pure, uncut inconvenience. It’s like the game whispered:
""You like fun? Too bad. Go touch another puddle of ghost juice, peasant.""

So, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is still an incredible game with unforgettable humor, beautiful visuals, and rich gameplay.
But Source Points?
Yeah, no. Hard pass. When a mechanic makes me feel like I’m clocking in for my shift, I put down the controller and walk away.

Final Verdict:
A masterpiece held hostage by a mechanic that thinks I have the free time of a bored god. If Larian ever patches Source Points into something less annoying, I’m back in. Until then… Rivellon, it’s not you. It’s your weird energy system.",False,1,1,1763244560

Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198133077347,"I really would love to like this game. It has engaging combat, a great multiplayer and interactivity that I have not seen before.
The start at Fort Joy is amazing to play. It's the best balanced and the most well-rounded. I always knew where to go, always found new things to explore and I never felt lost story wise.

All of this starts to turn around in the following acts and I feel like it gets worse or at least more glaring the further you progress. 
These glaring issues for me are:

[b] ""Open World"" [/b]
On Fort Joy the open world felt rewarding. The battles were challenging but beatable. So, I was delighted to see what may come after Fort Joy.

What I ended up finding were ""natural"" level barriers that forced my friend and I to follow a linear route to so that we could beat the battles (note that we played on normal).
Finding this linear route after the game told us to pick and choose where we wish to go next just felt confusing. In total it took us a month to progress (we played once every week). We desperately staked out which area might be appropriate for our level 12 characters. I still remember each area of the second act and which level is associated with. 
Perhaps we where unfortunate to not have chosen this path. Mayhaps, we simply overread an important dialog pointing us towards the right direction.
The only thing I know for sure is that the only for us beatable area was [spoiler]in the top left corner[/spoiler] of the map.

You have to pass multiple other areas with higher levels to get there.
Nevertheless, this area was still a mighty struggle. We fought with everything we had. We strategized about each battle. After every loss we took notes, regrouped and attacked again. Every potential ""exploit"" we could see, we utilized.

This level of tenacity does not feel appropriate for a normal difficulty playthrough at least not for me.

[u]Recommendation[/u]
The pre-set levels with the exponential leveling system to not work together with the ""open world"" aspect of the game.
I'll get more in-depth with the leveling in the next part, but giving the player the directive to ""reign freely"" while setting fixed levels to the enemies does not add up. 
Adjusting the enemies to the level the player is feels way more appropriate. Maybe, sprinkle in some fixed levels as a boss to really stop the player if the story demands it, but putting this everywhere is just misguided. 

Especially since it let to us loosing track of the story completely. We started each quests, but we could never finish them due to the battles. So after a week or two we came back to the quest without having a clue of what was going on. (The in-game journal is quite lack luster on this regard)

[b]Levelling[/b]
In total you can get up to level [spoiler]21[/spoiler], which feels a little low looking at other RPGs. The issue I have with this is that you are at level [spoiler]12 when leaving Fort Joy[/spoiler]. This leads to the weird situation that levels are exponentially more important the closer you get to the max level.

At first you may be able to win a battle against a two levels higher foe, but towards the end if you are not on the same level as your enemy, you get demolished.
We literally couldn't defeat the final boss since we were one level below it. Coincidentally, we also were at a point were we felt like we completed every quest available to us. After trying for another fruitless three weeks, we loaded a previous save and tried to squeeze out another level so we have even an inkling of a chance.

As a [u]recommendation[/u] I can just offer a proper re-balancing of the later areas and a plead for general level cap increase. In the last stages of the game seeing the next level XP requirement to be in the millions is disheartening.

[b]Quest Management[/b]
A more minute point but it feels like the bad cherry on top of the issue cake. 
The in-game journal feels in-adequate to help the player remember story points and even gist's of quests. The best you can hope for is a red marker on your map, and a small to-do entry. The point of the quest, the afflicted affiliations and the severity are often not included. 

Especially after our 3-week excursion through level barrier hell, we essentially reached a point of mindless ""red flag grinding"". I at least felt like a zombie trying to stave my XP-hunger by any means possible. So, every found quest was like a 3-star prepared meal and I devoured it as far as I could, but the chef seemed to hate me and always put glass shards in the food so that I had to come back to it later after my gums were accustomed to the ""difficulty"" (Essentially I needed to level to beat a foe)

Everything combined together let to me loosing completely any inkling of the story.

A small anecdote concerning story. My friend and I felt like we managed to skip great chunks of it unwillingly. One example for this is the story around Gareth.

For me it felt as follows: [spoiler]The great leader Gareth managed to escape the prison island Fort Joy with the help of his divine acquaintances (us). Together they set sail to Reaper's Coast where Gareth's parents resided. He immediately went to his parents but Magisters seemed to have been a step ahead of him. The battle did not take long, but neither did the triumph. Beneath rubble lay two corpses ... his parents. Silently he buried them. A deep anger begins taking hold of Gareth. Before he could do anything reckless his two divine acquaintances appear. He told them what happened. The trio stood there silently. Until one divine spoke up: ""It is what it is, bro"".

These words quiet the anger immediately and Gareth went back to the ship never do to anything of note again.
[/spoiler] 

I do not know how one should experience his tale but this is beyond ridiculous.

This was roughly the experience I had with almost all of the story points which is why during the end credits I felt like I was being introduced to new characters since I could not for the life of me remember who any of the characters even where.

My [u]recommendation[/u] for this one would be to add more information to the journal, and to add a glossary to keep track of the different parties, their goals and what the situation currently is. The chapters setup did not help at all. It rather added to the confusion because some quests where chapter-overlapping, so they never disappeared.

[b]Gear[/b]
I had a very unique problem with gear throughout the whole game. Namely, I was often stuck with too low leveled gear because of set combos. These set combos gave me unique traits which I liked, but I could never transition smoothly to a new set due to bonuses of the set combo.

So my solution would be to upgrade my gear, but there is no way to level up gear. There is a DLC-esque bundle modifications containing the gear sisters. Which adds four sister merchants in the game which sell you (limited) quantities of gear upgrade ingredients. Even if you managed to pay their insanely steep prices (easily 10k per PIECE). Their limited quantity would not even allow you to upgrade a full set of unique gear ONCE.

I re-iterate my final gear that was a 5 piece armor set, was physically not possible to be upgraded fully ONCE even if I collected ALL the armor upgrade ingredients.

[u]Recommendation[/u]: Please let me upgrade my gear, I'm begging you.

[b]Overall[/b], I think the game has a fantastic premise, but these points just gave me such frustration while playing that I simply felt saddened by the thought of what could be. If I'm just unlucky with how my playthrough went please tell me what I could have done. I'd really love to find my appreciation again for this game.",False,2,0,1762818932
Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198051875226,"Crashes frequently. Different places, different times, whether playing a few minutes or for longer periods of time. Crashes in Fort Joy walking into arena. Crashes in Reaper's Coast. Game simply exits. No error message, warning, or indication about to exit. Just back to desktop.

Windows recommended compatibility settings for Windows 8. Larian support page recommended running game directly without Steam. Still crashes on windows 10. Played fine for a while. Then doesn't play fine. 

Camera is visually disorienting when edge panning due to elevation changes (trees, cliffs, anything similar). Camera jumps high, jumps low. When scrolling around to see where to go, find a chest, road, or something, this is just plain awful.

Find a place you want to go on the big map? No way to click a point and instruct party to go there. Exit map and walk there bit by bit or scroll the area (with that disorienting up / down camera going across terrain), find your spot, click and hope your party doesn't stop for ground obstructions or obstacles.

Mario 64 has better camera free look than Divinity OS 1 or 2.  That's on Nintendo 64! 
I don't know how beta testers didn't get headaches from this camera in Divinity 2.

General rule of thumb appears to be destroy opponents before they get turns. Enemy turns take a long time. Sometimes, game decides to think about what to do (I guess?) so a minute or so later, finally completes that opponent's turn. Now do it again for the other 5+ in the fight. No way to skip this waiting.

Battles are so monotonous on enemy turns, I do something in another monitor. Maybe that's why I get crashes ... trying to play windowed. I don't know. Battles are time consuming and boring. Wait, wait, and wait some more. Oh, you're incapacitated? No turn for you. Now wait again. Oh, look, still incapacitated. Just reload game, try to knock them into incapacitated statuses first. Or just explore elsewhere, come back with another level or two, and wonder why they were difficult at all.

Some waypoints should be closer, especially when a story quest sends you somewhere repeatedly. 

The quest log ... is unusable the more quests appear on the list. No search option. So you play along, get a message such and such quest updated, go to look. Spend 20 minute reading them line by line looking for this quest that IS NOT THERE!! Where is it? I don't know. I saw the message, I know the name. I can google it. I cannot find it in the log. The log is USELESS clutter. The internet is easier if you're looking for a particular quest, details, story, or what to do. The built in quest log in this game is unusable as it enlarges with various quest tidbits. A search feature would help immensely here. Same for inventory for finding something. Some prankster designed a chest that you must be in precisely the right camera position to actually reach. Thankfully, there's a skill to just put stuff like that into your inventory without that level of work. After 5 minutes of trying to copy from a youtube video, I gave up and used the spell. That's just bad design.

Game's a time suck. Get used to it eventually. Pace of combat is slow. You can click faster than the game is ready, ending up walking somewhere instead of actually using a skill from your hotbar. Camera is horrible for elevation up / downs. Other games have similar jerkiness in their camera movements as well. This game, you have to look around and that's difficult to have occur so much, even just rotating around to see the terrain for a battle.

Oh, and my favorite is staring at the game waiting for combat to advance only to see the message: Not your character's turn. Have to go click on your portrait to do your turn. The game didn't put it there automatically. Seems random when it occurs.

 I must've put in 30+ hours without a crash. Then, one day, crash after crash. Install new software? No. Change drivers? No. Skip playing a week or so, then put in a long time - all the way to Arx with maybe two crashes. Fire up next day, try a new game for kicks to experiment, four crashes before even escape Fort Joy. That's not fun.

Divinity OS 2 has easier inventory management (still a pain with a lot of stuff) and equipping gear, spells, etc. than Divinity 1. Game 1 is more stable on my windows 10. Game 2 crashes - a lot. That's what sucks the fun right out of number 2.

Also, divinity 2 has less of all that creepy blood emphasis of game 1.
It just crashes repeatedly :(

The graphics are pretty good for everything other than the people, and if that's a sticking point for you then I would still recommend going with the remaster either via upgrade or buying it outright.
There is a good range on difficulty from Very Easy, to Ultra Hard. I personally found it to be best on Hard/Very Hard as it makes you use more of your tools, but I also find the jump from Very Hard to Ultra Hard to be a bit much compared to the others.

The writing is... mediocre. Many points are rehashed several times on several different occasions and the dialogue swings wildly between stock NPC templates and amusing if not interesting characters, most of which I find to be located in the DLC. To its credit the few times the game gives you a choice in how to respond it feels like the choice is actually different from the others, but they do all lead to the same point in the end.

The combat has unique systems, and a good number of monsters to fight, even with a fifth of them being some flavor of ""large cat with a gun strapped to it back"". There probably could have been a bit more variety in monster types, but the ones that do exist each have their own strengths and weakness to exploit, so combat feels more engaging than just ""hit the thing till it dies"".

First and foremost, there are a lot of things that were improved on:
- more and varying enemies
- improved area details
- more content
- improved graphics
- incredibly beautiful music
- world feels much more alive 

HOWEVER, here are my nitpicks:
- WAY too many abilities (my controller buddies will understand that one)
- parasitic game design with the abilities 
- puzzles are less creative than from the predecessor
- story is alright, however it feels like a downgrade from the story of the predecessor and doesn't make a whole lot of sense at certain points

At times it feels like the game is an Ori game in name alone. I REALLY liked the first game for what it made different from most games. I don't really understand why Ori needed weapons in this game? Especially since they feel a bit off for a character like Ori. 
Sure, Sein existed in the predecessor. Which you could technically count as a weapon. And certainly the first game had a lot of different ways to engage with enemies (stomp, throwing them into thorns, throwing glowing balls at them, throwing their own projectiles back, etc.). Perhaps I'm just thrown off that Ori was given swords, a giant frying pan, bows, spears, etc. in this game. Might just be me tho.
The sheer amount of different trees that can be found throughout the game make the trees much less special to find over time.
I remember playing blind forest for the first time and getting very excited for every tree I found. In ""Will of the Wisps"" finding trees does get tiring after a while due to the sheer oversaturation of them (not to mention all the other stuff you can find, like shards). 

I kind of wish that Ku would've played a bigger role/would've been playable for longer. 

At times it feels like the devs tried making a different game, but had to use the Ori IP for it (That's just my tinfoil hat theory tho, lmao)

If you expect puzzles like in ""blind forest"", this is not really the game for you. Stick with the first game.
This game focusses much more on combat and for that it's well done. The bosses are challenging and enjoyable (My favorite is Mora). Less abilities or a different way to implement them all would've been preferred from my point of view.
If you want a lot of bosses, play the Hollow Knight series instead.",True,0,0,1764182551

The early parts are simple, mainly teaching basic actions. As the game goes on, the paths get more complex and the obstacles become trickier.

The devs really nailed the visual polish—every scene element has smooth, detailed animations that make the world feel lively, and the extra layering gives the whole game a stronger sense of depth. There are also a lot of smart quality-of-life touches that other Metroidvania-style games should definitely learn from: the death penalty isn’t excessive, there’s no pointless grind or “trash time” and the speedrun challenges are super efficient to retry. Mess up? Boom—instant restart. And when you finish a run, it sends u right back to the starting point eliminating unnecessary waiting or backtracking. Plus, all hidden items can be collected before finishing the game, so you never get permanently locked out just becuz the story moved forward.
[b]Downsides:[/b] Map opens with an awkward lag and doesn’t remember ur zoom level. The pacing falls off right before the end—there’s one brutally hard area that completely breaks the flow. New soundtrack doesn’t have any standout tracks, mainstory is pretty forgettable, and the guidance toward new areas is really unclear.

Why am I here? 

Devs...when *I* play a game and spend hours unlocking abilities. I want to use those abilities. Seems pretty straight forward?

I really enjoyed this game but there were a few pain points which makes me hesitate to recommend it to my friends. The over-arching theme of my issues with the game can be summarized with 'I don't know what to do / where to go' - I should note I went into the game completely blind having only played ori 1 so I had no pre-info about the game.

1: some mechanical kbm skill is required to play(/enjoy?) the game, but people who have the needed kbm skills will probably figure out pretty early on that some melee attacks can give you some extra air time, allowing you to bypass obstacles and reach areas you shouldn't reach. I thought I was being clever by juggling my way up ridges and plateaus or by being able to get the relatively expensive triple jump as soon as I saw the merchant, but in reality I was progressing more than I actually should have been leading me to get stuck multiple times and sometimes even having to use back-up saves.


2: fake solutions (things that seem plausible but are not the solution). Example: I used the bash ability to juggle an enemy along in mouldwood depths (they provide light) to reach a location which I thought held a secret, but it was actually part of the natural progression of the game I had to go to later. It wasn't always clear to me what was a secret and what was natural progression of the game where I really shouldn't have had access to, and boy did this happen often.
One more example would be the soup kettle in the glades, I had not been introduced to the mechanic of fanning (with the feather, like bellows) the fire of the cooking pot to get it to erupt something and I think I didn't even have the flap ability at this point in the game, as I reached this area through 'clever use of game mechanics'. So here I am spending 15 minutes seeing whether the monster has to use his axe on the floor to break the ice (plausible solution), or whether maybe I had to buy the blaze ability to melt stuff (plausible solution) and so forth. When I finally did get the instruction of having to use the fanning to get it to erupt I thought I had to redirect the fireball to the ice via bashing to break it (plausible solution) and was very disappointed when it didn't.

The most egregious one was in the ice zone and I actually had to google how to pass this, but it's where a wall of ice is blocking the final door keystone and there's a kettle nearby. Above you is a monster that erupts when you get close and shoots a projectile at you, from what I could tell these monsters are used almost exclusively to provide you with a projectile to bash off of. Now right in front of the kettle is a wooden plank on which you can stand, but projectiles pass through, and this is demonstrated very clearly with the aforementioned monster. When you drop down into it the only point of interest is a shrine that needs to be lit up, so every fiber of my intuitive-game-logic is telling me that I need to fan the pot and redirect the fireball into this area, but it just isn't working and I can't figure it out. Turns out there's a shrine much further down which had to be hit by the projectile.

3: minimap. I am naturally a bit 'lost' when it comes to navigating, both in real life and in videogames, so this isn't really a stab at the world being hard to navigate but rather about how cumbersome it is to keep having to load up the map (which takes a while btw!) to check where exactly I am and have to go. I would much rather have a sort of 'overlay' map option that I can toggle freely without it having to load.
Perhaps some sort of arrow indicator would be nice too, to remind me where I'm going (before anyone says this breaks immersion: loading up the minimap every 10 seconds also breaks immersion). I'm thinking similar to what BioShock would use.

Finally, the minimap could highlight some things better, like points of interest. In Kwolok's cave (or whatever it was called) there's a door that's unlocked by pulling a lever after redirecting a bolt to destroy a purple wall, and for whatever reason I had done all of this except pull the lever and I couldn't figure out how to open the door, I had done pretty much everything else there was to do at this point in the game regarding the main storyline and was stuck. I had to google it (which made me go 'duh, how did I miss that'), it would be nice if it would just indicate on the minimap that there was a lever there. At the end of the game when you're killing creeper hearts it shows where the teleportation funnels lead to with dotted lines, can't we have something similar for levers and things? I'm just a bit of an idiot, I need the extra guidance (although I did immediately realize what the bell music puzzle was and how to solve it, but that's probably because I played the Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus games a million times).

4. speedruns are annoying to watch
Too much menu'ing, interestingly something that plagued the first game as well and it's even worse here. I enjoy looking at different types of speedruns after I've completed the game but the menu'ing is just so annoying, even in categories which restrict menu'ing. I would have hoped that the devs (who I KNOW some of to be speedrun enthusiasts) would have added a 'speedrun' mode of the game which unlocks after having finished the game, that automatically skips things like cutscenes and prevents saving/loading (aside from autosaves like when you die in game), perhaps even has an in-built tracker (which the normal game already kind of has).

Overall this was an enjoyable game that I do not regret buying but I did find myself more frustrated than I would ideally like to have been and also far more than I have been in other types of games, and unfortunately this frustration was not a good type of frustration. I didn't feel like I overcame a challenge when I got frustrated, but rather 'I wish this was made more obvious to me' or 'oh God do I really have to backtrack that much? there's no spirit well to warp to?'

FWIW: It took me just under 15 hrs to finish the game on a blind normal playthrough at around 65% completion if the in-game time is to be believed.

EDIT: one more thing I forgot, the limited (3) ability options at the same point in time. I knew from the moment I saw the wheel of abilities with the potential spots available that at some point in time I was going to have overlap between abilities (as in, for example: I always have a certain ability on X and swap it out for another ability when needed, but now there's an area where I need both of these abilities, which means I want to press X for both of them due to muscle memory). Did we really need to limit this to 3 slots?

It's a Metroidvania, so the map opens up as the player explores and unlocks new abilities. The problem is that, unlike Symphony of the Night or other classic titles in the genre, Ori and the Will of the Wisps lets you go incredibly far in the wrong direction before you discover you can't progress because you're missing a key ability. A better game would lock its paths behind the abilities you need for completing them. In other words, if you need the bash ability to reach the end of a hallway, a well-designed game would require you to use bash to even [i] access [/i] that hallway in the first place. It would not waste your time, allowing you to wander down the impassable hallway for several minutes, before discovering at the end of it all that you don't actually have the ability to proceed. At the very least, a better game would branch that hallway into other areas you [i] can [/i] access so you're not stuck backtracking for hours on end.

This isn't a tiny gripe. It's a key problem with the way the game progresses. Map design is absolutely crucial to a Metroidvania, and Ori has a poorly designed map. A good Metroidvania gently nudges the player in the right direction. If you discover you can't reach the path to the next boss, there's likely a route somewhere nearby that will unlock a crucial ability for defeating that boss. Since Ori never locks any of its routes, getting lost means getting [i] really [/i] lost. You start to wonder if you're going the wrong way or if you're just missing something hiding in plain sight.

A perfect example: I couldn't access an area of the game called the Wellspring. It turns out, I needed to use an ability to redirect enemy projectiles to open a door. The game never explained that I [i] could [/i] redirect enemy projectiles. It simply told me to use the redirection ability for movement, and that's all it required me to do with it for a very long time. So I was stuck for over an hour trying to get the enemy to shoot the door itself, trying to unlock a new path, and trying to find a new ability I [i] thought [/i] I was missing, all because the game failed to demonstrate the projectile-redirecting ability before it was crucial for progression. A good game teaches the player how to use a new ability in a low-stakes situation before progressing to a high-stakes one—essentially taking the training wheels off. A bad game expects the player to know the mechanics automatically, even when they aren't intuitive.

Ori just doesn't understand how game ""psychology"" works. A lot of negative reviews say the game is too hard. I disagree with that. The game is just badly designed, so it makes itself harder than it needs to be. Are you jumping incorrectly, or are you missing a power-up? Is the door ahead of you locked, or is there some secondary use for an ability you already have? Those are questions that lead to frustration. A Metroidvania should feel rewarding to play. It should be addictive to unlock new areas and create a stronger character. It should not grind to a halt every thirty seconds and leave you wondering if you're missing something.

Aside from that, while the graphics are beautiful, the main character is small, and the camera is pulled too far back. It's easy to lose sight of Ori on screen, especially when there's a light shining in the background behind him. The environments are lush to the point of sacrificing visual clarity. It's sometimes hard to tell what's an overhang and what's dangling moss, what's a thorny vine and what's set dressing. The music is fine. It's nothing special, but it fits the mood of the game and provides calming ambiance. The characters aren't the next Mario or Sonic, but they're designed reasonably well. Ori looks appropriately quick and nimble. The world looks like an illustration in a storybook, which matches the childlike nature of the plot. There are good production values here, but they're in service of an inherently flawed experience.

I knew, just by looking at it, that Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be the type of game players lose their minds over. It's pretty. It copies Hollow Knight. It tugs on the heartstrings in a Disney kind of way. But I think players are focusing on the flashy trimmings and ignoring the core game play. That core is rotten. There's too much wasted time, too many frustrating questions, and too many shortcuts taken by the developers who should have been crafting a thought-out, interconnected map. They prioritized the wrong elements and made something that is more ""vibes"" than substance.

The DEMO lagged on my MEDIUM END machine yet looked AMAZING.  So I MAY need a GPU upgrade :)

but, i am not my character. by virtue of this being a videogame and not an actual TTRPG scenario, i cannot pick any option in this game that would actually suit how anybody in my party would react to the situations presented in this game. nobody acts like sentient beings who have the possibility of having any internality. in fact, the game has so many ""quirky"" dialogue options that it just seems like all of the party actually hate each other and none of them want to be doing what they're doing, but the plot demands it, so they must.

the only thing i enjoyed in this mess of a game was the combat. but it is quite literally bog standard 5e combat, so it's very hard to truly fuck up.

Overall – Blasphemous is a haunting blend of tough combat, stunning pixel art, and deeply atmospheric world-building. Playing as the Penitent One, you explore the bleak land of Cvstodia, an environment overflowing with twisted religious imagery and beautifully crafted, unsettling detail. The gameplay leans into deliberate, Souls-like combat. Every swing feels weighty, every enemy demands attention, and bosses are memorable, punishing, and incredibly satisfying to overcome. You’ll die often, but each attempt teaches you something, making progress feel genuinely earned. The story is delivered through cryptic dialogue and environmental clues rather than straightforward exposition, giving the game a mysterious, poetic tone. It’s the kind of world that invites you to piece it together rather than giving you answers outright. If you enjoy challenging Metroidvanias with rich atmosphere and art that sticks with you, Blasphemous is absolutely worth playing. Highly Recommended.

Here's the most frustrating characteristic of each point:
- platform usually requires high precision, i.e. if you don't jump exactly at the border of a platform, you won't grab it but instead will fall through it;
- exploration doesn't give you clues about where to go next so, every time you beat a boss and complete an area, you either look on the Internet or have to go forth and back in every single part of the map, until you find a new area you can access (and, of course, being a souls-like, this not only takes time but it's also annoying because enemies keep re-spawning);
- all enemies deal damage just by contact, and with punishihng hit-boxes (like, being close to a still enemy is equivalent to getting smashed by a hammer).
  This is not only another source of frustration both while doing platform and exploration/navigation, but also results in added frustration while fighting, in having to calculate not to end up too close to an enemy after an attack, and sometimes in not having a single safe point in the screen, when it's full of enemies.

I hate those. They simply do not work properly.

I've played some horrible platforming sections in games prior, but this takes the cake, no the whole bakery.
Trying to grab unto ladders is 50/50 and trying to sword climb/hang is about 25/75.
It's just inconsistent and results in your death every time, which would be fine if it wasn't caused by poor mechanics.

I've played less than an hour and have already died to this about 20 times and not a single time to enemies

The arbitrary difficulty of this game just makes it plain not enjoyable. Most of the time it feels like you're dying because of the game design and the controls, rather than your own mistakes. 

I've also had a myriad of issues relating to controls with both controller and keyboard/mouse. Sometimes when you die playing with a controller, the game stops recognizing any buttons during the death screen, so you have to press a key on the keyboard and then all your inputs go back to KB/M. Even if you continue playing like that, since the game still recognizes the controller, it turns out the Dodge button doesn't work, which leads to yet another stupid death. You then decide to play with KB/M (spending some time in the control settings to remap things) and then think that you're good to go and enjoy the game when you pick up an item and realize you can't scroll the text in the item description, but you can with a controller.

* Attend culinary school
* Make life-changing choices
* And romantically pursue a bishonen anime version of Colonel Sanders, who has more abs than menu items.

Not a parody *of* KFC.
A parody dating sim **by** KFC.

---

### Pros

* 100% free, which is good, because you’ll need that money for actual chicken afterward.
* Genuinely gorgeous anime art. Everyone looks like they escaped from Ouran Host Club and fell into a deep fryer.
* You’re a culinary student at the “University of Cooking School: Academy for Learning,” which is the most legally safe fake school name ever written.
* Cast includes:

  * Hot Sanders
  * Your supportive bestie
  * Evil rivals Aeshleigh & Van Van the Man Man (yes that’s his name)
  * Professor Dog, who is an actual dog in a little chef’s hat
* There’s a secret ending, “secret recipes,” and dramatic “cooking battles” that feel like Iron Chef on a marketing budget.

---

### Cons

* Steam tags say things like “Souls-like,” “FPS,” and “World War I” because the community is unhinged. Please ignore them.
* Choices “have consequences,” but most of the time the real consequence is Colonel Sanders being slightly disappointed in you, which honestly hurts more than a game over.
* Actual dating content is pretty tame; it’s less “thirst sim” and more “branding exercise with sparkles.” Critics were… not impressed. Players, on the other hand, are just vibing.
* You *will* finish it and realize you just emotionally invested in a man whose primary character trait is “11 herbs and spices.”

---

### Peak Colonel Experience

* Trying to give a sincere answer in class and being out-performed by a literal cooking robot named Clank.
* Getting genuinely nervous about impressing Sanders with your mashed potatoes.
* Replaying scenes to optimize dialogue like: “If I pick the wrong line, will he *not* franchise with me?”
* Credits roll and you close the game… then immediately google if anyone has actually cosplayed this version of Sanders. (They have. Of course they have.)

When I first booted up I Love You, Colonel Sanders!, I expected something campy, absurd, maybe even weirdly charming. A branded dating sim starring a hot anime version of the KFC mascot? It’s a wild concept — and in theory, a great setup for a parody or tongue-in-cheek experience. Unfortunately, once the initial novelty wore off, I found myself stuck in a painfully shallow game that feels more like an extended advertisement than anything resembling meaningful entertainment.

Visually, the game does a decent job. The character art is polished, and the overall aesthetic embraces the overly dramatic tone of anime dating sims with enthusiasm. But once you get past the surface, there’s not much there. The writing leans heavily into absurdity, but rarely in a way that feels smart or subversive. Most of the jokes fall flat, relying on randomness or self-awareness without actually saying anything clever. It’s quirky for the sake of being quirky — and after ten minutes, the charm runs out.

Worse, the “dating sim” mechanics are practically nonexistent. There’s barely any player agency or branching narrative to speak of. Choices feel inconsequential, and the story rails you through a linear path with little room for exploration or interaction. You’re not really playing a game — you’re reading through a branded fever dream with a couple of flavorless choices tossed in to justify the format.

And let’s talk about tone. For a game so fixated on parody, it’s weirdly toothless. It doesn’t parody dating sims so much as copy their structure and coat it in fast-food references. There's no critique, no clever twist — just KFC product placement wrapped in anime tropes. The whole thing feels safe, corporate-approved, and strangely hollow, like someone tried to be ironic without really understanding the genre they’re riffing on.

I don’t mind games being silly or promotional, but they still need to respect the player’s time. I Love You, Colonel Sanders! is all concept and no follow-through. Once you get the joke — “Haha, it’s Colonel Sanders but hot!” — there’s nothing else to latch onto. No gameplay depth, no meaningful story, no emotional engagement. Just a long commercial disguised as a game.",False,3,0,1753755753

Someone praised the story but it was an incoherent pile of sentences. I sincerely can't remember anything about it, some androids fighting some robots and mandatory rebels wanted something too.

Fighting in general is fine but holy f boss fights are a hot mess.

About 7h played, just got to the village. I've taken my time to explore but I don't really have anything worthwile to show for it so there is no joy in that.
I don't like the fighting, it feels slow, awkward lock-on and camera movement and aiming with the pod is annoying.
The story seems very, very good based on the hints so far but you get so little of it and it's just so much running between places - like a FF game haha.

The hacking minigame seems broken? I could fire in the first one but after that I can't shoot (the pod shoots just fine outside of the hacking game so key-mappings are fine). Every time there is a hacking minigame I take damage instead and have to use a restore item. At least I assume you should shoot at that ball which shoots at you(?) because if I take 0 damage in that minigame I still take damage outside. Very confusing and annoying.

Don’t Starve surprised me with how well it blends whimsical art with grounded survival mechanics. The atmosphere is incredible, the survival loop is addictive, and the game still holds up after all these years. Combat is the weakest part, but everything else pulled me in. For the price, it’s absolutely worth it.

The Good:
• Amazing Tim Burton-style art and quirky tone
• Strong survival loop with great early-game pacing
• Realistic mechanics that actually matter (fire spreading, sanity, sleep)
• Weather, darkness, and nightfall create genuine tension
• Lots to discover and experiment with
• Time flies, easy to get absorbed

The Not-So-Good:
• Combat feels basic and predictable
• Early sanity confusion until you understand the system
• Building in a 2.5D space can feel a little awkward
• Requires trial-and-error before things start to really click

Final Verdict: 7.5/10

One of the better survival games out there if you like creepy whimsy and grounded mechanics. Combat needs work, but the atmosphere and loop are excellent.

Combat always feels like an uphill battle because it feels like no matter what strategy I try using, I'm doing something wrong and getting hit HARD by the enemies. This became tedious and annoying when exploring and going back the screen I was just on like 5 seconds ago just to find out that the enemies reapawned, and they're a pain to avoid! I've played so many JRPG type games but the combat system just wasn't clicking for me. 

I also just couldn't get into the humor or be bothered to care about the side characters. I dunno, maybe it's because I played Deltarune so much only a couple of months before this game and I intentionally and unfairly compare the 2 of them - of course this would seem dull in comparison to that game for me. 

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. The combat in concept is a really fun idea and the story seems interesting. Overall it was just too meh for me to want to continue. 

I would probably still recommend this game, but there's one really annoying flaw that I experienced while playing it that I can't forgive. The issue is simple yet big enough to have a negative impact on gameplay for multiple sections of the game - THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SO DANG DARK. I encountered a section where you're alone in a dark house, and I almost thought my system was frozen because I could barely see anything. This resulted in me fumbling around in the dark and extending that section of the game by like another half hour longer than it was supposed to take because I just couldn't see where to go. I tried everything I could think of involving messing with brightness, contrast, gamma, docking it to my TV, etc. It seems this is not an issue unique to me, because I found a couple of forums concerning the issue and none of their propsosed solutions worked. I guess this was the case for a couple of other people on the forums because they quit the game too since there are multiple dark sections of the game they didn't want to deal with lol. I just don't see how the devs haven't fixed something so glaringly obvious and annoying after all this time that the game has been released. I would've considered returning this and purchasing it on the Nintendo Switch but I already went over the 2 hour play time and couldn't return it so I didn't want to waste my money again 🙃

That's not what the game actually calls them, but it's what I'll call them. Each world has ""sequences"" to them. You cannot explore the entirety of the dream world before the real world, and vice versa. The first sequence of the dream world seemed decently engaging enough, where the rules that the game establishes for itself not being set in stone, and each interaction and fight feeling new and fresh. This maintains itself in the first sequence in the real world, where I was able to explore it and find all the connections between it and the dream world. And then after that...the rules have already been established, and the game doesn't particularly deviate from it, if at all. And those interesting parallels aren't really drawn anymore. So it's just a long, repetitive...well, I wouldn't say slog. But it isn't particularly enjoyable.
 Story wise...there is a twist that completely sours the story. A part of me doesn't want to reveal the twist, but then again, if you don't want to play a game again simply because you know the twist to it, what's the point of the game, really? In short, I can't sympathize with manslaughter. You, the character, have committed a criminal act. If not involuntary manslaughter, then staging it to look like a suicide certain doesn't help things, either. And THEN the main character and the character who helped you stage the body feel bad about it? They feel bad about losing a friend? Would it have killed them to, I don't know, call for help? Instead of staging it to look like a suicide? That's what a friend would do! Get their friend help! Now, I haven't actually reached the end. I've just seen enough spoilers through the community of this game to have found that out. And that twist just completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. Getting so attached to some characters in a movie, show, or video game just for it to not resolve in a fulfilling way...you know, closure...that's one of the greatest sins a piece of media can commit.

-This may fall under me disliking RPGs, but I really wish there was no/a higher limit on the number of saves you can have at once.
-Interacting with stuff is weird. Sometimes you need to press and hold, and sometimes it wont let you close out after a single tap.

Honestly this game is dying and it's killing me to admit it :

- Queing/Matchmaking will play with your nerves because of dodging and server errors. Today again I queued for 15 minutes to get a RM. 
- Servers and Codebase are pure trash, and I'm not even exagerating. Constants drops, players crashing (and stop saying it's because of potatoes PC, High end Configs crashes too). 
- You can't get back in a game after a crash, so it's instant GG. 
- Players crash is happening all the time. Looking at my history on insights, there's about 1 on 2 games that last between 1 and 5 minutes because of players dropping out of the game.

NEVER play without sound. The indie soundtrack is GOD tier. I get chills every time I listen to any of the songs either from this or the prequel.

Life is Strange,319630,0.0,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198969781032,"Before you read this review - if you're considering buying this game because you're looking for a good ""choices matter"" game with incredible time travel mechanics and attention to detail, and you haven't played Steins;Gate, definitely buy Steins;Gate instead, no questions asked. If you've already played Steins;Gate and you are looking for something that has some of the same types of themes, I guess this game kind of does... But be prepared to lower your expectations. A lot.

This game had a lot of potential and I was pretty intrigued after playing through the first episode... But then once I started playing the DLC episodes I realised pretty quickly that even though it constantly tells you ""your choices will influence the past, present, and future, choose wisely"", none of your choices actually have any real impact on the story. Whenever you encounter a choice that seems like it should have a significant impact, you can pretty much bet that whatever character is affected by the choice has already completed their role in the story by that point and won't really be mentioned much for the rest of the story (regardless of which option you picked).

One thing I did like about the game is the rewind mechanic. It is implemented really well, and there are quite a few good puzzles that make use of it. Unfortunately, this leads me into my next complaint, which is the abundance of bugs in the game that range from slightly inconvenient to pretty infuriating.

One of the most annoying bugs in this game is that the camera constantly locks up. I think it has something to do with ""examining"" something and then immediately trying to move the camera after closing the examine screen. It will lock your camera in a specific direction and make it impossible to look around for a while, and then after you walk around for long enough the camera will eventually fix itself (usually). And then there are a couple of sections where you can get locked in the rewind screen without any way of escape and you have to restart the section and go through everything again. Also something is glitched with the textures, it seems like the characters sometimes have multiple layers and one of the layers sometimes halfway glitches and they get super pale or something. Fortunately that one is pretty easy to ignore because the graphics are already bad enough that you don't really notice. Not that bad graphics really detracts from the overall experience, which is obviously a lot more narrative-driven than something that's meant to blow you away with visual fidelity.

Then there's the plot. The time travel stuff is pretty interesting and there are some genuinely clever ethical dilemmas that arise from it, but the setting really wasn't for me. Most of the characters are annoying (which makes sense I guess because they're all teenagers at a private school) and there's a lot of swearing for no good reason. And the main conflict is just weird, and doesn't seem realistic at all. Also, I grew up in Oregon and THERE AREN'T ANY FIREFLIES. I guess that's a nitpick, but that immediately broke what little immersion there was for me, lol

Anyway, I wouldn't recommend paying $20 for the DLC even if you played the first episode and enjoyed it. Your money is much better spent on something like Steins;Gate.",False,1,1,1762556626

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The game world can be quite spectacular to behold. Inquisition takes the foundation of DA1 and DA2 and expands it immensely. The locations you visit are varied, from ancient Elven forests to sandy deserts to stormy coasts, the locations are different enough to where the biomes don’t get repetitive and even have some throwbacks to DA1. Furthermore, the exploration and interaction are good. Each area has tons of collectables and lore entries that teach the player about the area and where it fits into the history of Thedas. 
Perhaps the big negative thing to point out here is quantity over quality. I would have preferred if there were actually [i]less[/i] zones with a greater emphasis on each zone being deeper and more meaningfully designed. Because while they are beautiful to behold and can be fun to explore, fatigue is very real and remembering the nuances of each area can be more difficult than it should be. 

The narrative is okay. It’s a typical “Big bad trying to destroy the world” type thing, but I think the setting and characters elevate the narrative to greater heights. 
As for the DLCs, Jaws of Hakkon is forgettable, The Decent is better, and Trespasser is probably the best bit of story content in the game, shame the best parts only last ~20 minutes. 

[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The mechanics are decent, but I feel that largely it is a step back in depth from DA1 and more inline with the gradual streamlining of DA2. The prior games had a unique take on Dungeons & Dragons, while DA:I feels much more shallow. It’s kind of like going from something like Final Fantasy X to FF XV - yes, it's prettier and faster and cooler, but the RPG mechanics suffer. Gone are any sort of stat-based conversation options, the character progression is simplified, and even abilities can feel very boring and shallow. The game does open up a bit when you unlock your classes' specialization, as some of those kits are fun and work very well with the base classes, but I still can’t help but feel an overall theme of having less RPG mechanics in an RPG game, which is a big negative for me. 
New to DA entirely (I think) is the crafting. This can help to customize your character's gear, especially if you don’t know where the best drops are or if you are simply unlucky. 

The difficulty is generally fairly easy, especially as you level up and unlock better gear and more talents. I played on Normal, and it was a tad difficult in the beginning, but by the time I unlocked my Knight Enchanter specialization after about ~12 hours, I was blowing things up.
One thing I did enjoy is the addition of “Trials” which are optional difficulty increases. You can choose to add elective difficulty increases for some small increased awards like additional loot. Things like having enemies level with you (which is how it naturally was in DA1/DA2) or even an option to turn bears into mini-boss gods. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The graphics are very PS4-era, and while they do age pretty well for a ~11 year old game, certain things like animations can be very stiff and reflections on metal surfaces appear just awful. Still, I think this is a great looking game for its age. 
Probably the worst area graphically is the menu UI. It definitely feels like the focus is on the console versions because the UI is just awful to use with a mouse and keyboard. You have to constantly do things like move your mouse off and then back onto an item to get the tooltip to display. 

On the technical side, the game is not good. I experienced multiple crash to desktops and many bugs when my game simply wouldn’t load, and I had to alt+F4 to the last save. Even aside from technical issues, I ran into gameplay bugs where my characters would stop using abilities, or I couldn’t pick up items on the ground. I had to reload often to fix them. I even ran into bugs where essential characters seemed to have fallen through the ground and was missing all their dialog, essentially ruining the quest.

[h1] [b] Audio – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
I found the audio to be good. The music is largely forgettable, but there were a few iconic songs that are great. 
Voice acting is top-notch and awesome. 
I did encounter many cases where the audio simply stopped working. From combat to dialog, no sound. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]
I think there is some decent replay value here - you can choose male or female, different races, different classes, and different romances as well as a few quests that have some slightly different outcomes. The game is pretty linear, but the choices can definitely warrant multiple runs. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Dragon Age Inquisition (DAI) is the THIRD game in the Dragon Age series. I highly recommend you go and play the first and second, as they have aged fairly well and are great experiences. Now that you’re here and thinking of diving into DAI what can you expect and how does it compare to DA1/DA2? 

DA1 has a very dark setting full of intrigue. It’s full of solid RPG gameplay that is parallel to Dungeons & Dragons. DAI does not largely have that. DA2 seemed like a step-down from many of the things that made DA1 so great, but it’s still a good RPG. I feel like DAI is on par with DA2 in that it's decent, but streamlined so much that player choice suffers. 

What DAI offers is a massive open world within the Dragon Age universe, like you’ve never seen it before. I want to make it clear that massive does not mean good. DAI has a clear problem of quantity over quality. You can easily burn dozens of hours doing fetch quests and other random pointless crap that serves no narrative purpose other than to increase your “Points” that you can then spend on unlocking more zones to do more pointless things that give more points…DAI is a nice 40-hour RPG adventure wrapped up in an 80-hour game. 

It’s not all bad, though. I would say the best part is the story. That 40 hour story is pretty good for about 20 of those hours. Especially the DLC, Trespasser. If Mass Effect’s sendoff was anything to go by, BioWare is very good at doing epilogues for their games and where it ends immediately makes you want more. Also, I have to do a shoutout to the great characters. It’s a pretty great cast of characters with their own personalities. Sera is my elfy wife. 

Overall, yes, I would recommend DAI. I think it's an okay game. Fans of DA1 and DA2 probably shouldn’t miss it. 

[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]
[h1]Yes[/h1]
$40 is steep for an 11 year old game. $10 sale price though is very good for the amount of content you get, and if you can get it for the historical low of $4, VERY worth.

[i](This review contains no story spoilers btw!!)[/i]

[b]-Overview-[/b]
Developed by BioWare, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a massive fantasy RPG that blends real-time combat with tactical strategy. Players take command of the Inquisition, leading a diverse group of companions to restore order to a fractured world. With hundreds of quests, beautiful environments, and meaningful choices, it delivers an epic adventure, but it is also heavily built on the foundations of the previous two Dragon Age games, and newcomers may feel they’ve missed major pieces of context.

[b]-Story & Characters-[/b]
[i]A strong, engaging story, best experienced after playing the first two games.[/i]
 Inquisition’s narrative is well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and packed with political drama, divine conflict, and moral decisions. However, the game relies heavily on world events, character arcs, and choices established in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II. Returning characters make cameos, past decisions impact present events, and major story threads continue directly from earlier titles.

For players who haven’t experienced the prior games, much of this depth risks feeling distant or incomplete. The Dragon Keep system, which lets you import or manually reconstruct past choices, helps fill the gaps mechanically,  but not emotionally. Reading about choices you never made or characters you never met is a poor substitute for having lived those stories yourself. This is one of the few RPGs where your personal history with the series genuinely matters, and missing that history can lessen the impact of major scenes.

As a first-time Dragon Age player, it’s easy to feel like you’re walking into the third act of a trilogy without having seen the first two. The story is still very good, but you’ll constantly sense that you’ve missed meaningful context, relationships, and payoffs. If anything: I wish someone had told me to play the first two games first. I would have enjoyed this story far more if I’d brought my own choices and experiences into it instead of relying on presets.

Companions are well-written and offer solid banter and personal quests. Their level of involvement is similar to Fallout 4: they’re memorable and distinct, but their presence has less influence on the core story than companions in Mass Effect or Dragon Age: Veilguard.

[b]-Gameplay-[/b]
[i]A complex combat system that becomes satisfying once mastered.[/i]
 Combat can be overwhelming early on, especially for players new to managing AI tactics and switching between party members. Over time, though, it becomes one of the game’s strengths. The mix of real-time action and tactical pausing allows for careful planning or fast-paced brawling, depending on your build. However, people who aren’t new to this type of combat system will find themselves bored with the lack of builds you can make with your character. Still, I found it to be quite enjoyable, regardless.

Character progression is exceptionally well-paced: you begin fragile and unsure, but grow steadily stronger through skill trees, specialization classes, and improved gear. You cannot brute-force enemies above your level, they will flatten you, but the game fairly challenges you within your tier.

Exploration is vast, and each region feels alive with wildlife, secrets, side quests, and collectibles. The sheer amount of optional content is impressive, though some zones can feel bloated with minor objectives.

[b]-World Design & Visuals-[/b]
[i]One of the most visually striking RPGs of its era.[/i]
 The landscapes are vibrant, diverse, and grounded in strong artistic direction. From snowy fortresses to lush jungles and windswept deserts, each region is detailed and atmospheric. The world feels alive and lived-in, and the lighting and environment design remain a standout even today.

[b]-Music & Sound-[/b]
[i]A solid soundtrack that shines in key moments.[/i]
 While the score is not consistently memorable on its own, it elevates major scenes beautifully. Music swells during emotional peaks and blends seamlessly into exploration. Voice acting is strong across the board.

[b]-Length & Value-[/b]
[i]A colossal RPG with well over 90 hours of content.[/i]
 Even a focused run takes dozens of hours, and completionists can expect significantly more,  especially with story DLC. At its frequent sale price, it’s excellent value. However, this isn’t necessarily a good thing, as by the end of the game, you start to get bored exploring all these different zones and doing all these different fetch quests, and at some point, you just wish for the game to end.

[b]-Replayability-[/b]
[i]Worth replaying only if you want to see major branching outcomes.[/i]
 The game offers multiple endings and many impactful choices, but each playthrough is a major time investment. Most players will likely complete it once and revisit it after a long break.

[b]-Summary-[/b]
Dragon Age: Inquisition is a richly developed RPG with excellent world-building, strong narrative arcs, and satisfying character progression. Its size can be overwhelming, but its story and environments are worth the time, provided you play the first two Dragon Age games first.

For newcomers, the Dragon Keep system cannot replicate the emotional weight of decisions you never made or relationships you never formed. The game is filled with callbacks, cameos, and payoffs designed for long-time fans, and much of that will be lost without experiencing the earlier titles.

[b]Highly recommended, especially after completing Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, which will greatly enhance the story and make Inquisition feel like the true saga finale it was designed to be. 9/10 game, not surprised it’s won game of the year before.[/b]",True,0,0,1763751839

Despite how good Dragon Age Origins was, no amount of nice lore and storyline helps me tolerate the obsessive amount of grinding in this game that does not know if it wants to provide a good single-player experience or to be an MMORPG with offline servers.

Dragon Age Inquisition is the product of a new design philosophy that spits on the memory of Dragon Age Origins by diverting the player from its previous narrative-driven and consequence-driven logic to an open-world design with vestigial elements from a logic of microtransactions in pay to win games.

Of course there are no microtransactions in Dragon Age Origins, but we all know that blocking quests behind real wait times (like in the war room) are only used by game developers to force players into paying to unlock these sections of the game faster. By blocking quests merely for the sake of it under hours or days, the developers brought a vestige from the microtransaction systems of P2W games, and this is not the only instance where Dragon Age Inquisition is more akin to an MMORPG than to a good single-player RPG.

But what is so wrong with this new design philosophy that Bioware has adapted? That it breaks the narrative of what Dragon Age is.
Dragon Age Inquisition is the story of a person who seems to have been touched by divine power, surviving an explosion with a mark that provides the key to bring the world back into order from beaches that allow demons to cross from the fade to Thedas. It is the story of a person who becomes the public face of an organization tasked with saving the world. It is a story of urgency, the breaches won't wait for the main character to have a field trip before they come to save the world.

Yet, the game design gets everything wrong:
1. Despite the narrative emphasis that Dragon Age has always exhibited, every actual plot moment seems to be blocked by hours of constant grinding and filler material.
2. Every combat has lost all its meaning and it's now nothing but filler. Every enemy is an HP piñata ready to waste your time even in the easiest difficulties. And not even in the sense of being difficult, just in the sense of being unnecessarily long.
3. The open-world zones destroy all sense of urgency and of pacing, letting the player roam to the most irrelevant places.
4. Most of the side quests are filler content that lack any connection to the player's status as the Herald of Andraste or even any relevance to their mission. Yeah, you can make people be more favorable to the Inquisition by helping them do menial things, but that is not the job for the person who is in charge of closing the breaches. The open-world design forces the player character into an errand-runner, but they are not an errand-runner. They are the Herald of Andraste!

Thus, all these are symptoms of a game design philosophy that does not suit the narrative of a Herald touched by almost divine power. The open world logic forces a dissonance where, despite the urgency of the situation and the role the main character plays in the great scheme of things, the player is invited to waste its time doing everything but the engaging with the main plot. Its vast open-world zones interrupts the pacing and drama, its excessive amount of filler combat distracts from the actual point of the story and its new system of side quests excessively reliant on letters (instead of actual interesting interactions with real people) does not add to the real plot. We've gone from a story-driven game to an open world with the vestiges of microtransaction logic bringing about a degree of dissonance that just destroys the entire experience. Going to a new place like Val Royeaux does not feel anymore like advancing the plot, but like just opening a new can of worms with more irrelevant chores to complete. This game may be great for grinders and completionists, but it does not feel at all like a continuation of Dragon Age Origins.

But this, is not that. This is just one tragedy right after another, almost all caused by a certain apparently incredibly racist demographic. That's the message, a certain demographic is evil and racist and this game attempts to show you first hand just how treacherous and cruel the world is for anyone outside of that demographic. So if you love  political messages being shoved down your throat, this is the game for you.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of the dialogue is unskippable, none of the characters are likable, all just victims of the racist and religious evil doers with their own uninteresting stories of how they're also victims. This results in being forced to sit through literally hours of boring dialogue from people you just do not care about in the slightest.

I'm gonna be honest, I've put this review off for quite some time but I feel like it's now or never because I want to put this game behind me and never engage with it again.

Just like with the other titles in the Life is Strange series, I bought this game on release. I've played it on both PlayStation and PC as well as watched content creators, YouTubers, streamers and friends play through the game. I'm sure I've squeezed every bit of content I can out of this game and explored most if not all options. My tldr; it's the worst thing that's happened to the Life is Strange franchise.

To those that know me, it's no secret that I genuinely despise this game. I hate the fact that they took such a beautiful story concept that was Life is Strange (2015) and decided to turn it into a political issue and add forced religion as the cherry on top. 

Don't get me wrong, I think these are very important issues that definitely needs to be addressed, I just hate that they used Life is Strange as the platform to do it. 

Going into this game completely blind, besides seeing teasers and trailers and what the developers had shown us online previously to playing it, I was genuinely interested. I thought it was going to be an emotional journey with intriguing characters to meet along the way just like previous games but was quickly severely disappointed. 

I think my absolute biggest grudge with this game has to be Daniel. I'm not joking when I say I would put him among some of the worst, most annoying characters I have ever seen in any video game. Worse than Ashley Graham - Resident Evil 4 (2005). Worse than Navi - Legend of Zelda. Worse than Paimon - Genshin Impact. 

Not even one hour into the game and I already wanted to leave this runt in the middle of the forest to starve by himself. The dialogue, his actions, his thinking-it was all like nails on chalkboard and I couldn't stand him. The constant lying, betrayal towards his own brother, the god complex he portrayed because of his powers and his need to put others down made me have to unwillingly battle through any content throughout this game that had Daniel involved.

""But he is a child, they make stupid decisions!"" I hear-yet whenever we see other children throughout the franchise they're not HALF as ignorant or dumb as Daniel is. 

""He lost his father, he is dealing with trauma!"" Loss is a massive part of this franchise and it doesn't justify ANY of his poor thinking or unjustified actions throughout the game.

I've seen the praise that brothers Diaz get from others that love this game and I'm happy they have characters they're so fond of, I've accepted the fact that I don't like Daniel and I never will.

The other characters you meet along the way are ""okay""? I guess.. Some of them stick out more than others and you have short moments where you get to explore them more and learn more about their story and their life and it's honestly the part of this game that I enjoyed the most. Sitting by a campfire together, drinking beer and sharing stories of past trauma or exciting events was moments where I felt the most engaged with this game. I think it's this games strongest asset but also where they missed a core opportunity for great writing. There are moments where you meet characters who are intriguing and who have genuine care for you and your brother and who offer well needed help in time of need. Only for the game to throw these characters away never to be seen again. Shout-out Brody. You won't be forgotten.

My second grudge with this game was the ENTIRE CHAPTER focused on a religious cult. 

It's like they asked each other in the office previous to making this game and brainstorming how they could make Daniel even MORE unbearable. By slapping a religious sticker on his forehead and FORCING the played to interact with it. The entire chapter as a whole felt like a chore, your saving grace is meeting your long lost mother Karen (Voiced by the amazing Jolene Andersen, aka. Ada Wong - Resident Evil) and trying to patch up their broken relationship. Yet nothing felt more justified than setting the cult's home ablaze and leaving this horrendous chapter to burn to ash (literally).

So was there any parts to the game that I actually enjoyed? Yes. Of course there was. I give credit where credit is due. Being on the run and seeking help from long lost family or strangers gave a feeling of unease and caution but also a sense of warmth and trust at the same time. Bonding with the introduced characters was great, along with music that's iconic for Life is Strange games, though I felt a slight step down from previous titles, still great tunes to get lost in.

Something I will give this game praise for is it felt like they finally landed that sweet spot where puzzles felt natural. Something I gave previous titles some bad score for because of it's misuse of puzzles, I was glad to see LiS 2 finally managed to get it right. 

In conclusion I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they are looking to complete every title in the series, I feel like this game can easily be avoided or watched online. I wouldn't suggest someone to buy this game even on sale, though definitely pick it up for free or play it if it was gifted to you. I'm sure there are many others who will love this game and give it praise that it's known for.

Minor bugs were present though nothing near other titles. I was happy to see that.

All in all it's another addition to the LiS franchise and another episodic, decision based story game to get lost in for anyone looking for games matching this criteria.",False,2,0,1761503418

An abundance of idiotic one-hit-kill mechanics coupled with limitations to saving that lead to having to do boring shit over and over again (a couple of the fights are really unreasonable to boot), the lack of any (!) character development, the worst/most uninteresting loot/equipment system I've ever seen (and with the spectre weapons you can get before the halfway point being the best in the game, all further weapon looting is pointless – and so are the millions of accumulating credits you can't spend on anything because there is nothing worth buying! this isn't even amateur level game design, it's retard level!), boring-as-fuck levelling which is completely unbalanced as well, psionic abilities all seem to do the same thing (namely, hindering your opponent for a few seconds – I can't tell a difference between them at all!), the abominable balance of main and side quests (speedrunners must love this though...), unskippable cutscenes, many, many bugs... and, most direly, the total and utter failure in the RPG aspect as you cannot choose even your own words (!), much less anything else between generally good and vaguely evil... and it's beyond reason itself, as predecessor Knights of the Old Republic was infinitely better in each and every single regard, and DA:O which came afterwards in almost all regards!

EDIT: Game 2. Oh boy! There is more character development in the first 30 min than in game 1, but the actual gameplay is so much worse I simply cannot believe it! Only 4 to 6 things to level instead of some 15 (!), you can't specialise in weapons, the actual shooting feels way worse, the first (!) group battle is already next to unwinnable (and I did beat game 1 on hardest difficulty...), health refills are gone apparently (or I cannot find them) and to top things off, I cannot figure out how to fucking map the quickslots (which I never used in the first game, as I was able to map the weapons to keys, WHICH SHOULD ALSO BE THE CASE HERE!). Fucking shit, the sniper scope doesn't even line up with your line of sight, LOLOOLOL.

I cannot believe how hard they fucked up the gameplay compared to the already not very good first game! No inventory at all, four or five skills to level, no specialisation in weapons, still no feedback whatsoever – you are literally not told whether you hit an enemy or not, and what hits you in turn (even though the latter isn't as important as you can't protect yourself against different kinds of damage, OBVIOUSLY)! No way to boost your abilities in something like the insane garage fight (complete with the biggest video game sin that exists, infinitely respawning enemies – and that's against very limited ammo!!! Hell, after this shit I'll never complain about a game having infinite ammo again!), hell, the fuckers even took out health potions altogether!!! There's apparently quickslots but no apparent way to map them, so I have to change my weapon FROM THE FUCKING MENU EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Oh and making the sprint key not only the same as Use but also Cover in this one means I will never buy another game from this developer again.

I regret spending 4,79 on this fucking shit of a game, I really do. They did not test this game before releasing it, and they did not test the re-release either... what kind of people would do that... only the worst scum imaginable. Humanity doesn't DESERVE to be saved!",False,0,2,1763510572

With that out of the way, honestly to me the Trilogy's narrative doesn't hold up at all. 

The first game is great and establishes the world and a solid vibe game. The only complaint I have is that the companions are a bit vapid, but the game still rocks. 

The second game sidelines the entire first game and elements established within. The first game established the Trilogy's main antagonist, how much of a threat they're going to be, and how the galaxy needs to start preparing now. What's the second game about? Oh human colonies are going missing and a human terrorist organization is using Shepard to investigate them. At least that would be the plot if the main meat of the game wasn't spent on making sure your companions' family troubles aren't resolved. The focus on the small bunch of characters takes away from the greater universe and the impending doom that will need to be resolved in the third game. 

Imma be honest, I've played Mass Effect 3 before and trying to play it after 1 and 2 is a huge tone shift that makes the game feel like it's not a Mass Effect game. Unfortunately 2 set up 3 in a bad spot and it shows from the start. ""Oh no, the doomsday threat we were warned about in the first game is here! You know, that giant ship that basically required a whole fleet to take one down is now here in mass! What will we do?!"" Then Liara shows up with the blue prints for the Deus Ex Machina device and a point system that will determine if Shepards lives or dies in the either the Mountain Dew ending, the Mountain Dew Code Red ending, or in the Mountain Dew Voltage ending. But along the way, you get to rush by and resolve everyone else's problems because they wouldn't let you do so in the 2nd game due to babysitting duty.

ME1 - Fun third person RPG Shooter with depth for the story and gameplay Completed on Insanity nearly 100%.

ME2 - Awkward arcade hide and peek shooter that continues the story from ME1. It is a significant downgrade gameplay wise. Working on first play through on Insanity, but it simply is a worse game than ME1.

Long story less long:

ME 1: This is one of the best shooter RPG games I have ever played. Even though the graphics may be dated, the story is worth playing with good gameplay to back it up. The attention to detail in the world interactions rivals and beats games released in 2025. 

From social interactions that have implications later in the story, to physical interactions with the world, ME1 feels like a full game worth playing.

I would recommend giving it a try if this is on your backlog.

ME2: It is alright - very similar to ME1, but there are differences. The gameplay is such a let down after ME1, it feels like some exec who didn't even play the first game made some changes on how the fundamentals work by stripping a lot of the core gameplay from the game:

1.  There is no inventory system & you cannot swap weapons/armor during a mission.
2. They managed to make the maps & navigation worse and less useful in ME2. Can't even access the ground map during a mission. ME1 you could access it and place a custom marker at any time.
3. Weapon selection is limited and upgrading weapons is completely different.
4. They took the ability to crouch out of the game. This SIGNIFICANTLY limits how you can play the game compared to ME1.

 In order to crouch, you have to be directly in front of cover and it is not a true crouch, more of a duck and cover.  

Example why this is bad: I am standing, but the wall in front of me across some cross fire, could protect me if I could just MANUALLY CROUCH to hide from the enemy. In order to crouch, I have to go through cross fire that is currently blocked by a wall that will not provide protection if I crouch against it...but it is protecting me against the crossfire.

UnFun fact: You cannot crouch against every wall, anyways.

5. Sprint, Take Cover, Action/use are all mapped to same button.
6. You auto heal outside of combat, you do not use medi-packs to heal anymore.
7. They changed how weapons work in the universe, slightly. No longer do you have enough energy to run your weapon over the time the story takes place, but you now have depletable ammo. Ammo replaces the cooldown mechanic. 

This puts organics another step back from [spoiler]the Reapers[/spoiler] technology wise.

It was fun sneaking around in ME1, slowly moving around corners and peeking for shots. I hope manual crouch is brought back in future games...

I can see why people do not like Mass Effect 2. It is a stripped down version of ME1, with better graphics. The ""it does not feel like as much of an RPG as ME1"" comments are warranted. It doesn't.

7. Also, they made bypassing circuitry just... a hidden puzzle matching game...

You need to download EA's app to play the game at all, and if you don't make an account and log in then it will pop up every time you boot your PC up pestering you about it (even when you haven't loaded up Steam yet, never mind tried to play the game). There's no workaround for this, far as I can tell... and I did look.

I've only touched ME1 and I've had problems with the game progression. There's barely any tutorial, I keep having to look up how to do basic things like holster weapons and heal. Load times are meh, graphics are worse than I expected for a modern remaster, but that's fine, I can forgive that.

But the BUGS. My god. I was prompted to write this review by the fact that I just barely got past the ""prologue"" section of the game and immediately hit a game-breaking bug (cannot access the galaxy map, and therefore can't... do much of anything, I'm stuck on the Citadel).

I'll try reloading an old save and give those cutscenes another run-through, but this really doesn't bode well for the game overall. And I'm not eager for the experience of playing a game constantly worried that I'll be softlocked behind some random bug which makes my save unplayable.

The game itself, in terms of story and gameplay and so on, seems like something I could've been very into if I'd played when I was 14 but I can't say it feels especially engaging to me now.

I can’t avoid the fact I fundamentally don’t enjoy zombie settings. I thought Telltale’s Walking Dead would be the game to finally turn me around - after all, it’s rated so highly that it seemed superficial to me to write it off so easily. I love the episodic narrative-based format, and I especially love a tear-jerker. See my adoration of Life is Strange.

My problem with zombies is the fact they’re [b] such a boring [/b]enemy. By their very nature, they have near zero intellectual power, making them the most mentally unchallenging enemy to fight. The best villains build tension by outwitting the main character. But Zombies are entirely predictable. They have no personality or character traits, they can’t give any dialogue or communicate in interesting ways. They’re just spammed ad infinitum and thrown at survivors.

But zombies aren’t considered the real enemy of the zombie genre. Instead, it’s people’s inability to work together which ultimately leads to their deaths. But this means pedantic infighting, petty drama and miscommunication take centre stage, which is incredibly frustrating to endure. It’s like when you watch a horror film where each character leads themselves to their deaths due to their inability to communicate. 

The Walking Dead is centred around both of these cliches, and while I won’t argue it introduces a few other ideas too, it ultimately revolves around petty arguments between the majority of the characters. I know there’s some fondness for the art style too, but character’s faces are so comically exaggerated that it feels like a kid’s cartoon at times. The cell-shading doesn’t feel like a choice motivated by a strong artistic identity, but rather a practicality of a low budget. The game’s story themes are dark, dreary and depressing, so this Borderlands-esque look works at odds to this.

The puzzles feel less about figuring out the problem, but instead talking to characters and engaging with items in a prescribed order for it to eventually trigger your character carrying out the solution. I do appreciate some of the decision-making, and I genuinely like Lee and Clementine, it’s bogged down by the petty and childish supporting cast. Also, the game’s climax is ruined the moment you open the game because of the Steam community integration. This means under the “Play game” button you see scores of memes and artwork relating to the game’s final moments, ruining the emotional impact completely.

I won’t argue this review is unfair, since I don’t enjoy the fundamentals of the zombie genre, but I did think The Walking Dead might be so good as to make me overlook this. Sadly, this wasn’t the case.",False,2,0,1756577653

[i]SOMA[/i] is a first person horror game with clever philosophical depth and profoundness. This is achieved with a few trivial yet somehow awfully meaningful choices along a gripping journey through a bleak underwater research facility. Splendidly voice-acted protagonist Simon ([b]Jared Zeus[/b]) and his acquaintance Catherine ([b]Nell Mooney[/b]) provide their own opinions but leave room for the player to think.

SOMA's weakness is the lack of gameplay mechanics: it is a walking simulator with slight puzzle and stealth elements. Replayability is almost nonexistent due to that. But for one playthrough, the game does provide an immensely immersive 10-hour experience. The physical interactivity of objects -- pushing and pulling doors, grabbing and throwing stuff -- makes the game world feel tangible.

Certain sections with a monster can become frustrating if you get stuck on repeating them. Fortunately, in a post-release update, [b]Frictional Games[/b] added a Safe Mode option that stops the monsters from hindering your progress. The mode does reduce tension considerably -- since no actual threats -- but doesn't affect the overall gloomy atmosphere that much.",True,1,0,1764071698

There's enough quiet time to ponder these themes in between the monster encounters, most of which I found genuinely scary. The challenge of the game is basically to keep your nerve and figure out the monster's behaviour - short puzzles under emotional pressure. I think you'll be missing out if you use safe mode. 

There are also several more relaxed puzzles without any monster stalking you, which I found interesting and well-judged in terms of difficulty. I felt like I really could be the protagonist, trying this and that until something works. I also really appreciated that the game felt like a real environment, with lots of spaces and objects that aren't relevant to the player. I find this adds a lot to immersion. Furthermore, there are no stupid easter eggs or steam achievements for exploring every inch of the map. You can actually behave like you would if you were really in this world, instead of running around like a maniac looking for dopamine.
 
The story is excellent and very original. Not only that, I'd call it anti-formulaic.

After pushing through several hours, I’ve had enough. SOMA pretends to be this deep, atmospheric horror masterpiece, but in reality, it’s a painfully slow walking simulator with frustrating underwater segments. I’ve played my fair share of complex, puzzle-heavy survival horror games, and this one isn’t challenging, it’s just poorly executed and painfully repetitive gameplay.

The first hour hooked me with its atmosphere and story potential, but once you’re thrown underwater, the experience falls apart. Low visibility, sluggish movement, and maze-like areas where you wander aimlessly for hours with no sense of direction; not fun, not scary, just exhausting.

It’s a shame, because there’s clearly a good story buried somewhere under all this frustration. But good narrative design doesn’t excuse bad gameplay. I’ve played walking sims before, this one just happens to be the most boring one pretending to be more than it is.

Waiting for an elevator to go down, waiting for a vehicle to reach the destination, waiting for the game to load, wait for the audio log you triggered to finish because the game doesn't let you walk around while listening to them like every other game did since system shock 1 in 1994, waiting for a globule of doom to decide to finally hobble away, waiting for your character to crawl along an endless passage, wait for the character to incredibly slowly climb up a ladder (game fails the ladder rule), waiting for the endless expanse of ocean to finally lead to the next story module. The game should be like 4 hours but it's 10.

A horror game shouldn't have me intentionally running at 200mph towards the enemies you are supposed to avoid because i am tired of spending 30 minutes creeping around to avoid them when i can simply be punched in the face by them and get knocked out at which they automatically leave to a different part of the map.

There are sections of the game where the game tells you to do something but that something gets you killed anyway ""follow the lights"" if you follow the lights the monsters still kill you anyway and you have no way of hiding from them properly in that section so you just repeatedly get attacked anyway, so pointless.

Also, the concept of not being able to fight an enemy is unrealistic. A human can stab literally anything with an improvised spear and with enough conviction they will kill it. Welcome to being human we've been doing this since we lived in caves. (Yeah I don't care if the MC is technically only partially human in this game you know what I mean)

In short this is a walking simulator with like 5 puzzles in 10 hours. The story is good but the game is not. Also, the ending of the story sort of lives and dies on the idea of a programmer not understanding cut vs copy which I think would be the simplest of concepts for someone designing robots that contain human consciousness to understand.

DEVOUR plunges players into a frantic co-op horror experience where teamwork, panic, and quick thinking are the only things standing between your group and a terrifying cult entity. Each map feels like a self-contained nightmare, requiring coordination and courage as the tension escalates with every ritual item you collect.

The game shines in its simple yet effective co-op design. Working together to find items, manage resources, and dodge the ever-growing aggression of the possessed leader turns every match into a chaotic thrill ride. Communication is key—splitting up can mean faster progress, but also guarantees hilariously horrifying moments as someone gets dragged into the dark.

Atmosphere and pacing are major strengths. Each location—from haunted farmhouses to burning asylums—offers distinct threats, secrets, and environmental storytelling. The sound design ramps up fear at all the right moments, building suspense as the demon’s behavior evolves and the stakes rise.

Progression and replayability keep players coming back. Difficulty settings, unlockable cosmetics, and new maps with unique mechanics ensure that each run stays fresh. The unpredictability of enemy behavior and the frantic scramble near the end of each round make DEVOUR consistently exciting with friends.

Final Verdict:
DEVOUR is a fast, frightening, and wildly entertaining co-op horror experience. Its escalating tension, distinct maps, and teamwork-focused gameplay make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer scares and chaos-filled sessions with friends.

**DEVOUR – Review**

Pretty good horror game honestly. It looks simple at first but once the demon girl starts running at you full speed, bro your heart just drops. Playing with friends is hilarious and scary at the same time. It does get a bit repetitive sometimes, but it still keeps you on edge.

For the price, totally worth it. I screamed way more than I wanna admit. 8/10

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198052380519,"This is one of those games where the first 20 hours or so are very addicting as you learn to swim in an ocean of content and struggle with balancing your economy with logistics and raids; but once you understand how to swim in the ocean, the mechanics all feel really flat and repetitive. Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.

The good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.

Visually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.

My gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.

The combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.

As many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.

Overall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",False,2,0,1764008930

Starting a next run you're gonna be doing the same limited set of actions you can do to build your city. I have exhausted all variation quite shortly. I feel claustrophobic and lonely, it feels like im playing an empty husk of a world. Let me explain several independent thoughts I have which I'm conflicted about. These are only a few examples to explain a small portion of my feels.

Several mechanics and rules just live in the wild online as myths and mysticisms: what for, and how to use the wagon shop for example. Of course that's not the only one, as there are several other ones that are just not declared by the game so you kinda have to guess and hope it works like you want. Reading reddit comments and forum posts of other people's thoughts on what they believe the mechanic works like. There are several annoyances in the game that keep piling up at the back of your mind as you build your city and you get to know the systems of the game. Some examples:

The upgrade and proximity system encourages you to just cramp things together and make grids. It often comes down to ""do you want a pretty town, or do you want to survive?""
We want a pretty town of course, thats the game's appeal. But in the back of your mind this annoyance is always going to be there.

It's great that you can set a max limit for resources, so that villagers can quit that job and enter an other one. But this isn't true for all jobs: farmers, healers, soldiers are assigned to their duties and are still busy standing in their job title. There is no downside to unassigning them while they are not useful. You can also just let them be, which is what I do: but it's still going to be an annoyance in the back of your mind.

The reason for my dislike isn't concretely these 2-3 examples. It's the overall feel, for which I have provided these examples. This feel, while the game is in early access is fine, but not as a full release at full price: Which is how I encountered this game the first time. I gave it enough playtime for me to doubt myself, because I did have doubts, maybe I just didn't understand the vision or the game.

My ultimate verdict, as of 1.00, is go play songs of syx if you want a challenging city builder.  If you want a cozy city builder, this game is for you on the lowest difficulty.

I say this as someone who plays on vanquisher.

The game is fundamentally flawed on what makes a city builder engaging for those looking for difficulty/challenge 


Logistically this game is extremely lacking in complexity, even though on the surface it may not appear so.  Villagers are completely incapable of handling distances, despite the existence of wagons.  

There is no simple button of ""only allowed wagons to transport"" a resource.  Villagers will walk half way across the map to a node, to grab 2 ore, instead of waiting for a wagon to deliver.

You can get gamey with it to try and force it, but to me a city builder has failed on a basic level when you are unable to set such simple limits.

Second, the tech tree suffers from the same problem.  It may appear to offer depth complexity, but that is far from the truth.  Technology mostly exists to speed bump your city and its expansion by locking previous buildings behind tech.

There are glimmers of interesting ideas in the tree, active policies that trade benefirs for penalties; but they are mostly ineffectual or extremely strong to the point where the downside might as well not exist.

I could say more, especially the shallow nature of the military, but overall this game leaves me disappointed.",False,4,0,1763397736

The game isnt bad. It just lacks this organic feel to the creation of a village/city.
You could expect that you would be able to build something like in the artwork, but no.
You will end up creating mostly very straight roads, with roads following a rigid geometry. I would have love something more organic, more natural ( Manor Lords does this better).
The management is okay, i only found the combat really clumsy where you go back to the first age of empires, select everything and attack...
Not a bad game, not a great game just okay... is it enough for you? You decide !",False,1,0,1763316738

This one sits at the top of my list as favourite multiplayer shooter and for good reason.

The previous Insurgency still stands on it's own as a decent tactical shooter due to it's unforgiving 'realist-ish' game-play. But Sandstorm really does improve on it's predecessor in every way. From the selection of weapons and how they feel, to the game-play mechanics that have been given a little bit more attention to detail. Even the maps, new and old are a big improvement, with a hell of a lot more intractable environments and features. On top of all that, it's co-op feature makes it a blast to play with mates while taking down AI controlled enemy.

The last Insurgency was a massive step forward from it's humble CS mod beginnings. It has a simplicity that mixes well with its difficulty. Sandstorm is a great step up in attention to detail while not becoming too complicated. Well worth the price, especially if you are sick of 'bullet sponge' FPS.Jun 9, 202500Only visible to youmathieudbrtNot RecommendedQuit7Apr 15, 202500Only visible to youTristoonRecommended8LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Apr 1, 202500Only visible to youEvil_DipRecommendedBeat7Mar 31, 202500Only visible to youRufusRafusRecommended9Mar 29, 202500Only visible to youmohammed_hameed44RecommendedBeat7Feb 28, 202500Only visible to youRoyalpgytpcRecommendedBeat9LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Feb 25, 202500Only visible to youFrost_0352RecommendedPaused9Jan 9, 202500Only visible to youF4LLENH0NORGUARDRecommendedPlaying9LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityCo-opMore...Jan 3, 202500Only visible to youDoggedTapestryRecommendedBeat7Dec 23, 202400Only visible to youLTG2021RecommendedPlaying9LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Dec 10, 202400","PopularScore - HighScore - LowNoneHas TextRecommendedNot RecommendedOnly visible to youSebass21RecommendedBeat810d ago00Only visible to youSimon420RecommendedBeat8Oct 31, 202500Only visible to youCivilisERecommendedBeat7Oct 20, 202500Only visible to youM_singhRecommendedBeat10LIKED & DISLIKEDImmersionGraphicsOct 14, 202500Only visible to youAlexsandro FischerRecommendedBeat8Parapappapapa.

Gameplay
 This game has one of the most thrilling and addictive gameplays ever and though it might look crazy at first, once you get used to its pace and know the dynamics between weapons it just becomes hypnotic.
History
 This game has a simple history but it works for a game like this and even if it's optional with secrets the lore is interesting.
 Graphics
Retro and with good customization, you can make it look straight from the ps1 but you can also simplify the color palette to help you keep up with the speed of the game. The game changes ambient through its levels and manages to never feel monotonous.
 Sound
An awesome OST that fits brilliantly and despite the game being so extreme its variety doesn't disappoint.
Sound is spectacular, everything feels and sounds as powerful as it should be.
 
If you like FPS this is a must-play.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Oct 3, 202310Only visible to youCoredaiRecommendedBeat10This is single handedly the greatest game i have ever played, EVER. The gameplay is amazing, there is not a single dull moment in this game.

Flaws, first, is the pacing in the first act, specifically limbo. (you know, you know) You start feeling like an unstoppable force of nature and then all of a sudden you are hit into YOU, at which is limited by your moveset, at least. Cons, its limited by your moveset. However, thats one nitpick i'd say.

The bossfights are amazing, specifically the final fights in act i and ii. I wont discuss the secret bossfights, but they are unbelievably fun as well. Fighting the boss is surreal, and it really makes you feel like an anime protagonist. The pacing of this game is very fast, although that isn't really a bad thing, and the game isn't even complete yet, so i won't judge it on that.

The greatest praise i can give to this game is that if you ask ""can i do this?"", the answer is yes, no matter what. That's what makes this game so replayable.

The secrets are also ****ing amazing, like oh my god they are either hilarious or terrifying (again, if you know you know).LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCombatMore...Sep 26, 202310Only visible to youBlurayRecommendedPlaying10Extremely well balanced, no matter your skill level (I **** at video games, and this game is VERY accessible, but is much more difficult at higher, optional difficulty levels). The ""Cyber Grind"" mode is good for training yourself to be more responsive, while being oddly calming if you aren't specifically trying to beat your PB. The weapons are very fun to use, movement is fluid and overall it's one of the best games you can buy. Please play this game.

(The only real gripe I have is that the demo, which is supposed to show you if you'd like it, locks easy modes behind the full game, but chances are, if you like movement shooters, no matter how good you are at them, you will LOVE this game.)LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityDifficultyMore...Sep 13, 202310Only visible to youRevanTCORecommended9The amount of heart and charisma this game has is indescribable.

Gameplay
 This game has one of the most thrilling and addictive gameplays ever and though it might look crazy at first, once you get used to its pace and know the dynamics between weapons it just becomes hypnotic.
History
 This game has a simple history but it works for a game like this and even if it's optional with secrets the lore is interesting.
 Graphics
Retro and with good customization, you can make it look straight from the ps1 but you can also simplify the color palette to help you keep up with the speed of the game. The game changes ambient through its levels and manages to never feel monotonous.
 Sound
An awesome OST that fits brilliantly and despite the game being so extreme its variety doesn't disappoint.
Sound is spectacular, everything feels and sounds as powerful as it should be.

Sandfall really cooked here.  

This is one of those games that hits every single note with confidence. The art direction is jaw-dropping, with environments and character designs that feel literally ripped from a dream. 

The world is surreal and spooky and goofy in the best way, reminded me a lot of some of the GOAT’s like FFX. 

The combat stylish, engaging, and satisfying. It captures the spirit of turn-based JRPGs but layers in just enough action and strategy to feel super fresh. 

Every encounter feels meaningful, and there’s a rhythm to battles that keeps you locked in.

Now for the story. No spoilers, but it’s the kind of narrative that stays with you. Tragic for sure, and actually made me tear up a couple of times. 

This one’s going on my top 5 of all time. Not sure where it lands yet, but it’s in there. Expedition 33 reminded me over and over again why I love these type of games.

Masterpiece.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...May 10, 202570Only visible to youEndmostRecommendedBeat10It is rare to find games so highly charged with artistic ambition as this.

I could not stop recording while I played this game. Every character was well written, every environment was masterfully created, and the music provide*****most religious experience.

Expedition 33 is a story about loss and adventure for a brighter future. The game wouldn’t have gone far if it only offered a linear, black-and-white story - and it doesn’t. The impact of losing loved ones is more than many people can manage, and this shows on many levels in the characters of this game, both expected and unexpected.

I intentionally leave out any story details, even the early ones, since I think this is best experienced if you go in blind. I will say that I enjoy the occasional change of pace in the writing, which switches from heavy themes to humorous breaks, all very well executed.

The voice actors and performances are excellent, and studio’s resource limitations compared to a triple A production don’t show in any material way.

The game is a turn-based RPG. I thought I hated turn-based RPGs. I loved this game. The art direction was enough to get me through the initial leap of faith of trying out a genre whose gameplay I thought I disliked. The gameplay ended up being just as fun as the rest of the experience, especially when many battles are so tightly connected and so uniquely presented alongside key story arcs and climaxes. 

Alice Duport-Percier’s vocal performance throughout the game’s OST is breathtaking. It is no overstatement to say that the game wouldn’t be half of what it is if it weren’t for this masterful soundtrack. The breadth of emotions that the various tracks evoke is wide and resonant.

The visuals, art style, aesthetic and story are sublime. It evokes the feelings of a powerful, moving and epic RPG that I felt the first time I played through Final Fantasy 7, and it feels like what a modern day final fantasy would be like if they’d continued along the lines of the great final fantasy games like 7, 9 and 10.

The story is innovative, powerful, moving, and well-paced, with great pacing and reveals of its twists and turns and set in a beautifully well-realised world.

The combat itself is also worth acknowledging. It’s turn based but with some button prompts for action during the actions each turn (though these can be turned off if they feel too QTE), which adds the perfect balance, and the overall min maxing of builds is superb, with all the playable characters having their own unique combat mechanics.

The visuals, art style, aesthetic and story are sublime. It evokes the feelings of a powerful, moving and epic RPG that I felt the first time I played through Final Fantasy 7, and it feels like what a modern day final fantasy would be like if they’d continued along the lines of the great final fantasy games like 7, 9 and 10.

The story is innovative, powerful, moving, and well-paced, with great pacing and reveals of its twists and turns and set in a beautifully well-realised world.

The combat itself is also worth acknowledging. It’s turn based but with some button prompts for action during the actions each turn (though these can be turned off if they feel too QTE), which adds the perfect balance, and the overall min maxing of builds is superb, with all the playable characters having their own unique combat mechanics.

I just can’t rate this game highly enough, puts the AAA guys to shameLIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...May 16, 202530Only visible to yourosqvistareNot RecommendedQuit6Fun combat, but no minimap or guidence made me quit.LIKED & DISLIKEDCombatTraversalMay 11, 202535Only visible to youminituneRecommendedBeat10Absolute banger, pinnacle of fantasy stories. music makes you forget about reality and just keeps you immersed and on top of that a revolutionary turn based combat.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 9, 202530Only visible to youDrTrigerrrRecommendedBeat10Be prepared it's a challenging game

It is one of the many zombie survival games out there but for unknown reasons, this game feels different and superior to all of them.


The crafting system is well thought of. You can make a sh!t ton of items in this game, each with their own purpose. 

But by far the best aspect of the game for me, is the sound and music. The music is, like I said, atmospheric and reacts to the situation you are in. It is nice and peaceful during the day and gets gloomy and dark when the apocalypse is coming. 

The sound effects of the tools, weapons and zombies are one of the best I ever heard in a game, I am not joking. The sound you get when firing a blunderbuss or shotgun is simply amazing. The sound design in 7 Days to Die is something I really miss in a lot of other games. I just want to hear and feel the impact of your guns or tools when you do something, and this game does just that. 10/10.

7 Days to Die is still in Alpha Early Access and has been since freaking 2013! It is updated regularly but personally I think it is time to switch to Beta or to release it fully. But because of the Early Access, the price for this game is incredibly fair and I must admit that I did not encounter that many bugs or problems.

One complaint I have with this game is that, since the Alpha 19 was released, the game has constant micro stutter, even at 60 FPS. I searched far and wide, but as far as I can tell, there is no way to fix it. When walking or running, it is manageable, but when driving, it sometimes drives me mad. Hopefully, it will be fixed in the next release.

Another minor issues are the lack of animals in the game. The animals are super rare and only occasionally you see a chicken cross the road. There are mods that fix this but in vanilla, the hunter perks are useless.

But still, I think this is a great game and it came as a total surprise when I first played it. Definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to everyone.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCo-opMore...Jan 2, 202410",Only visible to you,True,N/A,N/A,N/A

But by far the best aspect of the game for me, is the sound and music. The music is, like I said, atmospheric and reacts to the situation you are in. It is nice and peaceful during the day and gets gloomy and dark when the apocalypse is coming. 

The sound effects of the tools, weapons and zombies are one of the best I ever heard in a game, I am not joking. The sound you get when firing a blunderbuss or shotgun is simply amazing. The sound design in 7 Days to Die is something I really miss in a lot of other games. I just want to hear and feel the impact of your guns or tools when you do something, and this game does just that. 10/10.

7 Days to Die is still in Alpha Early Access and has been since freaking 2013! It is updated regularly but personally I think it is time to switch to Beta or to release it fully. But because of the Early Access, the price for this game is incredibly fair and I must admit that I did not encounter that many bugs or problems.

One complaint I have with this game is that, since the Alpha 19 was released, the game has constant micro stutter, even at 60 FPS. I searched far and wide, but as far as I can tell, there is no way to fix it. When walking or running, it is manageable, but when driving, it sometimes drives me mad. Hopefully, it will be fixed in the next release.

Another minor issues are the lack of animals in the game. The animals are super rare and only occasionally you see a chicken cross the road. There are mods that fix this but in vanilla, the hunter perks are useless.

But still, I think this is a great game and it came as a total surprise when I first played it.

I love old school JRPG's but this homage to it falls short. Doesn't do much to keep you engaged when it comes to creativity nothing in this game I haven't seen. I find hard to grind for levels especially when they try to make this game harder than your typical RPG. If your going to raise the standard as far as difficulty goes then make it easy to grind. In order to grind you need to leave an area completely to respawn the baddies and then your xp gains are drastically low. After 3.5 hours I was level 4!

Cheers.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Aug 29, 202351Only visible to youVash4eNot RecommendedQuit4This was a tough one to review because in all honesty, it hits the right note on almost everything. It’s a fine RPG on a surface level but as you start to dig into it, it slowly starts to unearth itself as something that can be seen as shallow.

Which is a shame, because all of the individual aspects of the game feel and look really great. The pixel art has such style and it looks so well crafted that you want to be in there forever. The music hits all the right feelings that it wants to hit (special shout-out to the boss music!). And the battle mechanics have a fresh feel but also calls back to classics like Chrono Trigger and Mario RPG. It also has a simple plot that is easy to understand that also has its own twists and turns.

But the more I played this game, the more I started to feel discredited towards it. What looked like a game that was a pool full of great style and mechanics, quickly dissolved into a little rain puddle with no room for growth. Growth is the keyword here, because it doesn’t feel like I’m growing as a player, the leveling up and the battle system start to stagnate real fast here, and it underlines everything that this game tries to do. The dungeons, though some are fun, are very drawn out and start to drag 2/3rds of the way through them, and without any growth in between these segments, it makes the story elements really not matter much if the growth essentially stays the same for the most part.

I can appreciate some of the side quests once you really start the game and the lively characters you can recruit, but you eventually hit a wall knowing you will go through fight after fight but doing the same thing...over and over. It feels like the freedom of growth has been taken away, or maybe I’m too used to games like Persona and Xenoblade giving me tons of freedom of role playing how I personally like to role play.

With all this said, I had to drop this game, unfortunately. And it’s not something I can easily recommend to someone.

The execution, however, feels incomplete. I really enjoyed the characters and the setting in the first half of Sea of Stars. The level design and puzzles were entertaining, and the battles against monsters were also well-executed. However, in the second half, the battle system failed to evolve, resulting in long and often tedious encounters. Additionally, the story lost its initial appeal, which only added to the frustration. In conclusion, the first 15 hours of Sea of Stars offer a great RPG experience, but the second half becomes a slog.Jun 30, 202410Only visible to youIkkeMichiNot RecommendedQuit6LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Apr 30, 202410Only visible to youAlondonoNot RecommendedBeat5LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Apr 6, 202410Only visible to youGoldenGoofyNot RecommendedQuit5LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCombatMore...Apr 2, 202410Only visible to youAranothNot RecommendedBeat6Sep 5, 202311Only visible to youoscar45RecommendedPlaying10LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Jan 3, 202410Only visible to youMacFourRecommendedBeat10LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Jan 2, 202410Only visible to youElements0fStyleRecommendedPlaying9This is a classic JRPG with heavy inspiration from Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and Golden Sun.

The characters and the world Sabotage Studio created were easy to fall in love with. A wide variety of level designs and bosses keep the game feeling fresh, though while you do get plenty of new abilities, combos, and party members, the frequent use of spells learned very early in the game can become a bit stale by the end. The story has some very well written emotional beats, though I think the ending falls a bit flat, albeit creative. 

Overall, cannot recommend enough for fans of any traditional JRPG.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Dec 16, 202310Only visible to youLenny HadleyRecommendedBeat9If you’re a true fan of RPGs and particularly old school RPGs, this game is perfect.

Cheers.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Aug 29, 202351Only visible to youVash4eNot RecommendedQuit4This was a tough one to review because in all honesty, it hits the right note on almost everything. It’s a fine RPG on a surface level but as you start to dig into it, it slowly starts to unearth itself as something that can be seen as shallow.

Which is a shame, because all of the individual aspects of the game feel and look really great. The pixel art has such style and it looks so well crafted that you want to be in there forever. The music hits all the right feelings that it wants to hit (special shout-out to the boss music!). And the battle mechanics have a fresh feel but also calls back to classics like Chrono Trigger and Mario RPG. It also has a simple plot that is easy to understand that also has its own twists and turns.

But the more I played this game, the more I started to feel discredited towards it. What looked like a game that was a pool full of great style and mechanics, quickly dissolved into a little rain puddle with no room for growth. Growth is the keyword here, because it doesn’t feel like I’m growing as a player, the leveling up and the battle system start to stagnate real fast here, and it underlines everything that this game tries to do. The dungeons, though some are fun, are very drawn out and start to drag 2/3rds of the way through them, and without any growth in between these segments, it makes the story elements really not matter much if the growth essentially stays the same for the most part.

I can appreciate some of the side quests once you really start the game and the lively characters you can recruit, but you eventually hit a wall knowing you will go through fight after fight but doing the same thing...over and over. It feels like the freedom of growth has been taken away, or maybe I’m too used to games like Persona and Xenoblade giving me tons of freedom of role playing how I personally like to role play.

With all this said, I had to drop this game, unfortunately. And it’s not something I can easily recommend to someone.

The execution, however, feels incomplete. I really enjoyed the characters and the setting in the first half of Sea of Stars. The level design and puzzles were entertaining, and the battles against monsters were also well-executed. However, in the second half, the battle system failed to evolve, resulting in long and often tedious encounters. Additionally, the story lost its initial appeal, which only added to the frustration. In conclusion, the first 15 hours of Sea of Stars offer a great RPG experience, but the second half becomes a slog.Jun 30, 202410Only visible to youIkkeMichiNot RecommendedQuit6LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Apr 30, 202410Only visible to youAlondonoNot RecommendedBeat5LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Apr 6, 202410Only visible to youGoldenGoofyNot RecommendedQuit5LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCombatMore...Apr 2, 202410Only visible to youAranothNot RecommendedBeat6Sep 5, 202311Only visible to youoscar45RecommendedPlaying10LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Jan 3, 202410Only visible to youMacFourRecommendedBeat10LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Jan 2, 202410Only visible to youElements0fStyleRecommendedPlaying9This is a classic JRPG with heavy inspiration from Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and Golden Sun.

The characters and the world Sabotage Studio created were easy to fall in love with. A wide variety of level designs and bosses keep the game feeling fresh, though while you do get plenty of new abilities, combos, and party members, the frequent use of spells learned very early in the game can become a bit stale by the end.

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG","PopularScore - HighScore - LowNoneHas TextRecommendedNot RecommendedOnly visible to youTheRealNayNayRecommendedBeat8My best friend recommended this game to me — something that they thought I’d enjoy playing, despite the underlying plot that you help souls cross into the other side to the afterlife. They were 100% correct. 

This game had beautiful artwork, and the storyline and characters were all well thought out. Each character that you meet has a unique personality, tone and goals to add into your journey. The map and general workings of the game were easy enough to understand while having some mystery on how to navigate. The perfect balance of guidance and exploration (in my opinion). 

The pace of the game was great and was something that I was able to put a lot of hours into, yet didn’t feel rushed to finish. This is absolutely one of my favourite games that I’ve played in a long time. I would highly recommend to people and players who enjoy cozy gaming, exploration, narrative story lines and who can appreciate incredible gaming art styles. At the end of it, you hear many beautiful stories and lessons that you have likely learning in your real life. 


The reasons I didn’t award it 10/10 was for 2 things: (one which is absolutely subjective, sorry!) 

1. The ending (no spoilers), felt abrupt because the direction you receive is a bit vague. I wish that you would have had to complete all spirits journeys, and finish any unresolved quests before you complete the game. When I finished, it had said I only completed 90% of the quests which annoyed me.

2. I did run into a few technical glitches, which I’m sure isn’t an issue on other gaming platforms, this one shut down once for me, and then had a handful of lag-gy moments.

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Only visible to youTheRealNayNayRecommendedBeat8My best friend recommended this game to me — something that they thought I’d enjoy playing, despite the underlying plot that you help souls cross into the other side to the afterlife. They were 100% correct. 

This game had beautiful artwork, and the storyline and characters were all well thought out. Each character that you meet has a unique personality, tone and goals to add into your journey. The map and general workings of the game were easy enough to understand while having some mystery on how to navigate. The perfect balance of guidance and exploration (in my opinion). 

The pace of the game was great and was something that I was able to put a lot of hours into, yet didn’t feel rushed to finish. This is absolutely one of my favourite games that I’ve played in a long time. I would highly recommend to people and players who enjoy cozy gaming, exploration, narrative story lines and who can appreciate incredible gaming art styles. At the end of it, you hear many beautiful stories and lessons that you have likely learning in your real life. 


The reasons I didn’t award it 10/10 was for 2 things: (one which is absolutely subjective, sorry!) 

1. The ending (no spoilers), felt abrupt because the direction you receive is a bit vague. I wish that you would have had to complete all spirits journeys, and finish any unresolved quests before you complete the game. When I finished, it had said I only completed 90% of the quests which annoyed me.

2. I did run into a few technical glitches, which I’m sure isn’t an issue on other gaming platforms, this one shut down once for me, and then had a handful of lag-gy moments. I think there could be some updates for the switch to make it 100% user friendly and glitch-free.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Dec 20, 202420",Only visible to you,True,N/A,N/A,N/A

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,23.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual","PopularScore - HighScore - LowNoneHas TextRecommendedNot RecommendedOnly visible to youSayuri_SekaikamiNot RecommendedBeat5If you're a fan of Harry Potter world, it's worth looking into it, but if you're a gamer who loves a good story, well-written characters and interesting sidequests, brace yourself. 
Most of the efforts went into the visual stuff and design of the world so it would look believable. However, the plot, the overall scriptwriting, the dialogues, the characters, even voice acting are very mediocre and sometimes even bad. This game is full of chests but their contents are mostly rubbish. 
All in all, the character you're playing as is an avatar. A nobody. You don't have a history before Hogwarts. Noone really explains why you're so special and talented. The world won't react to your actions even if you're walking through the castle killing everyone you meet. And, if you're a Ravenclaw, you won't even get a chance to solve a riddle when you enter your house's common room. 

Among the good things, I personally loved flying on a broom and caring for the beasts. Also, the missions with Poppy Sweeting have the most beautiful level design,majestic beasts included. 
Hogwarts Legacy gives lots of things to explore. The designers and artists must have taken years to implement all the details in the castle. The battles can also be fun. Especially the final one is epic. 
I spent more than a hundred hours in this game but some things I played through in irritation or boredom. It's a one-time mediocre game for me.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,23.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual","Only visible to youSayuri_SekaikamiNot RecommendedBeat5If you're a fan of Harry Potter world, it's worth looking into it, but if you're a gamer who loves a good story, well-written characters and interesting sidequests, brace yourself. 
Most of the efforts went into the visual stuff and design of the world so it would look believable. However, the plot, the overall scriptwriting, the dialogues, the characters, even voice acting are very mediocre and sometimes even bad. This game is full of chests but their contents are mostly rubbish. 
All in all, the character you're playing as is an avatar. A nobody. You don't have a history before Hogwarts. Noone really explains why you're so special and talented. The world won't react to your actions even if you're walking through the castle killing everyone you meet. And, if you're a Ravenclaw, you won't even get a chance to solve a riddle when you enter your house's common room. 

Among the good things, I personally loved flying on a broom and caring for the beasts. Also, the missions with Poppy Sweeting have the most beautiful level design,majestic beasts included. 
Hogwarts Legacy gives lots of things to explore. The designers and artists must have taken years to implement all the details in the castle. The battles can also be fun. Especially the final one is epic. 
I spent more than a hundred hours in this game but some things I played through in irritation or boredom. It's a one-time mediocre game for me. Won't recommend but I don't regret playing it either.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 31, 2023114",Only visible to you,True,N/A,N/A,N/A

Simple mechanics: Nice learning curve and lots of good ideas in the puzzles.
Great art style: both graphics and sounds. 
A relaxing game, not too challenging. 
Personal warning: the themes could trigger some individuals, about sadness.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Mar 6, 202520Only visible to youLawsonLuckyRecommendedBeat7Obviously one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever played... however, I would say it's more of a one time experience/installation piece and I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

I would've rated higher if the marriage between its themes and gameplay was slightly better handled. Celeste came to mind straight away while playing this and how much better it portrayed mental health struggles through its level design. Gris a lot of the time can just feel like you're going from left to right to get the thing that'll take you to the next stage with no real weight behind it.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleDifficultyMore...Mar 1, 202520Only visible to youZa_UvekRecommendedBeat8Wow, GRIS is now easily one of my favourite games of all time. A lot of people throw around the old “this is video game art” for a lot of indie titles these days. But GRIS, is the very embodiment of art on it's own.

The game acts as a allegory for a girl overcoming grief or just a hard time through life in general. Regardless whether the message catches you or not, the sound, art style and animation will bombard your senses in a way that it's hard to disengage from. Really, everything has been shaped and moulded with the game-play toward what is close to perfection.

As for the game-play itself, it's pretty standard 2-D puzzle plat-former stuff and might seem rudimentary at first. But as the game progresses, the puzzles will stop to make you think and are surprisingly clever, but not hard enough to stop the flow of the game.

This game is worth every cent. And honestly, it is very hard to express what you'll be in for, so it's best experienced yourself. Please do add it to your collection even if you are slightly interested.Jun 8, 202510Only visible to youYNGLemonHopeRecommendedBeat10Beautiful, short and sweet experience that feels like more art than game. The controls were fluid and fun and the gameplay was simple but enjoyable. The music and sound design were amazing, felt very immersed in the beautiful environments. The story was simple but impactful, more through context than laying it out for you, which added to the overall atmosphere. Really loved it.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 18, 202510Only visible to youStrowckerRecommendedBeat9This game tauch me how to lose, not in a bad way, but as a lesson of life. It shows you how to lead with lost, how to keep going after all seems out of meaning. Life it's unfair and this is not only for you, everyone passes to a difficult time in life, and then you find a new significance to it eventually. It can be a new chance to what you already wanted, or a new thing, the future is never as we think it will be, and that's why you must live your present, and do your chooses daily. Of course, you aways must have a ""north"" where to go, but that's also about it, sometimes this north just disappear and you don't have even a compass anymore, and then life gives you the stars so you can learn how to guide yourself by the constellations, it's hard of course, but is the chance you have now and you need lead with that.

But talking about the game itself now, it's really really really beautiful, in all the ways it can be, scenarios, soundtrack, history, everything. The first time I saw this game was because of Cellbit, and I was about to watch it, but I perceived that wasn't any game, I felt it was a deep one, something I had to experience by myself, and it was a great choice, make my own interpretation about what I experienced, have my own feelings about what I saw, it was just magic. 

Furthermore, I played it near one of the most tragic experiences of sadness of my life, breaking up with my first and only girlfriend I had by now. We had a little more than one year together, but it seemed a lot more, and I lost her, because a mistake I have made. And after that I saw that I lead with that in a similar way that Gris leaded with her pain, ironically... Maybe was a sign of the universe.

This game have a incredibly short gameplay, but it's something you'll difficultly forget. I difficulty cry with things, but I dropped some tears at the ending, and it wasn't even because it was sad, it was actually very happy, and I felt amazed by everything.

Simple mechanics: Nice learning curve and lots of good ideas in the puzzles.
Great art style: both graphics and sounds. 
A relaxing game, not too challenging. 
Personal warning: the themes could trigger some individuals, about sadness.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Mar 6, 202520Only visible to youLawsonLuckyRecommendedBeat7Obviously one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever played... however, I would say it's more of a one time experience/installation piece and I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

I would've rated higher if the marriage between its themes and gameplay was slightly better handled. Celeste came to mind straight away while playing this and how much better it portrayed mental health struggles through its level design. Gris a lot of the time can just feel like you're going from left to right to get the thing that'll take you to the next stage with no real weight behind it.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleDifficultyMore...Mar 1, 202520Only visible to youZa_UvekRecommendedBeat8Wow, GRIS is now easily one of my favourite games of all time. A lot of people throw around the old “this is video game art” for a lot of indie titles these days. But GRIS, is the very embodiment of art on it's own.

The game acts as a allegory for a girl overcoming grief or just a hard time through life in general. Regardless whether the message catches you or not, the sound, art style and animation will bombard your senses in a way that it's hard to disengage from. Really, everything has been shaped and moulded with the game-play toward what is close to perfection.

As for the game-play itself, it's pretty standard 2-D puzzle plat-former stuff and might seem rudimentary at first. But as the game progresses, the puzzles will stop to make you think and are surprisingly clever, but not hard enough to stop the flow of the game.

This game is worth every cent. And honestly, it is very hard to express what you'll be in for, so it's best experienced yourself. Please do add it to your collection even if you are slightly interested.Jun 8, 202510Only visible to youYNGLemonHopeRecommendedBeat10Beautiful, short and sweet experience that feels like more art than game. The controls were fluid and fun and the gameplay was simple but enjoyable. The music and sound design were amazing, felt very immersed in the beautiful environments. The story was simple but impactful, more through context than laying it out for you, which added to the overall atmosphere. Really loved it.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 18, 202510Only visible to youStrowckerRecommendedBeat9This game tauch me how to lose, not in a bad way, but as a lesson of life. It shows you how to lead with lost, how to keep going after all seems out of meaning. Life it's unfair and this is not only for you, everyone passes to a difficult time in life, and then you find a new significance to it eventually. It can be a new chance to what you already wanted, or a new thing, the future is never as we think it will be, and that's why you must live your present, and do your chooses daily. Of course, you aways must have a ""north"" where to go, but that's also about it, sometimes this north just disappear and you don't have even a compass anymore, and then life gives you the stars so you can learn how to guide yourself by the constellations, it's hard of course, but is the chance you have now and you need lead with that.

But talking about the game itself now, it's really really really beautiful, in all the ways it can be, scenarios, soundtrack, history, everything. The first time I saw this game was because of Cellbit, and I was about to watch it, but I perceived that wasn't any game, I felt it was a deep one, something I had to experience by myself, and it was a great choice, make my own interpretation about what I experienced, have my own feelings about what I saw, it was just magic. 

Furthermore, I played it near one of the most tragic experiences of sadness of my life, breaking up with my first and only girlfriend I had by now. We had a little more than one year together, but it seemed a lot more, and I lost her, because a mistake I have made. And after that I saw that I lead with that in a similar way that Gris leaded with her pain, ironically... Maybe was a sign of the universe.

This game have a incredibly short gameplay, but it's something you'll difficultly forget. I difficulty cry with things, but I dropped some tears at the ending, and it wasn't even because it was sad, it was actually very happy, and I felt amazed by everything.

I had already played the Judgment spinoff  games, but not the original games in the series. This is also the first of the “new Yakuza” games with a new protagonist. I had no experience with Kiryu beforehand, so the change to a new guy didn’t really impact me at all. Like all Yakuza games, the story in this one is more long and convoluted than it needs to be, but the overall experience is very enjoyable. There are a lot of fun minigames and side quests to keep you occupied. The new fighting style introduced in this game is kind of a mixed bag. At times I really liked it, because it allowed me to basically put some fights on auto pilot, but at other times I didn’t like how it made some street fights last much longer than they needed to.

(Dark Souls is one of the few games of the decade held in higher esteem.) It has several elements that I enjoy in modern video games. Most notably:

Open world design
Combat designed by Platinum Games (Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, Transformers: Cybertron, etc)


I'm upset with Nier: Automata. I was bored and out like a light for the first 15 hours of this game. I was being nice as I wandered through this barren world, harvesting trash and slicing robot fodder into trash. This game is the equivalent of ripping a decent story into tiny pieces and scattering it over a football stadium.

The open world is barren to a fault. Whereas good open world games provide a large variety of content that is worth seeking out, most of Nier’s world is an empty space that must be traversed on foot for extended periods of time. There is no fast travel in this part of the game, and little to do so except haul yourself back and forth over the barren world, there is little reward to exploration. The combat quickly becomes tedious, since it mostly involves mashing on the attack button while your drone whittles down the mobs you face. By Platinum Games standards, not very deep.

Many of the early missions aren’t very well designed, either. Some of them are based on enemy loot drops that don’t appear. It doesn’t help that the broken map doesn’t properly show the location of these harvesting missions. I spent nearly an hour trying to figure out why I couldn’t complete one early mission.

The story might be good, but as my “ripping into tiny piece*****ogy states, that story is parceled out in such unsatisfyingly minor chunks that it feel like its spinning its wheels instead of making a point. Narrative efficiency seems irrelevant here. Which might be the point, but it’s an awfully pretentious way to make such a point.LIKED & DISLIKEDPacingProgressionMore...Oct 31, 202500Only visible to youpsalmamosNot RecommendedBeat6This isn’t the masterpiece I thought it was, had moments of deep reflection but doesn’t do anything with it.

It’s about the journey and the friends you make along the way. Stray’s gameplay is very solid. Fun, intriguing, and challenging. Perhaps a bit too challenging for my taste, as the game does not provide any guidance in terms of waypoints. I personally have no problem looking up guides, so this is a minor inconvenience for a 4.5 hour game. Most of all Stray is hoisted up by it’s strong characters, most notably b12, and it’s deep and profound story. A great experience all around.May 28, 202310Only visible to youocm__1RecommendedBeat76d ago00Only visible to youDcorrianRecommendedBeat7LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...6d ago00Only visible to youCrossoverLXRecommendedBeat8LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityFamily-FriendlyMore...6d ago00Only visible to youPierre LinRecommendedBeat8LIKED & DISLIKEDArt Style7d ago00Only visible to youMardle07RecommendedBeat77d ago00Only visible to youImAkiiraRecommendedBeat87d ago00Only visible to youplatax6RecommendedBeat107d ago00Only visible to youRuca42RecommendedBeat78d ago00Only visible to younmoya157RecommendedBeat109d ago00Only visible to youAdamTeller98RecommendedBeat7LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...9d ago00Only visible to youFiglinRecommendedBeat89d ago00",Only visible to you,True,N/A,N/A,N/A

From the very start, you get a sense of how grand your adventure will be when you plunge into the depths of the Forgotten Crossroads. 

From there,  you dash, slash, and jump through every single room looking to unravel the mystery of Hollownest's fate. And speaking of slashing and jumping, Hollow Knight features the best movement I think I have ever played in a video game. The Knight moves just quick enough, jumps just high enough (with upgrades to this movement coming as you play) to make every interaction with enemies, platforms, and bosses feel buttery smooth.

Hollow Knight's combat also feels so satisfying (special nod to the sound design, I will literally never get tired of the shpleck sound of your nail striking enemies). The game is hard, sometimes frustratingly so, but as many players before me mention, fights can almost always be overcome with clever charm strategies and really focusing on attack patterns. 

Maybe most importantly, the game is also stunningly beautiful. Each new area felt so well cared for and meticulously designed with floors, backgrounds, and enemies to match their atmospheres. 

After beating the main storyline, I was totally motivated to keep playing since I know there's tons more to collect, beat, and discover. But I must admit, I have lost just a bit of steam with getting to that coveted 112% clear rate, because like I said before, everything now is pretty darn hard. But so fun. So I still can't put down this beauty of a game. One of the best games I've ever played and easily the standard for a metroidvania.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 6, 202520Only visible to youEdge901900RecommendedBeat9Review: Hollow Knight — A Masterpiece of Darkness and Discovery

Few games manage to blend beauty, melancholy, and challenge as seamlessly as Hollow Knight. Team Cherry’s indie gem isn’t just a platformer or an action game — it’s a quiet odyssey through a fallen world, one that rewards curiosity and perseverance in equal measure.
From the moment you descend into Hallownest, you feel it: the weight of a kingdom long dead, whispering through the ruins. The world is vast and interconnected, filled with hidden paths, cryptic characters, and secrets tucked just out of reach. Every new area feels distinct — from the tranquil decay of Greenpath to the eerie depths of Deepnest — all painted in a somber, hand-drawn art style that’s both beautiful and haunting.

The combat is deceptively simple yet brutally fair. The Knight’s nail strikes with precision, and every upgrade — from charms to spells — adds depth without diluting the difficulty. Bosses are fierce and unforgettable, each one a test of patience, skill, and rhythm. Victory never feels cheap; every triumph is earned.

But what truly makes Hollow Knight extraordinary is its atmosphere. Christopher Larkin’s score drifts between sorrow and serenity, perfectly echoing the loneliness and quiet hope that define Hallownest. The storytelling is subtle, buried in item descriptions, environmental hints, and fleeting dialogue. It’s a narrative you uncover, not one you’re told — and that makes it all the more powerfulLIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Nov 6, 202510Only visible to youJoshuatooker43RecommendedBeat10Sep 17, 202510Only visible to youMrAlmendritasRecommendedBeat10Odio las polillas y amo al caballeritoLIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Sep 20, 202510Only visible to youMcAirthRecommendedBeat10Hollow knight is a game that will last the test of age and has for me so far.

The art is simply superb, blending 2D and 3D flawlessly, with a beautiful and detailed world. The music is also absolutely top notch. The controls are precise, some of the best I've ever seen in 2D games.

My only problem with this game was the exploration: by giving too much freedom and places to go all at once, it was pretty common for me to run all around the world, finding progress wall after progress walls because I hadn't unlocked the required upgrades yet. The result was constant backtracking, and so many pins (markers) on the map that you eventually lose control of what is what - leading to more backtracking when you get an upgrade and have to revisit every pin on the map to see if it was the progress wall fit for your recent upgrade. I got lost many times, and at almost all of them I felt  that it was the level design's fault, not mine. 

In short, Hollow Knight is a fantastic game, with top notch art direction, but packed with some dubious level design choices here and there that will make you lose time and patience - and because of that some will drop the game out of sheer frustration.

After beating the main storyline, I was totally motivated to keep playing since I know there's tons more to collect, beat, and discover. But I must admit, I have lost just a bit of steam with getting to that coveted 112% clear rate, because like I said before, everything now is pretty darn hard. But so fun. So I still can't put down this beauty of a game. One of the best games I've ever played and easily the standard for a metroidvania.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 6, 202520Only visible to youEdge901900RecommendedBeat9Review: Hollow Knight — A Masterpiece of Darkness and Discovery

Few games manage to blend beauty, melancholy, and challenge as seamlessly as Hollow Knight. Team Cherry’s indie gem isn’t just a platformer or an action game — it’s a quiet odyssey through a fallen world, one that rewards curiosity and perseverance in equal measure.
From the moment you descend into Hallownest, you feel it: the weight of a kingdom long dead, whispering through the ruins. The world is vast and interconnected, filled with hidden paths, cryptic characters, and secrets tucked just out of reach. Every new area feels distinct — from the tranquil decay of Greenpath to the eerie depths of Deepnest — all painted in a somber, hand-drawn art style that’s both beautiful and haunting.

The combat is deceptively simple yet brutally fair. The Knight’s nail strikes with precision, and every upgrade — from charms to spells — adds depth without diluting the difficulty. Bosses are fierce and unforgettable, each one a test of patience, skill, and rhythm. Victory never feels cheap; every triumph is earned.

But what truly makes Hollow Knight extraordinary is its atmosphere. Christopher Larkin’s score drifts between sorrow and serenity, perfectly echoing the loneliness and quiet hope that define Hallownest. The storytelling is subtle, buried in item descriptions, environmental hints, and fleeting dialogue. It’s a narrative you uncover, not one you’re told — and that makes it all the more powerfulLIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Nov 6, 202510Only visible to youJoshuatooker43RecommendedBeat10Sep 17, 202510Only visible to youMrAlmendritasRecommendedBeat10Odio las polillas y amo al caballeritoLIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Sep 20, 202510Only visible to youMcAirthRecommendedBeat10Hollow knight is a game that will last the test of age and has for me so far.

The art is simply superb, blending 2D and 3D flawlessly, with a beautiful and detailed world. The music is also absolutely top notch. The controls are precise, some of the best I've ever seen in 2D games.

My only problem with this game was the exploration: by giving too much freedom and places to go all at once, it was pretty common for me to run all around the world, finding progress wall after progress walls because I hadn't unlocked the required upgrades yet. The result was constant backtracking, and so many pins (markers) on the map that you eventually lose control of what is what - leading to more backtracking when you get an upgrade and have to revisit every pin on the map to see if it was the progress wall fit for your recent upgrade. I got lost many times, and at almost all of them I felt  that it was the level design's fault, not mine. 

In short, Hollow Knight is a fantastic game, with top notch art direction, but packed with some dubious level design choices here and there that will make you lose time and patience - and because of that some will drop the game out of sheer frustration.

As a person who loves atmospheric games, this game was amazing from the start.
I LOVED the empty dystopian-type setting that had me guessing where the heck I was from the start.
Characters were amazing, it had the perfect amount of interaction but not too much because its supposed to take place in an abandoned realm.
I won't give spoilers but I really really liked the ending.

I made it about 50% and it took me forever. I may return to it at some point but for now i am going to give it a rest. I wish more of these types of games would implement a system like Hades did in order to allow people to progress without having to go to full on invincibility. The adaptable help allows you to progress with a challenge. I thought that was a huge success. If you have to go to God mode it just destroys the game but a little help to not be stuck for a ridiculous amount of time is welcome to keep the game progressing.   I really want to see and explore the rest of the world but some of the Boss encounters just had me hitting the wall with no way to progress.Dec 10, 202351Only visible to youhenryRecommendedPaused10This review contains spoilers.ShowLIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Sep 4, 202350Only visible to youPebblePlaysRecommendedBeat10This game made me who I am today and that's a very confusing thing.

From the very start, you get a sense of how grand your adventure will be when you plunge into the depths of the Forgotten Crossroads. 

From there,  you dash, slash, and jump through every single room looking to unravel the mystery of Hollownest's fate. And speaking of slashing and jumping, Hollow Knight features the best movement I think I have ever played in a video game. The Knight moves just quick enough, jumps just high enough (with upgrades to this movement coming as you play) to make every interaction with enemies, platforms, and bosses feel buttery smooth.

Hollow Knight's combat also feels so satisfying (special nod to the sound design, I will literally never get tired of the shpleck sound of your nail striking enemies). The game is hard, sometimes frustratingly so, but as many players before me mention, fights can almost always be overcome with clever charm strategies and really focusing on attack patterns.

The story is truly remarkable showing the struggles of two brothers. 

I one of Life is Strange 2’s strengths is its willingness to address relevant social issues.

Heartbreaking story if imperfectLIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleJul 18, 202410Only visible to youBas van DunRecommendedBeat9Life is Strange 2 takes the successful narrative-driven formula of the first game and ventures into new, more mature territories. This episodic adventure follows the Diaz brothers, Sean and Daniel, who are forced to flee their Seattle home after a tragic incident leaves them on the run from the law.

The game's strength lies in its emotional depth and character development. Sean, as the older brother, assumes a parental role, guiding Daniel and influencing his moral compass through the decisions players make. This dynamic is at the heart of the game, providing a poignant exploration of brotherhood, responsibility, and the loss of innocence.

The journey across America is fraught with socio-political themes, including immigration, racism, and identity, making Life is Strange 2 more grounded and relevant than its predecessor. These themes are woven into the narrative seamlessly, often presenting morally grey choices that challenge players' perspectives.

The gameplay was just alright - the movement is way too slow, the puzzles are repetitive and the load screens on Switch are way too long. The map could be better - hard to see and unclear where to go at times.

Looking forward to the sequel.Mar 3, 202310Only visible to youPesitarioRecommendedBeat8This game is a very good fit for a rainy weekend and should be enjoyed with a calm mind and a warm tea.

Mechanically it falls somewhere inbetween a modern puzzle-game like „Limbo“ or „Inside“ and a classic adventure with point‘n‘click vibes and interesting dialogue and good voice-acting.

The sum of it‘s parts combine to a moody „X-Files“-like experience, that is driven by it‘s strong sound-design, tense mystery and like-able characters.

I played through it on a weekend and the experience stuck with me for years.

Aside from its obvious strength in art direction, it manages to encapsulate such an unique experience mainly through its story-telling abilities. It truly is, as Killmonday Games claims, an interactive narrative. Even though it is a short game, its replay-ability is fantastic due to the different choices you have as our main character, Misfortune. My only complaint is its price. Even though it's a wonderful game, $30 (AUD) is a bit much for 3 hours of game play, even if it should be replayed as previously mentioned.

I got recommended this game ages ago and I finally bought and played it and wow I'm a changed person. Some games you play and you just know it's going to be great and this is definitely one of them. God this game was brilliant. I got it on sale for $9 down from $30. While it's a great game I would not pay $30 for it as it only took me 3 hours to finish and while it's an amazing game $30 for 3 hours of gameplay is a bit steep.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleEnd GameMore...Feb 18, 202410Only visible to you_KatRecommendedBeat9I did my second play-through of Little Misfortune and I liked it even more than I remembered. Aside from its obvious strength in art direction, it manages to encapsulate such an unique experience mainly through its story-telling abilities. It truly is, as Killmonday Games claims, an interactive narrative. Even though it is a short game, its replay-ability is fantastic due to the different choices you have as our main character, Misfortune. My only complaint is its price. Even though it's a wonderful game, $30 (AUD) is a bit much for 3 hours of game play, even if it should be replayed as previously mentioned. It might take away from the experience if players feel done in by the end of it.

This was my first roguelike years ago, and I wasn't able to finish it back then. But I recently picked it up on mobile. After playing games like Hades and Balatro I got a better concept and understanding of what roguelike is. Also, this is a fantastic game and my favorite part of it is the difficulty. It feels much more balanced than the other two I mentioned. It's almost like in most roguelikes, you can spike up or down in terms of power. However, Slay the Spire always feels like you have a chance. I'm a fan, and in some ways, I have more fun with it than more popular roguelikes.

I loved everything about it: the art style, the combat, the difficulty, I could not stop playing until I'd completed every main and side quest. It has its humorous moments as well! 

Only real issue I had is sometimes when a card got added to the field it pushed another card/stack of cards out of the way and they would glitch and keep running to the edge of the screen no matter where I placed them.

Progress: Platinum Trophy + 100%’d DLC 

As soon as I launched Cuphead on my PS4, I was immediately struck by its unique aesthetic. The game’s hand-drawn animation, inspired by 1930s cartoons, is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual style feels authentic and refreshing—especially in an era where most 2D side-scrollers follow a familiar, often predictable, formula. Cuphead feels like a love letter to classic animation, with vibrant colors, quirky character designs, and an old-school vibe that sets it apart from nearly every other game in the genre.
Gameplay-wise, Cuphead is a beast. The bosses are as tough as they are creative, each one offering a new challenge that demands precision, patience, and quick reflexes. The difficulty spike can be brutal at times—especially the expert mode S-rank challenges and the pacifist runs, where you’re tasked with completing levels without killing any enemies. These challenges pushed my skills to the limit and truly tested my perseverance. If you love a tough challenge, this game will satisfy that craving, but be prepared to grind.
While I played solo, I can only imagine how chaotic and fun it must be in co-op mode. There’s something about the cooperative aspect of Cuphead that just feels like it would amplify the challenge, making it even more rewarding. For those like me who tackle it alone, however, the sense of accomplishment after defeating a particularly tough boss is incredibly satisfying.
One thing that made my experience smoother was switching up the controller layout settings. If you’re diving into Cuphead, I highly recommend adjusting the attack and gun fire buttons to R2 or a trigger button, it makes a world of difference during intense moments. If you’re into games that challenge you to improve with every attempt, Cuphead is a must-play.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Nov 23, 202420Only visible to youkatyRecommendedQuit8SO HARD. but I'm also bad at games lol.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Jul 4, 202320Only visible to youIdlRecommendedBeat8divertido, dificultad perfecta, y un estilo de arte brutal. necesitamos más juegos boss rush

8,5/10Aug 16, 202410Only visible to youOptimus_BelmontRecommended7Cuphead is brutally hard, but the more you play it the better you get. It doesn’t feel unfair but it does test one’s metal. I died 545 times before rolling credits. Love the 1930s old school cartoon aesthetic and jazzy score. The animation work is so well done. Hats off to this small indie studio. Not a lot of gameplay variety. Wasn’t expecting it to be a series of boss battles but once you get used to the gameplay loop it’s not bad. Looking forward to checking out the DLC later but need a break before jumping back in. Overall a good game!LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCombatMore...Jan 15, 202410Only visible to youCoevexRecommendedBeat10Nov 27, 202310Only visible to youbman0424RecommendedQuit10The art style alone is enough to warrant a good ratingJul 6, 202310Only visible to youohshiiirtNot Recommended1most difficult game EVERLIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Mar 26, 202315Only visible to youf-r-e-s-kRecommendedBeat106d ago00Only visible to youtinnsOMEGARecommendedBeat10Holy cow, dancing with the devil has never been so tempting.

In Cuphead, you'll find a truly grueling experience that keeps you coming back every time you lose just to get those boss patterns down. It's a formidable challenge and is surely to satiate all run-n-gun lovers seeking a well rounded, modern day Mega Man or Contra spiritual successor. 

-The gameplay is top notch with sharp and responsive player movement. 
-Bosses brimming with intense fun
-Stellar, stellar, stellar graphics. Absolute *chef's kiss*

It's silly but slightly dark. You'd be hard pressed to find a game quite like this anywhere. It is undoubtedly a timeless classic that could be played 200 years from now and look and feel beautiful. 

Sincerely a masterpiece that I wish I'd played sooner.

Progress: Platinum Trophy + 100%’d DLC 

As soon as I launched Cuphead on my PS4, I was immediately struck by its unique aesthetic. The game’s hand-drawn animation, inspired by 1930s cartoons, is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual style feels authentic and refreshing—especially in an era where most 2D side-scrollers follow a familiar, often predictable, formula. Cuphead feels like a love letter to classic animation, with vibrant colors, quirky character designs, and an old-school vibe that sets it apart from nearly every other game in the genre.
Gameplay-wise, Cuphead is a beast. The bosses are as tough as they are creative, each one offering a new challenge that demands precision, patience, and quick reflexes. The difficulty spike can be brutal at times—especially the expert mode S-rank challenges and the pacifist runs, where you’re tasked with completing levels without killing any enemies. These challenges pushed my skills to the limit and truly tested my perseverance. If you love a tough challenge, this game will satisfy that craving, but be prepared to grind.
While I played solo, I can only imagine how chaotic and fun it must be in co-op mode. There’s something about the cooperative aspect of Cuphead that just feels like it would amplify the challenge, making it even more rewarding. For those like me who tackle it alone, however, the sense of accomplishment after defeating a particularly tough boss is incredibly satisfying.
One thing that made my experience smoother was switching up the controller layout settings. If you’re diving into Cuphead, I highly recommend adjusting the attack and gun fire buttons to R2 or a trigger button, it makes a world of difference during intense moments. If you’re into games that challenge you to improve with every attempt, Cuphead is a must-play.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Nov 23, 202420Only visible to youkatyRecommendedQuit8SO HARD. but I'm also bad at games lol.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCharactersMore...Jul 4, 202320Only visible to youIdlRecommendedBeat8divertido, dificultad perfecta, y un estilo de arte brutal. necesitamos más juegos boss rush

8,5/10Aug 16, 202410Only visible to youOptimus_BelmontRecommended7Cuphead is brutally hard, but the more you play it the better you get. It doesn’t feel unfair but it does test one’s metal. I died 545 times before rolling credits. Love the 1930s old school cartoon aesthetic and jazzy score. The animation work is so well done. Hats off to this small indie studio. Not a lot of gameplay variety. Wasn’t expecting it to be a series of boss battles but once you get used to the gameplay loop it’s not bad. Looking forward to checking out the DLC later but need a break before jumping back in. Overall a good game!LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCombatMore...Jan 15, 202410Only visible to youCoevexRecommendedBeat10Nov 27, 202310Only visible to youbman0424RecommendedQuit10The art style alone is enough to warrant a good ratingJul 6, 202310Only visible to youohshiiirtNot Recommended1most difficult game EVERLIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Mar 26, 202315Only visible to youf-r-e-s-kRecommendedBeat106d ago00Only visible to youtinnsOMEGARecommendedBeat10Holy cow, dancing with the devil has never been so tempting.

In Cuphead, you'll find a truly grueling experience that keeps you coming back every time you lose just to get those boss patterns down. It's a formidable challenge and is surely to satiate all run-n-gun lovers seeking a well rounded, modern day Mega Man or Contra spiritual successor. 

-The gameplay is top notch with sharp and responsive player movement. 
-Bosses brimming with intense fun
-Stellar, stellar, stellar graphics. Absolute *chef's kiss*

It's silly but slightly dark. You'd be hard pressed to find a game quite like this anywhere. It is undoubtedly a timeless classic that could be played 200 years from now and look and feel beautiful. 

Sincerely a masterpiece that I wish I'd played sooner.

Now for the Delicious Last Course!

I found the overall story to be pretty standard at first glance. But as it progressed, I was pleased to see that the writing contained some great humour and cleverly tied into the platforming itself. I don't want to spoil anything, but the way the game transitions from normal platformer to metroidvania is brilliant! In saying that, there was some great character progression that accompanies some very tight gameplay. Every time things did get difficult it was tough but very fair. Needless to say, the gameplay blended in beautifully with the 8/16 bit graphics and top notch soundtrack. It's hard to write too much as this is a title that shouldn't be spoiled.

(Played via Remote Play)

There are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. However, Unrailed! has something unique. You need to transport a train from point A to point B, while completing the tracks under its wheels. 

You need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. The multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task.

After each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. However, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track.

When your little train crashes, it is game over. All progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. 

Unrailed! uses simple, ""Minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. The character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving.

The sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background.

Control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn. 

Overall, I liked Unrailed! especially with some friends on a Saturday night. It offers some quick casual fun and with its unique concept, I would surely recommend it.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleFamily-FriendlyMore...Apr 23, 202500Only visible to youFrajolaNot RecommendedBeat6Apr 10, 202500Only visible to youImValllRecommendedQuit8LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Mar 4, 202500Only visible to youFortyVsZeroNot Recommended6Feb 12, 202500Only visible to youSundanceRecommendedBeat7Jan 24, 202500Only visible to youÁlex!RecommendedBeat9Jan 11, 202500Only visible to yousasasaRecommendedBeat9LIKED & DISLIKEDMechanicsDec 17, 202400Only visible to youGamerRecommended8LIKED & DISLIKEDCo-opDifficultyMore...Oct 30, 202400Only visible to youGhernotRecommended10Oct 17, 202400Only visible to youXibaNot RecommendedBeat6Sep 12, 202400Only visible to youPunchitaRecommendedBeat8Jul 4, 202400Only visible to youAndreretsuRecommendedBeat8Jun 22, 202400Only visible to youDeezer34RecommendedQuit7LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCo-opMore...Jun 15, 202400Only visible to youJustcause97RecommendedBeat8Apr 14, 202400Only visible to youp4koNot RecommendedPlaying10Apr 13, 202400","PopularScore - HighScore - LowNoneHas TextRecommendedNot RecommendedOnly visible to youcheesewedge12RecommendedQuit7Oct 26, 202500Only visible to youMax222222RecommendedBeat7Oct 15, 202500Only visible to youThe7thGodRecommendedPlaying8LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Sep 29, 202500Only visible to youDavidliam1966Not RecommendedBeat6Aug 22, 202500Only visible to youPtiBouchonNot RecommendedBeat6Jul 13, 202500Only visible to youLuitenant GruberRecommendedBeat7Fun game with fresh concept.

The soundtrack is AMAZING and the combination of metroidvania combat + rogue-lite elements create a perfect storm. The gameplay loop is addicting and the rush of finding a new enemy you haven't come across yet is both exciting and terrifying. 

And have I mentioned the weapons?? There's seemingly so much build variation and none feel boring or underpowered. Every time I found something new to try, whether a primary weapon or equipment, I was genuinely excited because I knew I'd be in for a treat.

This game has me looking forward to trying more rogue-lites, but there's also no doubt in my mind that I'll be returning to Dead Cells for a long time. I can't wait to explore more of the DLCs and dive further into the post-game / end-game content.

My one gripe is there isn't really an enticing story, but this game is so good I honestly don't mind.

There is only one level and its a small square. Its not bad at first but it feels very plain after a while. Even though vampire survivors levels are really empty, the small differences help keep the levels entertaining. This game feels repetitive cuz the level is always the same. They should at least add some obstacles or something. 

The game doesnt really scale well. I played on the second difficulty level and could not get past round 16. I dont believe its because of my skill or poor luck. I tried to beat it for hours and i would always die cuz i either couldnt outrun something or i would get swarmed & couldnt kill quick enough.

The game also lacks the incentive to play. The only incentive is to unlock the 60 characters. Usually i would like this but every character feels very similar so they all blend together. You also unlock a ton of them at the beggining but the rest are locked behind difficult requirements. Once i stopped unlocking characters and i kept getting stuck on the same round, i lost interest and gave up.Jun 20, 202410Only visible to youIchigo0VarelaNot Recommended6Apr 29, 202410Only visible to youKumaThePowerfulNot RecommendedBeat6Apr 8, 202410Only visible to youSebastian ThylinNot RecommendedQuit6Mar 20, 202410Only visible to youwjuninNot RecommendedQuit2Mar 16, 202410Only visible to youAndresitoNot RecommendedBeat5Nov 9, 202500Only visible to youTupperkingRecommendedBeat7Nov 3, 202500Only visible to yougairarrRecommendedBeat9Nov 2, 202500Only visible to youGoodGuyJudgyRecommendedBeat7Oct 30, 202500Only visible to youFabuloniusRecommendedBeat10Jan 21, 202500Only visible to youISPMPGRecommendedBeat10Oct 27, 202500Only visible to youAcherontRecommended8Sep 21, 202500Only visible to youRaksopgRecommendedPlaying9LIKED & DISLIKEDBalanceCombatMore...Sep 18, 202500Only visible to youTitanACRecommended7Sep 6, 202500Only visible to youRecommendedBeat10Aug 29, 202500Only visible to youchillibrown420Recommended10Aug 26, 202500Only visible to youbugxiii-iiRecommendedBeat7Aug 20, 202500","PopularScore - HighScore - LowNoneHas TextRecommendedNot RecommendedOnly visible to youWindelfurzNot RecommendedQuit2Jul 24, 202410Only visible to youThiphobiaRecommendedQuit6LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Jul 6, 202410Only visible to youmarionggNot RecommendedBeat6Jun 28, 202410Only visible to youesimp18Not RecommendedQuit6This game is fun at first but there are issues with replayability, scaling, and incentive to play.

Building the sequel around Melinoë was so perfect. The quests, characters, and world-building are multilayered and sophisticated while staying true to the original’s spirit. Like the Hades I, the graphics are breathtaking. Combat is balanced, fluid, and endlessly re-playable, with new weapons that give you a creative set of combos by Olympian boons. The new Arcana card system adds another layer of strategy that makes every run feel different if you want to experiment with them.
As a Greek, I’m blown away by the respect and creativity in how the studio use mythology. They nailed the details, the characters, and the storytelling accuracy, while keeping it fun and modern. The amount of care put into the narrative is unbelievable. Seriously. This is one of the very few sequels that it's a masterpiece and not just another sequel.

I wanted to enjoy this much more than I did.  The concept, graphics, and sound design are all right up my alley.

I found the control scheme somehow simultaneously too simplistic and overly complex.  Access various zones from a central hub.  Push into the enemies to attack them, to the beat of the music.  Solve some light puzzles to defeat creative, characterful bosses and open new areas.

Early on I felt like victory was essentially random, with lucky drops making the difference between success and failure. 
 But despite the simplicity it's a steep learning curve, and the training zones became essential for me towards the end of the core story.  I don't know if it's partly the fault of the hardware - the stick and shoulder buttons of the Switch felt sluggish to me throughout - or just that pushing one button 99% of the time doesn't have enough depth to hold me, but practicing and ultimately beating the game started to feel like work.

Oh my GOD! What a journey! My very first fromsoft game finished!!!! My inner child ****ing leapt for joy the moment it happened!!!! 

I only ever understood the feeling of playing these from an outsider looking in perspective!! For years I was terrified to take on the challenge. Is it hard? HELL YEA! Will it make you question your abilities?? MAYBE. Is it an absolutely MASSIVE undertaking?? OH. HEEEELLL YEA. Is it also an absolutely beautiful high fantasy game centered around exploration and proving to yourself that you can overcome every god damn challenge that’s thrown in your path??? HELL. ****ING. YEA!!!!!!!! Where I was once but a baby fan, watching from the sidelines. I now stand before you a full fledged ELDEN LORD!!! 

Now the game is of course stellar but I do have to say. As a ADHD having *** ***** the lack of even a journal for quests was a bit frustrating. But there is SO much to see and find and do that I feel many probably missed A-LOT on that first playthrough. Plus I’m a newbie to the genre so still have to get used to how questing in many of these works.

I started playing back during release, and stopped about 5% through the game. What a mistake that was! I didn't know what I was missing! This has to be my favorite open world game I have ever played. Elden Ring does not suffer the same issues as other open worlds. In this game, you are suggested the correct path, but you can go almost anywhere you want whenever you want, minus a few key bosses that unlock certain areas. When I say this game has hundreds of hours of content, I mean it. There is always something to do. Even when you finish the game, You can go back through it as many times as you want on the same character. By far my favorite feature of the game is the build crafting. Not only can you spec into hyper-specific builds that specialize greatly in a few skills, you can also completely change your build about a dozen times per save! If you end up not liking your build, there is a very early game boss that unlocks the ability to completely re-spec into whatever you want.

I have yet to beat this game, but I have been playing it for 100 hours and have yet to be tired of it at all. This game will grab you by the throat and never let go. The massive rush of dopamine after beating a tough boss is only found in Fromsoft games like this. Every victory feels like a revelation.

Highly recommended. 9.9/10. You just can't miss this one.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 27, 202420Only visible to youGrimnowNRecommendedBeat10This game blew me out of the water! When I first heard about Elden Ring, I was like ""meh"", but when I finally decided to give it a try and oh boy was it worth it. The map is huge, and there is so much content to do. Completing everything the game has to offer to the last nook and cranny will take over 150 hours for an average player, and it never gets boring.

The only negative thing I have to say is how the difficulty curves. It was a steady curve for the most part, but when you get to the endgame the difficulty spikes significantly, and suddenly you're struggling with the most basic enemies again. The whole game is frustrating because of the difficulty, which for a souls game isn't a problem, but the endgame was a new level of frustration, and took away from some of the fun from my experience. But who knows, maybe I was just playing unoptimally. 

Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes difficult games.LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleCo-opMore...Mar 3, 202420Only visible to yourobonix50RecommendedBeat10El besto souls y el besto mundo abierto, que más quieres?LIKED & DISLIKEDArt StyleBalanceMore...Dec 10, 202320Only visible to youCap0t3kawaiRecommendedBeat10Oct 29, 202321Only visible to youHonshu_WhoRecommended9The feeling of playing a massive game while your friends also play, and sharing your discoveries and tragedies... unmatched.

The best game I’ve ever played and I’ve played a lot I have 300 hours and it’s addictive. So many bosses and places to explore. I mean just recently there was a sub Area that I found with over 300 hours in the game. Excellent characters but you can’t get too attached to them, amazing soundtrack.

I AM THE ELDEN LORD!!!!! RAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!

Oh my GOD! What a journey! My very first fromsoft game finished!!!! My inner child ****ing leapt for joy the moment it happened!!!! 

I only ever understood the feeling of playing these from an outsider looking in perspective!! For years I was terrified to take on the challenge. Is it hard? HELL YEA! Will it make you question your abilities?? MAYBE. Is it an absolutely MASSIVE undertaking?? OH. HEEEELLL YEA. Is it also an absolutely beautiful high fantasy game centered around exploration and proving to yourself that you can overcome every god damn challenge that’s thrown in your path??? HELL. ****ING. YEA!!!!!!!! Where I was once but a baby fan, watching from the sidelines. I now stand before you a full fledged ELDEN LORD!!! 

Now the game is of course stellar but I do have to say. As a ADHD having *** ***** the lack of even a journal for quests was a bit frustrating. But there is SO much to see and find and do that I feel many probably missed A-LOT on that first playthrough. Plus I’m a newbie to the genre so still have to get used to how questing in many of these works. 

I need more of these now. I’m officially apart of the souls-like cult.

Dark Souls, Bloodbourne and Sekiro already felt massive in scale despite not being open world, not sure if we really needed this to be open world. I wouldn’t mind it as much if I didn’t have to go through what felt like the same 5 mini dungeons 1,000 times over. BUT, the legacy dungeons in this game stand among the series best. And all the main bosses in this game are incredible, the enemy design all around is phenomenal. In the end, this is big dark souls, for better or worse.Apr 7, 202430Only visible to youjrowland720Recommended9Absolutely amazing game that I will remember forever.

I started playing back during release, and stopped about 5% through the game. What a mistake that was! I didn't know what I was missing! This has to be my favorite open world game I have ever played. Elden Ring does not suffer the same issues as other open worlds. In this game, you are suggested the correct path, but you can go almost anywhere you want whenever you want, minus a few key bosses that unlock certain areas. When I say this game has hundreds of hours of content, I mean it. There is always something to do. Even when you finish the game, You can go back through it as many times as you want on the same character. By far my favorite feature of the game is the build crafting. Not only can you spec into hyper-specific builds that specialize greatly in a few skills, you can also completely change your build about a dozen times per save! If you end up not liking your build, there is a very early game boss that unlocks the ability to completely re-spec into whatever you want.

I have yet to beat this game, but I have been playing it for 100 hours and have yet to be tired of it at all. This game will grab you by the throat and never let go. The massive rush of dopamine after beating a tough boss is only found in Fromsoft games like this. Every victory feels like a revelation.

Highly recommended. 9.9/10. You just can't miss this one.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...May 27, 202420Only visible to youGrimnowNRecommendedBeat10This game blew me out of the water! When I first heard about Elden Ring, I was like ""meh"", but when I finally decided to give it a try and oh boy was it worth it. The map is huge, and there is so much content to do. Completing everything the game has to offer to the last nook and cranny will take over 150 hours for an average player, and it never gets boring.

The only negative thing I have to say is how the difficulty curves. It was a steady curve for the most part, but when you get to the endgame the difficulty spikes significantly, and suddenly you're struggling with the most basic enemies again. The whole game is frustrating because of the difficulty, which for a souls game isn't a problem, but the endgame was a new level of frustration, and took away from some of the fun from my experience.

So, Mortal Shell is officially the first FromSoft-ish Souls-like I didn’t rage-quit halfway through and uninstall out of pure self-loathing. Progress! 🎉

Look, I’ve tried to join the “Git Gud” cult and be That Guy who flexes about finishing Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Reality check:

Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition prepared me to die - repeatedly.

Bloodborne convinced me I was ready as I smacked the Cleric Beast around and thought, “Wow, maybe I’m good at this!” Enter Father Gascoigne who absolutely wrecked me over and over until I accepted my fate as a casual.

I’ve beaten games that get labeled “Souls-like” - Vampyr, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - but let’s be real, those are more story-driven adventures with a Souls-like flavor sprinkled on top and not the real punishing deal. Mortal Shell, though? This one actually felt like the real thing… but forgiving and beginner-friendly, which was perfect for a newbie like me.

Combat is satisfying but not soul-crushing, “harden” ability is basically a panic button that turns you into a rock (highly relatable), parries and ripostes are satisfying when I don’t completely mess them up, and swapping between four possessed corpses is weirdly fun. Acolyte’s Shell and Smouldering Mace became my comfort picks when I needed to pretend I was good at the game.

Did I git gud? Absolutely not.
Did I feel like I did? Also no.
But now I can smugly say, “Yeah, I beat a Souls-like,” while ignoring the fact that OG Dark Souls and Bloodborne are still lurking in my backlog.

Final Verdict:
If you want to cosplay as a budget Dark Souls player without developing an anger management issue, Mortal Shell is your training wheels.
10/10 would panic-harden again.

So, Mortal Shell is officially the first FromSoft-ish Souls-like I didn’t rage-quit halfway through and uninstall out of pure self-loathing. Progress! 🎉

Look, I’ve tried to join the “Git Gud” cult and be That Guy who flexes about finishing Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Reality check:

Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition prepared me to die - repeatedly.

Bloodborne convinced me I was ready as I smacked the Cleric Beast around and thought, “Wow, maybe I’m good at this!” Enter Father Gascoigne who absolutely wrecked me over and over until I accepted my fate as a casual.

I’ve beaten games that get labeled “Souls-like” - Vampyr, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - but let’s be real, those are more story-driven adventures with a Souls-like flavor sprinkled on top and not the real punishing deal. Mortal Shell, though? This one actually felt like the real thing… but forgiving and beginner-friendly, which was perfect for a newbie like me.

Combat is satisfying but not soul-crushing, “harden” ability is basically a panic button that turns you into a rock (highly relatable), parries and ripostes are satisfying when I don’t completely mess them up, and swapping between four possessed corpses is weirdly fun. Acolyte’s Shell and Smouldering Mace became my comfort picks when I needed to pretend I was good at the game.

Did I git gud? Absolutely not.
Did I feel like I did? Also no.
But now I can smugly say, “Yeah, I beat a Souls-like,” while ignoring the fact that OG Dark Souls and Bloodborne are still lurking in my backlog.

Final Verdict:
If you want to cosplay as a budget Dark Souls player without developing an anger management issue, Mortal Shell is your training wheels.
10/10 would panic-harden again.

There is monetization, and while it isn't very aggressive and you can get most things from just playing the game, it is still a shame that it's there.

What about the team up moves? Amazing.
It can be quite deep going forword with your main character, and even for a Hero Shooter expert as I am ( more than 700 hours of Overwatch 2) the first matches you'll struggle till you learn simple how to move and break the opposite team properly.
And by the way, congrats on the creators by making the game so stable, the connection hasnt been lost EVEN ONCE in all my 25 games.
Hopefully we can become a empathetic and friendly community, for this game to grow on its rooster more than the last Super Smash Bros.
And If you play this game, be good with your team and with each other. We're all here because of each other, and If we can be just CLOSE to a perfect fan base that brings more and more people into the game, maybe in the future we all will main our favorite Marvel character.

This is not just bad. It is insultingly bad. A hero shooter backed by the Marvel brand should have been an easy win. Instead they handed us a half baked rage inducing disaster that plays like it was made by a focus group of clowns in a boardroom who have never touched a game in their lives.

Let’s start with the matchmaking. A manipulative engagement based joke that exists solely to keep you on an emotional yo yo feeding you fake wins before slamming you into matches that make you want to smash your monitor. It is not competitive. It is not skill based. It is engineered misery designed to string you along like some dopamine deprived lab rat.

Balance. Nonexistent. Some characters feel like gods. Others like wet tissue paper. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. There is no middle ground no consistency just chaos. And if you solo queue Congratulations. You have entered matchmaking hell where every match is a gamble between getting brain dead teammates or smurfs playing like they are trying to qualify for the Overwatch League.

The combat Floaty clunky and dull. The abilities lack impact. Gunplay feels like crap. Movement is so stiff you might as well be controlling a brick with wifi lag.

It is painfully obvious the devs did not make this game for players. They made it for metrics. For engagement. For retention charts and cash shop conversions. It is not a game. It is a spreadsheet wrapped in Marvel paint and even that cannot cover the stench.

Marvel Rivals is the worst kind of trash The kind that could have been good. It had everything IP power decent visuals potential gameplay variety and they threw it all in the garbage in favor of cheap manipulative systems and half assed design.

Marvel Rivals is the worst kind of trash The kind that could have been good. It had everything IP power decent visuals potential gameplay variety and they threw it all in the garbage in favor of cheap manipulative systems and half assed design.

I am uninstalling this digital sewage and never looking back. The only rival here is between this game and my gag reflex.LIKED & DISLIKEDAccessibilityArt StyleMore...Jun 25, 202510",Only visible to you,False,N/A,N/A,N/A

The writers of lore seem to be initiates into some mysteries. Even some of the fan base, the way they seem to analyze the goings on in Arkesia and Petrania (The worlds of Lost Ark) seem to be of another class.

From the lore, to the soundtrack to the graphics and character design this game excels.

I can hardly believe i took a break for 3-4 months only to play other popular games. To get disconnected every day, multiple times a day. To experience graphics bugs and glitches, UI bugs and glitches each and every day.But this only helped me to realize how poor alot of these other popular games are and how superior Lost Ark is. In fact, if i can recall, i dont think ive been disconnected once on Lost Ark and i dont think ive ever experienced any bugs or glitches.

There is alot going on in this game, the ways to improve your character and abilities can be overwhelming at times and honing can seem next to impossible, even to finish the main story.

Hace tiempo no veía tanta espera por un juego de rol estilo MMO y gratuito. Este juego publicado por Amazon Games ha llegado a estar en el top 2 de los juegos más concurridos en Steam después de su lanzamiento y eso que llegó al top 5 solo con la beta exclusiva.

En el comienzo podrás elegir a tu clase, cada una con beneficios y contras, también podrás personalizar a tu gusto tu apariencia y darle un nombre. Obviamente cada personaje cuenta con su árbol de habilidad con poderes a desbloquear y mejorar, y ojo que algunas clases tienen subclases las cuales son importantes de estudiar, como por ejemplo, caballero tiene tres subclases las que son: Berserker, Artillero de Lanza y Paladin.

Tenemos varias formas de subir de nivel, pero una de las mejores es seguir las misiones principales, dándole enfoque al lore de todo el universo en el cual estará inserto. Mediante vayas subiendo y ganando más experiencia, se desbloquearan opciones y lugares nuevos por descubrir. Una de las opciones más esperadas es el famoso PvP (Player vs Player), el que pone a la par las estadísticas de los personajes por lo que no importa el nivel sino tu habilidad en combate.

El gameplay es desafiante y a medida que avanzas mejora totalmente, en especial las mazmorras, que para mi son una de las mejores que he jugado.

En conclusión, es un juego que tiene buena personalización de personajes, escenarios increíbles, combate muy fluido y novedoso, un mundo enorme por conocer y mucho contenido a no acabar.

Si son de Latam unanse y jueguen en el servidor AGATON para destruir mazmorras juntos.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,Cropac,"Jugué la primera entrega de Insurgency y me encantó por completo. Sus modos de juego, el ritmo, ese equilibrio entre arcade y realismo me parecieron una experiencia única dentro de los shooters en primera persona. Insurgency: Sandstorm mantiene ese mismo espíritu, pero elevando todo a otro nivel. Gráficamente es muy superior, el sonido es espectacular cada disparo, cada explosión se sienten intensamente reales y la jugabilidad sigue siendo su punto más fuerte.Este no es un shooter para cualquiera. Tiene un enfoque más táctico y realista que Call of Duty, pero no llega a los extremos de simulación de Arma, quedando justo en ese punto medio que lo hace tan especial. Su gunplay es excelente, el arsenal está muy bien trabajado, y los mapas y modos están diseñados para ofrecer combates intensos, inmersivos y llenos de tensión. Si encajas con este estilo de juego, es muy probable que te quedes por decenas o incluso cientos de horas. Y aunque no seas ese jugador “ideal”, Sandstorm sigue ofreciendo razones de sobra para jugarlo, sobre todo si tienes amigos con quienes compartir la **** definitiva, lo recomiendo sin dudar por su jugabilidad, por el realismo bien medido, por sus gráficos mejorados y por su sonido impresionante.

The game gets updates pretty frequently for things like cosmetics, maps, double xp (for account level) it doesn't let the game hang out to dry like what Rockstar games did to Red Dead Redemption 2 MP. The reason i put it as a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is phasing issues when i shoot someone sometimes the bullet goes through them and hits behind them and there's a weird bug recently I've recently got in the pass few days of ground texture being black but it stops when the game is done, none the less if i had 30 bucks and trying to get an fps that will last me a long time, if im looking for a game that isn't COD, Rainbow 6, and im not looking for a game like ready or not/arma/squad, THIS IS THE GAME!!!",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 5, 2025"

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,jdmsjmsrscgm,"Insurgency: Sandstorm,stands out in the crowded field of first-person shooters with its intense and realistic depiction of modern combat. Launched as the sequel to the original Insurgency, Sandstorm enhances the franchise’s reputation for delivering gritty, tactical gameplay that rewards teamwork and strategy over lone-wolf **** of the most notable aspects of Insurgency: Sandstorm is its commitment to realism. The game eschews the more arcade-like elements found in many of its peers in favor of a more grounded approach. Weapons behave realistically, with significant recoil and authentic ballistics. This makes gunfights tense and deadly, where a single bullet can be fatal. The sound design further amplifies the immersion, with gunfire and explosions resonating with a visceral, bone-rattling intensity that places players right in the heart of the **** tactical gameplay is another strong point. Insurgency: Sandstorm requires players to communicate and coordinate effectively to succeed. Each match demands careful planning and precise execution, whether you’re capturing objectives, defending positions, or escorting valuable assets. The game’s various modes, including Push, Firefight, and Checkpoint, offer diverse challenges that test different aspects of tactical proficiency.Visually, Insurgency: Sandstorm may not boast the cutting-edge graphics of some AAA titles, but it compensates with meticulously designed maps that offer a variety of environments, from dense urban centers to sprawling rural landscapes. These maps are not only visually distinct but also intricately designed to support a wide range of tactical approaches.However, Insurgency: Sandstorm is not without its flaws. New players may find the steep learning curve daunting, as the game does little to hold your hand. The realism that hardcore fans love can be a barrier to entry for those accustomed to more forgiving shooters. Additionally, while the game has seen numerous updates and content additions, it still suffers from occasional bugs and performance issues that can detract from the overall experience.Despite these drawbacks, Insurgency: Sandstorm offers a refreshing alternative to more mainstream shooters. Its emphasis on realism and tactical gameplay creates a uniquely intense experience that stands out in the genre. For players who crave a challenging and authentic depiction of modern combat, Insurgency: Sandstorm is a compelling choice that rewards patience, precision, and teamwork.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 7, 2024"

It’s a stuttering, Tearing un optimized mess on day one, a new developer I would give a by ball but this is a 3 year old game and it looks and runs like a PS2 game with the graphics of MGS 1. Lets run down the list of issues this scummy developer thought they would get away with: No Hit Detector, No Kill Detector, A weird marker for friendly’s that appears to the side of them and at some distance from them, a broken comms system where enemy conversations can be heard, screen tearing, lack of any anti-aliasing, Lack of HD graphics, this things running in standard def, lack of textures, broken load out system that fails to remember saved load outs, Lack of progress markers, lack of round information, lack of scoring system, an extremely low draw distance, a gutted game mode system, no vehicles, pop in everywhere, lack of 60fps (in an FPS of all things) a mess of a menu system, a diabolical weapon modification system that remembers nothing, a class system that’s all over the place with standard sniper, heavy, light and assault classes all behind paywalls. And the most important part the bullet physics, I understand the game is built around this but with the exceptionally low graphics there is simply no point to it, I cannot see the drop to correct the shot through the tearing and jaggy choppy gameplay.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,facknrite,"Sooooooooooo after waiting 6 months waiting for an update and optimization for the game, DEV's launched 1.6 test version which includes 1 mediocre map and 2 new guns that have an excesive stupid recoil and added it to the advisor class removing the SVD and EBR MK14 that were the most used guns by players on that class.

They also added the most stupid feature called DEATHCAM which is total trash because now you can see from where you got shot from and all the enemies on that area, meaning that the tactical part of the game is lost.

Once again after hundreds of complaints about that stupid feature they are still going to implement it on the stable version which demonstrate that they don't give a **** about their community feedback and they will still do whatever they want.

So my question is...what is the point of asking feedback when DEV's really don't care about your opinion unless you kiss their a$$es with every stupid decision they make.

Just to make a quick summary of what you will be getting by buying this game is:

- 0 optimization (optimization for this DEV's means, removing stuff from the maps)
- Updates every 6 months which are just gonna be trash.
- Hit Reg issues
- Abandoned Server Owners (Meaning no new cvars, no server side optimization)
- Terrible Hit Reg
- Unknown Performance(The game can run amazingly well on a top tier PC ro it can run like trash on the same PC)
- Fed Up Community (Tired of all the **** of the game and DEV's that got stucked with a facked up game without the option to refund it)

So if you are willing to go through all of that then buy it, if not then save your money and wait for some amazing titles being launched this year.

Risk of Rain 2,632360,8.24,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Indie",Nazrielau05,"I blew 10 hours into Risk of Rain 2. I couldn't get past through Mithrix **** this playthrough made me appreciate this game a whole lot more.

I was never too impressed with the game's presentation. I think i just needed more time to get comfortable with the game's general direction. It's not the most visually interesting game I've played, but at least the character design, enemy designs, level design, and colour grading all comes together to deliver a solid package of a visual style. I want to emphasis on the enemy designs here. Their designs are what sold me to the game's visual direction. The larger creatures has a certain aesthetic to them that compliments the background setting a lot.

I was also mixed on the music for a good while. I don't dislike them or anything, but i think i got very overwhelmed by the game's stimuli. The default settings for this game's audio was really loud and it made me uncomfortable. It's not until i turned down the volume until i could appreciate the game's audio design. The soundtrack elevates the hectic and chaotic battle sequences at least 10 times. Of course, this is only possible if the sound effects were good in the first place, and they are! the sound designs has so much weight to it. It really sells you the scale of the larger enemies in the game. Sound clues are also very effective here. A lot of sounds are exclusive to a certain type of threat. So a headphone/earphone is recommended to get the full experience.

This game's mechanics is the spotlight here. Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D Third person shooter game, and it uses that concept until the point of exhaustion. It's a philosophy that's very integral for any type of Art. You thought of a concept? use it over and over again until you couldn't think of anything more. Some of the most memorable enemies for me are the airborn ones! That's a serious feat in my opinion. And some of the on-ground enemies could jump/float! just to mess with your sense of vision. This game's battle sequences are extremely hectic and chaotic. This experience is probably what made me uncomfortable about the game for a good while. So many things could happen in a blink of an eye! the stimuli is insane.

Another thing about RoR 2's mechanics I've seen being brought up by the community is the Rogue-like implementation. Other Rogue-like video games won't allow you to have too many abilities in a single run, just because they don't want you to be too powerful. Like Hades, Inscryption, and Buckshot Roulette, just to name a few. Risk of Rain 2 is perfectly fine with you stacking up so many insane power ups on top of the external helps (Drones, Turrets, Guardians etc.). RoR 2 allows the player to feel like an absolute monster. How did the game balance this mechanic? The final boss could steal your items and abilities. You get them back by dealing damage at the bastard. Insane video game. The game's battle system oozes so much polish and care behind it. I couldn't help but feel inclined to boot up RoR 2 day after day just to experience it again. Risk of Rain 2 is a very fresh experience in the Rogue-like space. Not necessarily the absolute king of the genre, but a unique exprience nonetheless.

Las razones hablaré de ellas ahora, pero quiero que quede claro que lo jugué en solitario, con lo que probablemente las sensaciones y eso para quienes lo jueguen en multiplayer con amigos (como está diseñado) sean mejores. Si resumimos mucho, el juego es un shooter rogue-like, con mogollón de enemigos, cada vez más y más duros, en lo que explorar zonas para conseguir mejoras aleatorias y desbloquear el teleportador previa batalla contra el boss. El problema es que se hace muy repetitivo porque le faltan cosas típicas de los roguelike. Una de esas cosas es que los mapas aquí son fijos (con variaciones menores como zonas pequeñas que pueden estar accesibles o no), con lo cual se acaba conociendo los mismos demasiado, si además tenemos en cuenta que los primeros los ves todo el rato, se acaba haciendo muy repetitivo. Luego le falta una historia así como un sistema de progresión de cualquier clase que otorgue objetivos o razones para jugar, pero en este caso cada intento es completamente independiente. El único cambio que queda de una partida a otra es lo que vas desbloqueando, que se hace en base a conseguir logros, algunos de los cuales ocurrirán simplemente por ir jugando, pero la mayoría acaban dependiendo del azar de que te caigan los bonos adecuados, de que una habilidad ocurra de cierto modo, etc. lo cual acaba siendo muy frustrante. Igual que lo es el hecho de que, llegado cierto punto y con una build decente, al final el juego se resume en ""te vas cargando todo sin que te hagan nada hasta que llegas al lugar equivocado y sin que puedas evitarlo, de una hostia te bajan entero"". Gráficamente el juego tiene una estética muy suya pero personalmente no me ha gustado nada,  y tiene además ciertos problemas de legibilidad en la distancia (como que los cadáveres de ciertos enemigos parecen cofres). La música ahí ya es cosa de gustos, para mi es demasiado electrónica noventera, que es un género que no me convence, pero ahí habrá a quien si le parezca perfecta y sin duda, no puedo decir que sea mala pese a que no encaje en mis gustos. No hay voces como tales, los efectos de sonido son muy básicos. Y el juego tiene ciertos bugs ocasionales como cosas que spawnean dentro de paredes, una baja IA de enemigos y aliados, **** todo ello, Risk of Rain no me parece un juego terrible, pero tampoco gran cosa.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",Cthulhu5000,"This review is based on experience playing RS2:V after EGA giveaway. If you grab game for free this might help you decide is it worth actually downloading.

It's my first realistic MMOFPS, I enjoyed it so much at first, I'd made a little research through guides and game history, and now ready to present my opinion.

IF IT WAS 2017, I'D RATE GAME 8 OR 9 OUT OF 10. BUT THERE ARE TO MANY ""BUTS"" NOW. As you could've guessed, FOR SHORT VERSION READ ONLY CAPS from now on.

GAME IS BASICALLY ABANDONED BY DEVELOPERS. That's it. It was free giveaway because company no longer interested in the game. Original developer team is long gone and had to be recontacted to do EGS-transfer and troubleshooting.
There is stuff just cut out from the game. It's three maps and M16A2. Game realistically doesn't have over 9000 guns, so it's really important. There are some balancing issues never to be resolved (Long Tan map for example). No event support at all (like Halloween). Graphics are just bad. No bulletholes on surfaces, you can't zero your gun properly while training. No internal guides, just two training areas, one of which being actual map, no ability to train with bots there. There are nasty bugs, I'd seen on 2017 videos and even 2015 CBT footages. Going prone and standing up can result in your legs being under the ground and you will limp excessively. In this condition, moving prone is the fastest way. If your helicopter crashed, you survived and some ally is near by, it mostly results in autokick from server for excessive team damage. There are of course some smaller bugs, but these two are the biggest pain.

CONTENT CREATORS ARE GONE. Basically no channels. Old guides with obsolete information. Placeholders, work-in-proogress, no longer supported everywhere.

PING IS HELL. Don't believe ping value of server in search. Multiply by at least 3, be ready for x4, expect x5. And magically 20 ping becomes 100. Sometimes, when we're losing, I check ping values of players. Losing team has higher values.

TO GET FULL GAME PAY EXTRA ~50$ MONTHLY. There are 2 types of servers. Official and private. Private costs money. You can't just create a room with setting, no-no, pay to third party. Official servers have some of only two game modes: Territory (capture the objective) and Supremacy (capture and hold for points). If you want to play Skirmish (team deathmatch), Campaign (consequent battles with its own rules) or Green Army Man DLC as Free Grunt (Territory and Supremacy) you have two options: go for someone's server hope for the best (ping, rules, community, quantity of players) or buy one for yourself and hope for the same best. Same applies for different settings (called mutators), like visibility of allied troops marks, making game more realistic.

GAMING COMMUNITY ****.
You get new players, that don't want to learn, grab most important classes, and try to play RS2V as generic MMOFPS, aiming for good K/D ratio, that they will never get, and not playing the objective.
On the other hand you have salty people that send anyone to training areas to learn to fly, for example. Well, it's really easy with 0 ms ping and when no one is firing at you.
Again, on some other hand you have kickers. They want your class just because. Or don't like you. Most notorious one changed team and kicked me. Why others agreed? I suppose, they thought ""if votekick is going, it's definitely for a reason"". So, I ask you, if you'll play, never votekick if you don't know the crime.
Just bad commanders.
Radiomen not sticking to commander and actually picking up this class just because it's a class. They don't even use the smokes.

Combat, gameplay, pace, maps, guns, sound, and Community are awsome.

Servers, Graphics, and animation ****!

Gameplay-
Its just divine, you feel like you are really in the war, and you can't just run for the objective, you need to be careful, cooperate with your teammates.
The shots feel real, and every decision you make will have an impact (good or bad).
The community always tries to help and is respectful.

Now the bad points:

Graphics and animations-
They look kinda bad and outdated, even for a 2017 game, I mean, its unreal engine 3 and there are a lot of visual bugs.

Servers-
Now, this is THE big problem:
The worst servers I've seen in my entire life (including MW)... The game is free right now, and 20k people are playing the game, but it cant handle such amount of people! my question is: if they cant handle 20k players, why is it free? I mean, it is just a dumb move, and no one will want to return to the game, and it will die AGAIN...
I can't find servers and the servers that are not full have 200 ping.
Everyone complaining about how poorly made the game is...

Although it is a banal shooting range for speed,
But, the music makes this experience unforgettable and infinitely replayable, I respect the composer, this ""inducing"" motive, which, after passing the middle of the game, becomes generally mad - it's incredible.
The plot here, most likely, is about a drug addict who is trying not to die and get out of the ""binge"", and, of course, there is not enough full-fledged story up to 10/10, but you can imagine any story convenient for you in your head, where the main character needs to run until the end and not die. Another flaw of the game for me is not very well-developed shooting, I completed game with a shotgun, it's much easier, but the ""aim-challenge"" is losted.
Well, I can also say that sometimes quite beautiful locations are generated, all the sounds are of high quality.
And yet, the game is quite easy, in fact, it takes 4-7 hours to complete, even if you don’t know how to shoot (again, shotgun helps you), lacks some kind of hardcore mode, but it would be even better to get the second part)

Это игра - настоящее произведение искусства!
Хоть и представляет из себя банальный тир на скорость,
Но, музыка делает этот экспериенс незабываемым и бесконечно реиграбельным, композитору моё почтение, вот этот ""нагнетающий"" мотив, который после прохождения середины игры становится вообще бешенным - это невероятно.
Сюжет тут, скорее всего, про наркомана, который пытается не умереть и выбраться из ""запоя"", и, полноценной истории до 10/10, конечно, не хватает, но вы можете представлять в голове любую удобную вам историю, где главному герою надо добежать до конца и не умереть. Ещё один недостаток игры для меня в не очень проработанной стрельбе, я проходил только с дробашом, так гораздо легче, но ""аим-челлендж"" теряется.
Ну а так, ещё могу сказать, что иногда генерируются довольно красивые локации, все звуки качественные.
И ещё, игра достаточно лёгкая, на самом деле, проходится за 4-7 часов, даже если вы не умеете стрелять (опять же, шотган в помощь), не хватает какого-то хардкор режима, а лучше было бы вообще получить вторую часть)",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 3, 2022"

Might just be an example of too much being a bad thing, but by the time I hit ep3 I was kinda over it. Levels are all a bit long and my god these final boss fights are rough, with punishing lack of checkpoints etc. Still I'd say the fights are fun as hell, with all the movement tech the game provides coupled with furious guns blazing. Worth a play. Just be prepared to wonder how long the ride is going to last.

Dusk,1100600,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Sports",Zski,"This is a game that has to be played to understand why the reviews are so high. I watched videos and thought it looked neat, but it wasn’t really pulling me in. It sat in my library for over a year, and within 5 minutes of experiencing it, I understood. A couple days later, I finished the game, and what a wonderful treat for people who grew up with the original Quake. This game seriously captures the same energy of Quake without making the formula feel in any way dated. The gameplay is very simple, but it’s a nice refreshing throwback to when games required the fast paced run and gun movement rather than relying on cover. Where I think the game really shines is the atmosphere - who would have ever thought that this game with its intentionally retro graphics and play style would have a creepier atmosphere than many modern horror games. The initial part of the game gave me the atmospheric feeling of Resident Evil 4, except better. Some of the later sections of the game are truly unsettling. Between the beautiful yet extremely simple graphics and the phenomenal sound design, it helps tell the story of the game without the game actually having much of an overt story at all. Everything is told through the atmosphere and level design. It was actually pretty fun guessing what was going on and trying to create a story for yourself, since there is hardly any written or spoken dialogue. The sound design in this game is fantastic, a master in its class and it outsides most major modern horror games - especially some of the settings in the later portions of the game. It’s a pretty challenging game, but its highly rewarding. While it got frustrating at times, the satisfaction of pushing through a level and completing it after multiple tries was something I rarely experience in games anymore. The only flaw I would say is regarding some of the level design, which is true to the classic genre, but it didn’t age the best. I found myself lost pretty regularly because a lot of the textures and buildings look the same. Sometimes it allowed for some fun exploration, other times I was just running around for several minutes unable to figure out where I last saw something. There are a few really dark levels that were particularly irritating because of how difficult it was to find your way around.

Anger Foot,2198510,29.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",CrackDiet,"Overall a very fun, unique and interesting experience. The world of S#*t city is pungent, and fits exceptionally well with its art style (both in game and within the intro cutscene and accompanying art), atmosphere, tone and, best of all, the soundtrack. 
Gameplay is engaging. As you progress and complete challenges within missions, you acquire a new pair of trainers which give you modifiers which range from a second life, explosions when you kick doors, giving enemies big heads, etc. It bodes well for replayability. The game at its core isn’t so challenging, but when going for the challenge stars, it makes the game a lot more difficult. 

The thing I like the most about this game is the artstyle, music, atmosphere and setting, I think it all fits together exceptionally well, and gives a breath of fresh air to the genre. A unique experience, and something that will stay in my mind for a while.

Anger Foot,2198510,29.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",CthlhuCory,This game reminds me a lot of the Ghostrunner series where it's definitely a first person shooter/melee game but it's less about just shooting your way through levels and more about being precise. Feels more like a puzzle game to an extent than just a straightforward shooter. Definitely a game where it's all about trial and error and you will absolutely have to play a level multiple times to get your run down perfect. A little frustrating because of this and because it feels like a grind and I constantly feel like even if I am doing well I could get killed going through a new doorway and have to restart the whole level all over again. The music is great and it is kind of a ridiculous concept of the world run by gangs and you being the one guy who's not in a gang. Gameplay is super solid though which is bringing me back into it for sure. The random driving mechanics they threw in to the last two levels of the game totally threw me off and they were not intuitively controlled at all and that dropped the score for me because a solid shooter became a janky Drive Fest in the very last stretch of the game.,True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 5, 2025"

There are 5 areas that must be passed on the **** City Map to complete this game, including: The Violence Gang (15 Stage + Boss), The Pollution Gang (13 Stage + Boss), The Business Gang (15 Stage + Boss), The Debauchery Gang (13 Stages + Boss), Crime Tower (4 Stages + Boss).

The Crime Minister. There are 2 endings in this game, namely Bad and True Ending.

Better movement, gameplay and control that most of the Doom/Quake-like out there. 
The music its great, like in Hotline, without the music this game wouldn`t be half of what it is.
Good art style, coherent with its setting and story. 
Can replay the levels multiples times to get all stars and not feel discouraged in failure. However, once completed in full, there`s nothing that makes you try again. What`s the problem about this? The game is short already, and the full levels don`t add much time of play to the pool.

Идея того, что время движется только тогда, когда двигаешься ты, заставляет продумывать каждый шаг и делает игру похожей на своеобразную стратегию в реальном времени. Атмосфера минимализма и яркий визуальный стиль тоже играют свою роль: красные враги на фоне белого окружения смотрятся стильно и придают всему происходящему особый шарм.Но, несмотря на оригинальность, есть моменты, которые могут надоесть. Кампания довольно короткая, а после прохождения основного сюжета остается не так много причин возвращаться. Кроме того, сама концепция замедления времени интересна, но в какой-то момент она перестает быть чем-то необычным и превращается в рутину.В итоге Superhot — это отличная игра для пары вечеров, но ее идеи не раскрываются в полной мере.

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",Highwayy,"Legends of Runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. Most importantly, LoR innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like Hearthstone). With most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. The artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like League of Legends and Arcane. The game offers an incredible and near-endless PvE experience in addition to PvP: in fact, PvP has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. The future is difficult to predict and I hope that PvP will grow more as my heart will always be in PvP gameplay. Perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for PvP.

Today I played lor, I played LAB mode. A mode that fights with Ai with characters like Yasuo Jinx Jayce to choose from. I have played Yasuo until Victor. Before reaching the Viktor stage, I had to pass a level where it was random, every turret Round start.
I'm going to tell you that **** is so unbalanced I'm stuck at level 3 4 times and still haven't passed.
I think what
1. Unbalanced is a card that Ai randomly gets and still gets a Key word. Key word is this. It pisses me off a lot. I randomly hit through and the one that hit through is a T-Rex 8/8.
2. The card I have The gad I randomly picked up some important characters.
2.1 Cleared the whole board (this one I'm okay with) but what's not okay is when the main character is dead What character? to defeat the T-rex 8/8 Overwhelm.

2.2 Random Gards Gards that can make me play easier won't say. For example, if I do a Yasuo + Yone combo, these gards won't come out.

End. I'm dizzy. I'm totally out of mood playing this LAB. I wasted 1 to 2 hours.

F2P friendly, nice Graphics/Artwork and regual new content makes it fun for a game now and then.

The biggest let down for me are Bugs, Metaplay and communication.
Bugs appear on a dayli base and range from grafics glitches into others to cards wont work or you cant place them (even though i encountered gamebreaking bugs very rarely).
Bugs stay in the game for very long until they get fixed e.g. Shurima came out 8 Months ago and Azirs voice lane is still cut during the lvl up animation.

Communication means, i have the feeling they only hear positiv feedback and ignore negativ feedback/player suggestions, one reason i post my critic here.
Imo the Report Side is not comfortable (i was not able to use it for a long time) and i dont like the big chatroom on discord, i feel ignored.

There are a lot builds you can play but only for the Memes, not for winning. In ranked, you can see only flavor of the month, the Metagame is very strong in this one.
Off-Meta builds are really not fun to play and the few Meta Builds change on every patch.
Power Creep is a huge problem in LoR, every patch, the new Cards are way more powerfull then the ""older ones"", either by having way better Stats/cost ratio or have the same stats but really good keywords.
The game makes no secret that it has its focus on fast games, thats why rush decks are Meta and lategame or control decks feel useless. E.g. Seamonsters needs you to throw 25 of your 40 cards away ,literally(!), to have theyr keyword work.
The only reason i do sometimes recommend it to some die hard League fans is its because its F2P.

Instead I got huuuge disappointment and wasted dozens of euros. I got a game with falsely described genre, a game with shallow characters, a game which is now a new king of running simulators, as there is literally nothing else to do, you just run, and then you fight, and then run again, and fight, and run, and fight, .... I was told it was great turn-based game with real-time mechanics, instead I got QTE game, but with control over up to 3 characters (so I did QTE in turns for them). Combat is also extremely unbalanced, as literally just parrying can win every single fight in this game, while missing a dodge or parry in later stages of the game means instant fail, team death and reset from last save. This is tied to abilities and perk-buy management. There are multiple distinct abilities (at least the text is different), however because of the lack of game balance I mentioned previously, it actually does not matter what abilities does player pick, as dodging or parrying perfectly is the only singular requirement to win every single fight in the entire game without any exceptions. Adding to that, this results in excesive repetitivness of gameplay. Next up, I was expecting bit of a roleplaying (that is this ""RP"" in RPG), but I got no dialogues at all while playing the game (except for the camp, there I was able to read few lines of dialogues, and except for cutscenes, obviously). Many praised this game for story, but somehow I got another cheap premise with rushed second half of the story. The idea was good though, just the execution was simply bad. Nonchalant ""cute"" cutscenes did not fit the narrative and were breaking the ""immersion"" for me, although immersion is veeeery strong word to use here, as this game does not deliver immersion of any kind. The same goes for OST, which was quite good, however some anime-like combat bangers absolutely did not fit the atmosphere at all. Last but not least I will mention the visuals, which are as good as in any UE5 game, so nothing special there, but nothing to complain about either, except for two things - 1) developers tried to make every environment special, unique and distinct, but the result is quite the opposite as all the locations feel simmilar in every way except for colours used in them; and 2) glitches were EVERYWHERE.

In conclusion, the hype around this game is as artificial as it gets, driven by ""30 devs"" story, which is also not true. This game has nothing much to offer for people with some standards. If you like empty corridors, endless running and QTE, this is a game for you. Objectively, if this was not advertised as ""game of the generation"" I would give this game like 4/10, however, I expected 100x more from advertised ""masterpiece"" and ended up deeply disappinted, like I probably never was before.",False,N/A,N/A,"Nov 10, 2025"

Disco Elysium,632470,9.99,0,solo,RPG,razzzor,"Are all the critics on a rush of putting anything intellectual and different as game of the year? I just got done playing Journey (late on the PC) and was just as puzzled as to how that was game of the year.This is standard point-and-click adventure gaming, absolutely nothing ground-breaking apart from just good writing. If you like that sort of thing and love reading books of that style, you'll enjoy it I suppose.

The only difference is it's much longer than your standard adventure game, more depth in the skills and the dialogue just goes on and on. Half a million lines they say? Do I really want to read all that? Much of it is just pointless dribble. You have all these inside voices that speak, but it's not really that interesting. The most interesting dialogue in the whole game was the humour from the two kids near the start and the ringing the police station.

The art/design is all beautiful. But it's still stuck in an overhead isometric camera view. For sure if they had a AAA budget they would do a third-person mouse look, that's far more immersive. Can you imagine watching a movie, or even a 20 hour TV series, where its just this one view above their heads? It would be laughed at. But somehow, 40 years since the start of the isometric point and click, we're still stuck on this low budget camera angle. You never see the characters faces. Even in the small picture frame you get of the characters, which often barely resemble the model on-screen, it's just a static picture. The main character never even has a voice, and your sidekick is deadpan in everything he says. This is lacking in any expression or emotion. When you only have the budget to do a single isometic angle, this simply can't be a 9+/10. You'll also have to fight through sluggish movement, constantly bumping into invisible walls absolutely everywhere trying to work out the small path to walk. I even had a few game ending bugs that I had to reload from.

The overall gameplay revolves around slowly walking back and forth for hours clicking things until something happens in the game, because it's often unclear what you're supposed to do so you just have to click everything, exhaust every dialogue tree, until one of the many missions you have resolves something so you can continue. You'll get a dialogue dead-end where you don't have the skills or research necessary to continue, so you do random tasks to unlock it, or reload the game over and over until you pass the check my chance. I also didn't load a lot into the skills because it's so unclear what's really going to help, as well as how many skill points you have. So I just left it until the end game to when I thought I would need them, but I still didn't. I'd probably only used 5 skills points throughout the game.

The skill sets and requiring certain skills, items and tasks to be completed to unlock dialogue is still a nice idea overall and I'm not sure how you could tweak it to make it better. But a 9/10, nope.

What was good about most of the game was the story, which had me continuing to play it to see how in unravelled. But in the end, without spoilers, the conclusion really had absolutely nothing to do with anything up till that point and just felt like the writer didn't have any idea how to finish it so just threw something in there to wrap things up. A major disappointment.

This is a nice simple point and click adventure, but it goes on for far too long. Over 20 hours I spent on it and was ready for it to be over before then. The highlights for me are just seeing a nice new area of the map. It's not the mountains of dialogue, the story that was never properly concluded, or the very basic puzzle solving. But I can see much better looking design in a full 3D game and countless adventure games already look this beautiful.

I'd give it a 7/10. I think the critics have just forgotten what normal adventure games are like and got all hung  up on intellectual dialogue and skill trees.",True,N/A,N/A,"May 1, 2025"

Disco Elysium,632470,9.99,0,solo,RPG,PenetratorGod,"I played the game and it was definitely one of the worst and boring games I've ever seen and I deleted it. It's not a game, it's more like an e-book.

First of all, this is not an open world game. I have no idea how it can be marketed like this, have the makers ever seen an open world game? The NPCs do nothing but sleep at night and the world is a small and frankly empty map. It's static and dead and never changes. It's not even a world, let alone an open world.

It's not a real RPG either. Yes, you have stats and inventory and dice rolls, but that's it. Also, these are just game mechanics, there's a skill tree and inventory like in a lot of games, but they don't make a game an RPG game, and there's no real choice, because the whole difference is tied to dialog options, which you'll click on anyway, further destroying the role-playing part, and for a lot of things, choosing to do something will actually be a dice roll, and the mechanics of retrying the roll are overly complicated and too overwhelming to take the time.

No matter what you do, you'll be dragged towards a single ending, which makes sense since it's a murder mystery, but as a player you have no choice, the only real choice is at the character creation screen, and from that point on it's pretty much set how you're going to play the next 30-40 hours of the game, which is filled with dialog just to drag it out.

Yes, you can click on options in dialog windows, but the game will decide for you whether that happens or not, and it will mostly depend on your character's stats and some modifiers. Yes, again, it's an RPG mechanic, but as a player, you don't really get to choose anything or do anything.

An example **** where your choices really matter would be Detroit Become Human. Or even Witcher 3. Disco Elysium is nowhere near that level, Detroit is already not an RPG game, Witcher 3 is not a pure RPG, but supposedly Disco Elysium was marketed as open world and a pure RPG, but it's not even half as successful as those games.

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",Kai82,One on hand an incredibly good old school turn based RPG and on the other they use a lot of design choices I dislike. It is inspired by old RPGs like Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross. You can play as Valere or Zale who are Solstice Warriors. If you are born on summer or winter solstice you are special and can unlock sun or moon magic. Back in the past an evil alchemist named the Fleshmancer developed near godlike powers and nearly destroyed the world. His creations the Dwellers still exist and are only vulnerable on Eclipses to sun and moon magic. The story starts with Zale and Valeres training to become Solstice warriors and evolves to a fight to the fate of the world. The story and characters are superb. I felt the emotions and impacts the character face. I struggled with them and it was an intense feeling. The story evolves and has many surprises and turns. I think it is some of the best stuff in years. The gameplay is a bit mixed. I feel bad for mentioning it as it could just be not my taste. The turn base battles have a gimmick. Special attacks by the enemies can be nullified. Locks are displayed when an enemy cast a special attack. For example a moon and sword symbol. If you attack with a moon and sword attack (or both) before the counter reaches zero the attack is nullified. Normal attacks create mana orbs which can be used to power up your actions. Each character has his/her unique elements and used mana orbs are converted to their mana types.  Now to the choices I dislike. Your level ups are rare and give not much stat wise. You are give a choice to boost some stats on each level up but that makes not much difference. At the time I was in the final dungeon I was just on level 23 with a lot of grinding. They also don't want you to power level. The experience points from battle decrease on each level up. Also the true ending requires a lot of effort that feels like a chore. Here I had a bug that prevents me from getting it. Luckily there is YouTube. Finally the resource management is a bit of a chore too. You can switch to auto heal after each battle which gives a total different gaming experience. If not you have a boring cycle of collecting food and cooking to replenish health. Sadly you have a very limited storage for cooked items. The Wheels mini game is really nice and I enjoyed it. The presentation is superb. The graphics look really great and the soundtrack is memorable. Overall I ended up enjoying the game even with its flaws. I give an 8/10 because lower or higher feels wrong for me.,True,N/A,N/A,"Aug 24, 2025"

Don't expect Chrono Trigger or FF6 quality, as this game suffers from very simplistic and overly shallow writing. Story telling is quite weak as this is the developer's first RPG game. Combat is decent and does keep me interested. 
Ending is not really satisfying, which bums me after spending 40 hours playing the game. The ""real"" ending is locked behind some frustrating requirement, so most players wont get to see it.

In the beginning, it seems to do everything right: the characters seem good, the plot is interesting, the world feels alive, and the fights are engaging. But most of that fades way too fast.
While the story stays compelling for a while, the first cracks in the characters appear pretty soon. And even though you can forgive some blunders, they accumulate, and by the time you get to the middle of the story, they are all but falling apart. 
That is also the point where I noticed that I don’t care for the story anymore. It wasn’t that great before, but it became bad afterwards.Sadly, even the fights are way too monotonous, with each character having basically the same moves throughout the game.

Crusader Kings III,1158310,49.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"RPG, Simulation, Strategy",nbdiden,"Crusader Kings III remains the crown jewel of character-driven grand strategy: a sprawling medieval soap opera where secrets, stress, hooks, and schemes make people—not provinces—the real battlefield. Five years on, a steady cadence of expansions and free patches has turned a strong launch into a remarkably rich sandbox. Royal Court introduced artifacts, court grandeur, and a deep culture rework with traditions and hybridization. Tours & Tournaments overhauled activities and travel so your ruler actually roams the map to host tournaments, weddings, and realm tours that blend story and statecraft. Legends of the Dead added prestige-building legends and frightening, map-wide epidemics that finally put mid-to-late-game comfort at risk. Roads to Power revitalized the Byzantine experience, layered in administrative government and family estates, and even let you play as a landless adventurer. 2025’s Khans of the Steppe brought a sharper nomadic identity and seasonal pressures to the steppes, while the small Coronations pack turns being crowned into a dramatic, choice-filled ceremony. With All Under Heaven on the horizon expanding the map into East Asia, CK3 continues to widen its **** result is a game that excels as a story engine first and a map painter second. Cultures feel alive rather than static tech trees, court identity gives you long-term goals, and activities pull you out of menus and into your realm’s politics. New playstyles—from imperial intrigue to nomadic ambition—keep campaigns fresh, and the mod scene supercharges longevity with total conversions and quality-of-life tools. That said, warfare and economy remain intentionally broad-brush, which may disappoint players chasing crunchy tactical depth or intricate economic loops. Very large realms can still snowball into stability unless you lean on game rules or self-imposed challenges, and each big chapter tends to arrive with balance bumps that need hotfixes. The DLC web is real, too: while major patches are generous, the “full modern CK3” experience is spread across multiple add-ons. On platforms, PC is definitive thanks to mods, but the PS5 and Xbox versions have matured into genuinely comfortable ways to play, even without mod support.Verdict: Crusader Kings III is still the most entertaining medieval drama generator you can buy. With its expanding cast of systems and consistently surprising emergent narratives, it turns dynastic pettiness into grand history better than anything else out there. Expect occasional rough edges and a growing DLC bill, but the core magic remains unmatched. Score: 9/10.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 4, 2025"

Managing your house, navigating tricky diplomatic decisions, and reacting to emergent story events make for an extremely immersive medieval experience for fans of the genre.However, a significant drawback is the absence of an official Italian localization. The volume of text is huge—beyond menus and mechanical descriptions, there are intrigues, legends, dynastic stories, and historical details that deserve to be read calmly and thoroughly. For many non-English speakers, this represents a real barrier that can discourage newcomers or prevent them from catching every narrative and gameplay **** Italian community has stepped in with fan-made translation mods on Steam Workshop or Paradox Mods—often updated with care and covering a very high percentage of strings. These “do-it-yourself” solutions greatly improve accessibility but have two main limits: they require manual updates after each patch or DLC, and even when done well, occasional translation inconsistencies or unlocalized strings can slip through, disrupting the **** a text-heavy, narrative-rich game like this, an official translation would ensure consistency and completeness, avoiding the frustration of missing strings or mod incompatibilities. It would also signal that Paradox Interactive values the Italian market, helping grow the player base by making the game more approachable for those less comfortable in English or who simply prefer playing in their native language.Setting aside this issue, the gameplay itself remains outstanding: the interface is polished, the tutorial helps you start but mastering the complex mechanics still takes time, and multiplayer offers compelling challenges with friends. The historical depth and freedom to craft unique stories make Crusader Kings III one of the best titles in its genre, despite the steep learning **** summary, I give it 8/10 because at its core the game is excellent and deeply satisfying for grand strategy enthusiasts, but the lack of an official Italian localization significantly reduces accessibility for many players. Fan translations are a great resource, but they can’t replace a professional localization effort: if Paradox released official Italian support, I would raise this score.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 17, 2025"

* Too much focus on RPG part of the game (frequent random events that get repetitive/annoying very quickly) instead of the mechanics. Many parts of the game could use new/deeper mechanics (HRE, papacy, crusades, diplomacy, republics etc.). Unfortunately the DLC seems to focus on even more RPG events instead of core game mechanics.

* Game too easy overall. Limitless aggressive expansion is possible. Intrigue is too powerful.

* Bad UI, even by Paradox standards. The new map lacks many important viewmodes that were essential in CK2, and requires you to zoom in/out constantly to finally fade in the content you need (armies, counties etc. - but at the same time you get useless terrain features, snow effects etc.). This requires constant use of the mouse wheel, which makes for very poor ergonomics.

The first half of the game was super interesting, fun and exciting, although often not easy to figure out what to do.

From about halfway through, however, this gets out of hand. 
You have no plan where to go, what to do, or why to do anything.
The puzzles, which are logical and fun at the beginning, become too frequent and illogical over time, making them frustrating.

The game relies too much on its scripted events.
If you haven't done A exactly as planned, you'll find yourself standing in front of closed doors at B.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",TemplarGR,"Terribly overrated game. Let me tell you something kids, as a hardcore RPG veteran with decades of experience: Just because you are starved for a new RPG, doesn't mean that every piece of garbage that arrives at the stores and has character stats is worth it. Back in the day, we experienced a similar RPG drought, which ended with Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, and Final Fantasy VII. See? We celebrated with real classics, not this overrated garbage.

This game is huge, but only because it is tedius. You will go pixel hunting like a mad man for no reason. It is filled with containers that have nothing inside. It has plenty of mechanics and stats to master but once you finally understand the system it lacks serious depth. The turn based combat is slow, boring, and has no reason to be turn based. The story is meh. The dialogs are cringe-worthy. Decent graphics and voice acting, and after patches is at a very good shape, but this is not enough.

It will demand a lot of time and patience from you, but it won't satisfy you. It doesn't really deliver as an RPG. Those who compare this to the classics like Baldur's gate, are out of their minds and i am fairly certain they have never played it.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Voyou,"Looking for a real RPG (as opposed to a Hack n' Slash or a platformer with skills tree), I start DOS, and immediately notice I'm in amateur territory: barely readable fonts, and no way to increase them. If you asked me 30 years ago, I would have guessed that the bigger our monitors would become, the better we could read. How it came to the exact opposite is obviously due to a conspiracy of ophthalmologists bribing game developers. Anyway, barely, but still readable, so I keep going. Instead of resting my eyes 15 minutes per hour, I'll just have to swap and actually play 15 minutes per hour.

Character creation time. A very exciting step in an RPG for sure, and usually a long one. Here, we start with a surprising surprise: we create 2 characters. Hmm... I'm a bit confused. I like talking at the singular 1st person about myself, and my avatar. That's what happens when a player feels invested in a game, and that's a plus for said game. So, will I have to use the plural, like the famous British tapeworm, Queen Victoria ? We want to be amused, and we are all for experiments, even doomed ones, so we keep going.

Characters creation was actually very quick, and very underwhelming. A few skills, some of them opening a talent pseudo-menu (pseudo because it offers actually no choices,) and we are done. Also, there are only 2 races: male and female. Err... I meant... only 2 species: bodybuilder and barbie doll. Anyway, you get our meaning. I mean, my meaning.

I both hop on a beach (confusing, isn't it ?) It's a pretty 3d world, not gorgeous like these 2d painted games, but it will do nicely. Someone is talking near the west edge, but stays invisible. These long range constant chatters will prove very annoying in the future, specially in town. They'll make you want to go away instead of doing what you plan on doing.

And then, the pixel hunting starts. Pixel hunting is the meat of this game. In the following hours, I will have hovered over, then opened, hundreds of crates and vases. Most of them empty, yet my dreadfully cumbersome inventory screen will look like a huge pile of junk. And that will be enough for me to quit and have no desire to come back. I feel like I've been playing a hack n' slash without the hack. And, mostly, pixel hunting. In 2015.

Sure, a few nice things happened in the mean time: playing mostly a thief, I discovered an amusing take on the sneaking trope, and a challenging and interesting pickpocket mechanism. I got involved in a couple of fights, and backstabbing proved satisfying at this early stage. Using magic scrolls also proved very helpful, unlike in any other game (I usually can't be bothered, but here it felt natural.) And that's about it.

It's an RPG, so there are dialogues and interactions and story lines and stuff, but one word is enough to summarise them: childish.

I really liked Harry Potter as a kid, read the books since goblet of fire as they were launched, good times... 
That automatically makes us like the game, although I feel there were lots of missed opportunities here.

The main story and quest line is great. Kudos for that. The rest, however, leaves it to be an average game. 

Main issues, in my view: 
#1 Side quests, although are not repetitive per se, gave me no incentive to me for doing that (with some exceptions in the beginning for spells etc.). 
#2 That is also linked to a mediocre item mechanics. You get better items, you upgrade with same materials, breed pets, that's it. After some time it's all legendary items. Also always same price in shops. No sets, only traits for gameplay styles. Could be a lot better.
#3 Natty side quests seemed empty. Game would be better without it and I can see why people complain and even say this was a ESG filler. That does not bother me, but the character is annoying and quests are bad
#4 Alohomora mechanics is a pain in the... really whoever was the game designer responsible for this did a terrible job. Not only boring, but annoying. Also the demiguises statues. I just found myself at the end of the game with level 1 alohomora and need to spend now 1 hour I guess to get the statues to finish the rest that I was locked out. What a pain. This alone to me warrants one star less. No wonder one of the main mods is to remove this
#5 the ""mini bosses"" or ""infamous foes"" could be a lot lot better. No development around them, instant petrific totalus on them. 
== All in all, this is a great Harry Potter game. But that's it. Remove the Harry Potter world and this would be an average skippable 6 or 7 game.

It had some features that were cool to have and others that just fell flat. I think the attention to detail with the world was really cool as it felt you were truly in the movies. I think the story was also really good and engaging. It also was a nice touch with how your decisions can change your ending. 
My biggest regret was buying the deluxe edition as I mainly bought it for the Thestral mount but by the time you finally unlock mounts you will already have your broomstick lvl 2 or 3 and it will be faster to use and easier to control. I also liked how we got our own customizable rooms to use but after unlocking it and customizing the room after the tutorial I never went back besides when new sections got added.

Lo he abandonado porque tras tantas horas de juego, este no remonta. Si buscas un juego precioso estéticamente, pero hueco en su interior, este es ideal. Recuerdo pocos juegos como este, es como hablar con un maniquí, muy bonito de fuera, bien vestido, pero no responde ni tiene vida. Los NPC de este juego están allí para rellenar un poco el mapa, no tienen líneas de diálogo ni hacen nada más que no sea andar de un lado para otro (me refiero a fuera de Hogwarts). Lo peor del juego, es que te lleva de la mano en todo momento, todo está ""cerca"" o hay un punto de viaje rápido a 4 pasos. Las misiones no tiene ningún sentido con la trama principal, ni hacen nada para que conectes con los personajes secundarios que te las mandan. Todas son cortadas con el mismo patrón, camina, mata, vuelve, repite. Los puzles son extremadamente básicos y las secuencias de vídeo soporíferas. Debo reconocer que la primera hora y media de juego es alucinante, una maravilla, pero siento que tras ese corto período de juego, no tengo más ganas de perder tiempo con este título (SUERTE QUE NO LO COMPRÉ A PRECIO COMPLETO DE SALIDA). En lo técnico, un desastre, no puedes selecionar la resolución que mejor se adapte a tu hardware, si no que siempre va a arrancar con la resolución nativa de tu monitor (a menos que lo ejecutes en modo ventana). La utilización de los núcleos del procesador es pésima, resultando en un rendimiento inaceptable por muy buen hardware que tengas, por lo que (en mi caso) con una RTX4070 Super, podía jugarlo en medio a 1440p 60fps o ultra 30fps. Lo dicho, no puedo pedir reembolso por el tiempo de juego que es demasiado largo, ya que tenía la esperanza de que mejoraría con el tiempo. Se que es una review demasiado larga, pero espero que no te pase lo mismo que a mi, todo el mundo lo ponía por las nubes, alabando todo lo que tenía que ver con este título.

Amazing artstyle that pays homage to classic jrpgs
8 characters each with their own story and playstyle
Good voice overs,  nice music

Cons

Inexcusably tedious combat
Boring
Lacking polish

Octopath Traveler would have been great on SNES or PS1 back in the late 90s but for this era it is very dated which is a shame because graphically, it has a lot of vintage charm with nice graphics and some interesting story telling that unfortunately is let down by obnoxiously slow paced combat that makes the game get exceptionally boring fast forcing the player to either not bother and move on to a faster paced game,   even by all classic snes jrpgs virtually none have the same tedious turn based combat style.

Square Enix, you know better!  Don't ever make a turn based JRPG that takes several minutes just to beat one basic monster this makes for a tedious eye rolling slog.

Octopath Traveler,1057090,7.49,0,solo,Action,Bertucciop,"Octopath traveler, they haven't worked enough on it and ask for 60€ for it. Made on Unreal Engine for quick development I think for commercial reasons. Below I break down the different aspects of the game.

Fantastic music, sound track is the best of the game. Each character has his own music theme, maybe too melancholic but is a 10/10.

The plot is too simple and linear, cliche characters, there is no evolution in them over time. Too Manichean, evil and good well separated. A noble girl becomes a prostitute seeking for vengeance for no reason, instead of using her money and inheritance for it. Anyways narrative is ok, it is ok even if it is full of topics and empty of plot twists. It is a game for kids, not a book. Hire a Jewish screenwriter to review it before starting though, Square Enix 6/10.

Gameplay is horrible, it is a typical 90's RPG game, but dynamics are too slow.

They made a weakness point counter system which stuns and weakens enemies when they came to 0. But there are not any strategic but this in the game. In addition, they made an initiative point system, these points increase if you do not use them, and they boost your skills and attacks.

Both systems combined make combat so tedious as you have to wait turns taking enemies weaknesses points as you wait to your initiative points to increase for making massive damage.

Boss fights long the same as common fights. And skills are limited, attack, heal, low, and increase defense and attack. Enemies can blind, sleep, etc. you but it is very limited to you to do these things. You have very powerful ultimate skills at your disposal that end a combat after gaining some initiative points.

These long fights appears each two steps on map, so you can't walk at all, unless you have a mage on team who provides of an extension walking longitude before fighting. Game is hardly bearable even with this mage's skill, it is unplayable if u don't have this.

You do not need to properly manage your items, you are full of healing things and other things, you will never run out of them, even resurrection items.

There is not any puzzle on map, just walking, taking treasure chests (some are hidden by 2D vision perspective) and fighting.

The interaction of the NPCs is the 90's RPGs and they added that, depending of which character is in your team, you can steal or trade items with them, even fight a duel or investigate them, which improves skills or shows you the positions of hidden items, which is a great thing, but the plot is linear so when you get to a village you just examine, steal or trade with everyone to get new items and upgrade skills, you can also have an NPC character following you and help you in battles, you cannot control them .

You cannot make any decision, there are not dialogues which spread a list of answers, plot is linear.
3/10

Talking about graphics, all goods things and effects came from Unreal Engine basics, so they didn’t have to work so much on it, they made low quality sprites for characters, and cartoon textures for the 3D maps and a static camera angle imitating 90's RPG quality, Low-cost graphics which did not provide budget for extending other game features.2/10

In conclusion this game is just an experimental game made by Square Enix for commercial researches.

Octopath Traveler,1057090,7.49,0,solo,Action,JanaWonderland,"This is among the most disappointing JRPGs I've ever played.

At first I was pulled in by its beautiful artstyle and more than beautiful soundtrack, but that is pretty much it. You could compare it to a disfigured and moldy pumpkin trying to hide its atrocities behind make up and plastic surgeries.

The writing is beyond horrible. Characters that almost constantly act out of character, don't make sense whatsoever and doing things that - sure keep the story going but - do not make sense whatsoever. And instead of anyone questioning their behaviour like a normal person would, everyone just takes it the way it is. Good writing shouldn't need these inconsistencies only to keep the story going, instead its characters should keep it going naturally. Other than that it was able to partake in the biggest sin of story-writing possible: Overexposition. Whatever you see on screen, the game will not hesitate to think you stupid enough not to have taken in what happened and explains it in great depths, over and over again. Then of course it also mostly deals with themes explored by many RPGs before it, making it feel even lazier and more uncreative.

If that was the only gripe I have with this game, at the very least it could be a fun little gameplay-heavy game, but the gameplay is subpar at best for that to happen. Enemies, no matter if random encounter or bosses, are the epitome of bulletsponges. Fights are far from hard, after hours of playing it not once did I die, but instead fights are stretched out like an old stepped upon bubblegum. They are merely there to artificially make the game longer. Enemies weaknesses do not make sense most of the time and unlike other, good, JRPGs are just a guessing game, which makes the fights even more atrocious. The animations, slowdowns and particle effects at least make the actual attacks feel satisfying, but if the main parts of the fighting system can't hold up, that doesn't save it either.

So the fighting system is frustratingly annoying and the story-writing is insultingly bad... What else makes a good RPG? Freedom and exploring! The game is rather free with you being able to choose from 8 different characters that have different stories from the start to fit your playstyle. However outside of battle - in which they all behave relatively same-y - they only get one ""skill"" for you to use. Things like being able to steal from people, charm them or provocate them for a fight should make the game more interesting, but they barely have any consequences outside of what items you got, how much experience you get or which places to go. Places are by the way scarce. The big ""open"" world is designed in such a linear fashion, that exploration mostly consists of going off the path for a few seconds to open randomly placed chests. Now linearity is not a bad thing per se, but in a game where there isn't much of anything else, it was the last hope to get some good out of it.

The controls weren't problematic, as I've played it with my gamepad instead of using my mouse and keyboard, as that is just my preferred way of playing JRPGs. So I can't say much about how it does control with mouse and keyboard.

My recommendation is to save your money for something better. The gameplay, the story and the exploration are beyond disappointing. Listen to the soundtrack on YouTube or buy it extra somewhere else and avoid this game as well as possible.",False,N/A,N/A,"Sep 17, 2019"

Whether it's a feeling manifested by loss, disappointment, anger, a chemical imbalance in your brain, disease, depression, or any of the other thousands of reasons is ultimately irrelevant. The point is that most people have felt this feeling in their own unique way. GRIS starts with that exact feeling. A character that sees no colour in the world, no life, no meaning, and no voice of her own, with trials and tribulations designed in a way that actively set her back, trying to impede her progress. Gameplay-wise, many of these obstacles are very easy to deal with. However, metaphorically, whenever Gris overcomes these setbacks, she heals a tiny bit of her psyche. More and more life, colour, and joy is brought back into her world, which is beautifully realised with both the gorgeous art design and a sublime soundtrack composed by the band Berlinist.

Unlike previous games some characters lack depth and are in a way less serious to previous yakuza games.

the game combat system gets very repetitive and it is very slow. for people who use to play the game only for the sake of the main story, now have to be ready to grind a lot to be on the same level as the enemy.
combat system can leave you wanting to tear your hair and smash your head against the keyboard. a third of the time you will see your character running to the enemy and back to his position.

from my readings the developers had to change the project direction, because beat em up was not attracting enough players from the japanese market, but in doing so they took one of the core elements of the game.

the fights not only in the sub story but also in the main story became way too comical, a charachter would blow a kiss to an enemy lowering their defense stats, compared to the old games where majima or kiryu would scream furiously and charge their heat to pull sick moves.

the city is impressive as always the side activites too. the graphics is great, voice acting I can not complain always on point.

big minus points are the grinding you might need to spend 8 hours or so preparing for a fight. a fight can take 45 mins to an hour sometimes and it is less exciting and extremely repetitve, you would skip some turns with no action just to heal your charachters.

as someone who played yakuza from 0 until 7 I unfortunately might stop following the series or just watch a lets play on YouTube, because i can not put myself through a yakuza similar to like a dragon. I quit the game toward the last 3 or 2 chapters and started watching lets play while skipping the fights, during my own gameplay i left it on autopilot sometimes until fights finished and then I came back.",False,N/A,N/A,"Aug 24, 2021"

We go from the legends and high level yakuza glory and drama with a Kiryu of dignified tragic grandeur and the other legends and their stories to childlike **** and bums with endless UI and dialogue that just crawls along. GAG. The writers LOVE orphans, they love surrogate paternal relationships, they love all types of perversions and all sorts of  videogame culture, we get it this is just over the top and does NOT fit in very well with the series as a whole. I don't play turn based combat games, it's too automatic and too UI heavy I prefer control over the experience as much as possible with the least UI in the way. One aspect of why I've played and replayed 0-6 is that it's NOT TURN BASED. This is serviceable but I did NOT play Dragon Quest so the references mean nothing to me. Ichiban seems to SHOUT his lines rather than speak and it sounds like he's on drugs lol. The larger maps are pretty empty and generic, even reworked from Y4/Y5 to my eye. I think Y6 was about 40gb, this monster is 60gb and for what? so they can shout MA MORE! BLOATED. The back stories are just not believable, although that's true for most yakuza games to be fair.

I will caveat that I'm about 5-10 hours in, and have heard lots of good things about the story, however honestly I don't really care about stories anyway unless they're unbelievable and unique. So far this feels a bit pretentious and isn't really resonating with me

Hate the autosave mechanic, derives from Dark Souls but worse and adds nothing. The map is also awful, trying to force exploration but within quite an empty, uninteresting world 
The map design is also very poor. I have spent up to an hour in several areas just trying to find stuff, leave areas or having to re-tread steps

Enemy design has very little variety and for the first 5 hours it felt like most enemies were damage sponges (although that is improving now)

TLDR:
Pros:
-Good visuals, although not amazing
-Combat does look cool at times 
-Interesting premise
-Music is good at some points and quite unique

Cons:
-Very unintuitive
-Story is hit or miss, and is heavily pushed in a very Japenese manga style, which can hugely drag pacing

I went through the whole ordeal and finished the game with all three characters and the first ending was by far the best one. The other two added a twist and meta modernist ramblings, but I honestly didn't care since all the characters are cold and unlikeable. The game never even gives you a choice to save X but give up Y like in the Witcher 3. There's no interactive storytelling with the 26 endings, just forced cinematics to one end that is worse than the other. Also the forced themes and parallels to our society were really tired.

Stray,1332010,17.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie",Samvell,"Probably a good game if you just wanna turn off your brain and vibe, but the game has nothing else to offer. There's close to no gameplay. You just **** around the environments the whole game. I'd say the game has a nice, relaxed atmosphere to it, but vibes can only carry the game so far.
The graphics are definitely nice. Yes, it's 2015 level graphics, but the overall art direction is great. Except for the cats themselves, which often trigger that uncanny valley feeling in the cutscenes. The music is sparse and amorphous. For the most part it felt very unintrusive, and intentionally so. I'd say it fits the game well, although there's a slim chance I'll ever wanna hear it outside of the game. I have to note though that some musical cues felt off at times. For example, there was this one time when I was just walking down an alley and this really intense ""action"" music started playing for some reason, even though there was no action going on in the game at the moment whatsoever.
The game design felt inconsistent. A lot of the objects are climbable, while others that look exactly the same aren't for some reason.
I wasn't a fan of the scripted events either. There is one early on in the game where you have to run from zurks and I failed it like four times in a row. Why? Because the moment you have to jump off the ledge you can't  press W+Space, you have to press just Space, unlike the rest of the game where W+Space works just fine. It's little inconsistencies like these that really ruin the enjoyment and leave a bitter taste in my mouth.
Overall, this is a pretty great sci-fi cat simulator. If you like cats and don't like thinking, I'd say this game is definitely for you. Me though, I couldn't help but feel utterly bored.",False,N/A,N/A,"Jun 14, 2024"

La base de todo es la fantasía de jugar como un gato, pero al final más que hacer eso lo que tienes es un walking simulator donde el personaje es un gato pero mucho de lo que haces no es lo que haría un gato. Añade al walking simulator algo de diálogo para crear una historia super básica y genérica, algunos puzzles tan sencillos que llamarlos puzzles es una exageración y algunas secciones un poco más ágiles y más o menos tienes el juego. Lo que quedaría es la parte de exploración para encontrar objetos ocultos y así pero esa parte en general es floja, siendo las zonas muy pequeñas en su mayoría.Gráficamente el juego está bastante bien ejecutado, especialmente el gato está fantástico, pero a mi a nivel estético me acabó cansando mucho. El sonido es más bien flojo, con unos efectos escasos y repetitivos, y una música poco presente y que en general mejor sin ella. Y el juego tiene importantes bugs, causando reinicios de ordenador e incluso llegué a un punto en que hay que hablar con un PNJ y no quería, siendo imposible avanzar en el juego y me dio demasiada pereza volver a empezarlo (probé a reempezar el capítulo y mismo problema) así que no pude acabarlo y eso que es un juego muy corto (tiene un logro para hacerlo en menos de 2 **** resultado, en mi opinión, es una oportunidad perdida.

Dont Starve,219740,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",UncleEd,"Tedious game with a beautiful make-up. Don’t Starve is one of the more popular indie games of the recent years for reasons I simply do not understand. It does look charming indeed. In fact, it has beautiful Tim Burtonesque style graphics and the game easily grabs the attention of anyone who takes a look at the screenshots. You start as a character whose only goal is to survive as long as possible. Similar to other survival games, you farm, craft, build to stay alive. The first problem with Don’t Starve is that the grinding part is simply boring. Often, it feels like a flash game with a fairly bad user interface where you click, click, click with your left mouse button without having any kind of fun. If you are curious about how grinding can be fun, please check Terraria out.

Second major problem with Don’t Starve is the permadeath. I am not suggesting that permadeath is bad per se, it can be quite enjoyable when it is done right. In Don’t Starve, however, it turns the tedious game design into something unbearable. You may find yourself grinding for hours, just to die by a random encounter (and it won’t be your fault). Oh yeah, some might suggest “that’s what the game is about” or “you will learn from your death”. Just give me a break… By now you should have played plenty of difficult video games to differentiate good game design from bad ones. Just look at the Souls series. When you die, you know you made a mistake. Maybe you made your move too early. Maybe you did not block the attack when you were supposed to. And if you die, you may lose your “souls” and thereby some of your progress, but not the entire game. In Don’t Starve, unless you are playing with a second monitor with wiki open, there is no way of knowing what will kill you. The only way to learn about what kills you is to be killed by it. And then you will start over, go through the tedious grind for hours and die again for another reason you could simply not prevent. In Don’t Starve, you are Sisyphus…

Last but not the least, the combat is atrocious. Combat in Don’t Starve is literally the same combat in any of the other thousands of flash games. If you have a good armor, left click the enemy until it dies. Or alternatively, make the enemy chase you and do your attacks while you are on the run.

If dull, repetitive games with poorly executed game mechanics are for you, play Don’t Starve. If you have a friend who happens to have the same tastes as you do, play Don’t Starve Together. But if it is the art style that pulls you in, your valuable time would be much better spent rewatching The Nightmare Before Christmas.

My favorite boss fight was the Mantis Lords one, which almost feels like a rhythm game because of how perfectly timed everything is.

The map is huge and packed with secrets, and every single area is memorable. After spending several hours in the game, you start to know your way around instinctively.

Hollow Knight was a random exploding success, a genre definer, something every subsequent metroidvania is held up to and compared with. The gameplay loop is sleek and sharp, the map and currency systems solid, the charm builds customisable. Exploration is rewarded and there is no right way to play. The sense of wonder and dread as we explore the buried kingdom, the challenge of the bosses and the platforming, the utterly stunning world and character design, and Christopher Larkin's generational soundtrack, all come together into what I dare call the prime metroidvania. This game has held strong, the lore and horrifically tragic story keeping audiences engaged for more than half a decade, and is a prime example of how love for the craft always beats the love of cash.

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",ThatoneHELP,"Omori, for a RPG made by a small dev team and being OMOCATS first game. Is probably one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time in the RPG aspect. Now the reason? The story, Besides the random negative reviews that sound like they were asleep while playing the game And writing the reviews. The games gameplay is fine, not anything groundbreaking but it is enjoyable. But the story, music and art (in cutscenes) is immaculate. It is the most deep game I have ever played, and I am confident that I will never forget this story, now I won't spoil anything because this is a game genuinely needed to be played blind. But if my word doesn't mean anything, you can search up OMORI on YouTube and you can see so many different YouTubers, big and small praising the game in thumbnails and stuff. It makes sense too.

The game has around 20 hours of gameplay and six years of real life development to flesh out everything from the story to the music and hand drawn and pixel art.

Now I get it, OMORI isn't for everyone, the game is rated M for a reason and it is not because of swearing, sex or violence (No Humphrey doesn't count), it genuinely gets that deep. And in MY summary? If you like RPG games OR like games or media with a good story, OMORI will GENUINELY be the closest you get to a MUST-PLAY (also it's worth the 20 dollars btw, crazy how pokemon legends ZA is 70 yet absolute dog **** compared to OMORI OR literally ANY other indie game.)

And key note, Omori in all is a serious game, so if you can't take it seriously, then you most likely won't enjoy it to the degree that everyone else playing the game did. Omori at its core is a STORY game. So I don't actually advise playing it if you don't like a good story, but if you do it's a near must play.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 26, 2025"

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Anonymus97,"Let’s cut through the pastel-colored fog: Omori is a confused, clunky mess that tries to be everything and ends up being nothing. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of mismatched genres—psychological horror, quirky comedy, slice-of-life drama—all stitched together with the subtlety of a Tumblr meme dump. The tonal whiplash is real: one moment you're navigating trauma, the next you're watching a talking toaster crack jokes. It’s not clever—it’s **** controls are stiff and outdated, a relic of RPG Maker’s limitations. Movement feels sluggish, menus are unintuitive, and the interface design is more aesthetic than functional. It’s like the developers prioritized mood boards over playability.Combat? A snoozefest. The emotion system is a neat idea on paper, but in practice it’s shallow and repetitive. Battles drag on with little strategic depth, and the pacing is glacial. You’ll spend more time mashing attack than actually thinking. Compared to other indie RPGs with tactical nuance, Omori feels like a **** characters are painfully flat. Sunny, Basil, Aubrey—none of them evolve meaningfully beyond their archetypes. They exist to serve the plot’s emotional beats, not to feel like real people. Dialogue is often stilted, and the attempts at humor land with the grace of a brick. It’s the kind of writing that might resonate with someone deep in a Tumblr echo chamber, but outside of that bubble, it’s hard to take **** let’s talk about the reviews. The praise surrounding Omori is almost cult-like, centered almost exclusively on its “sad story.” But that’s the bait. The game leans heavily on trauma and tragedy to mask its mechanical shortcomings. It’s emotional manipulation dressed up as profundity. Critics and fans alike seem so enamored with the ending’s gut punch that they ignore the slog it takes to get there.",False,N/A,N/A,"Oct 13, 2025"

It’s about the POV / life **** who grows older and you see his life unfold. The start of the game you’re greeted with a ferryman who wants to hear about your life and then it’s shown blah blah, there’s some twists and turns at some point in the game yadda… basically the way the story is executed and reveals is so clever and I think the medium of vr with this blink mechanic drives the emotion home because, with blinking enabled, you forcefully don’t want to miss anything important, you wana not accidentally blink and miss out on a chunk of the story. I think playing the game with it enabled works well (I was advised to turn the mechanic off but I think it worked better having that experience). Metaphorically the “blink and you’ll miss it” idea is neat, for a story driven game you don’t wana miss out on a chunk of the person’s life or story and you don’t know what’ll happen next in their life. It’s an interesting and very emotional game, from the segments with the ferryman to the sound design, writing and voice acting it’s all ace and very emotional not only at the end, but just throughout as it throws around many heartbreaking moments so well, the littlest things are so sad to hear.Great short game and I get the hype for it.

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy",apeot2002,"Life is Strange: True Colors reclaims the franchise’s strength, but its weaknesses, too.

First off, I need to declare my bias: I regard the original Life is Strange as one of the best, most memorable gaming experiences in my life. I liked the prequel “Before the Storm” well enough, mostly because it gave me more of one of my favorite characters. Life is Strange 2, however, left me cold.

So when I say that True Colors felt like a return to form for me, that is high praise. This slice of life story around another teen with with supernatural abilities (supernatural empathy instead of time manipulation) making their home in a small community inhabited by quirky, well realized character (Colorado mining town instead of Oregon coastal village) is just as engrossing, charming and gripping as the tale of Chloe and Max was.

Alex Chen, an orphan grown up in the system and our protagonist, has had a hard life, but things are looking up for her. Upon invitation by her estranged but loving brother, she moves to the small mining town of Haven Springs, and right then and there the game won me over: This very first scene is incredibly bucolic, full of life, color and golden sunlight. You can practically smell the fresh mountain air. That was the first hook that got me.

The second hit home only minutes after, when I witnessed the awkward reunion between Alex and her brother. Both of them didn’t quite know how to deal with each other and the situation, and I could read every conflicting emotion, not only in the excellent voice performances, but in their expressions and body language, too, and it all felt so true, so emotionally resonant that I couldn’t help falling in love with these two lovable, damaged humans trying clumsily to connect to each other, the captured facial animations were that good. 

These two things, colorful, joyful art direction and charming, emotionally resonant characters are the great strengths of this game, and they made playing through it a joy. Together, they convincingly create the idyllic atmosphere of a tight-knit community living in the ideal small town. Or would, if the actual plot didn’t complicate things. There is actually quite a bit of socio-political commentary to be found, if you’re open for that kind of thing.

The plot itself meanders a bit at times, but still creates room for a few incredibly moving scenes, the odd successful twist and ultimately a finale that for all its understated subtlety packs an incredible punch. Unfortunately there are a few mediocre valleys between these peaks of engagement, and a lot of them have to do with the implementation of Alex’s superpower. While the idea of Super Empathy is fascinating and is used very well during the high points of the narrative, Deck Nine struggled to create meaningful everyday applications of it. But they couldn’t let it lie either, thus Alex has to empath her way through way too many two sentence dialog sequences with no import and no emotional resonance.

As a controller-based adventure game, there are few gameplay systems to be had, and the riddles here barely deserve the name. There are precious few things to be discovered away from the beaten path. Innovation is scarce, after you’re over the incredibly improved character animations. If you are not here for the characters, the vibes and the story, you might not have a good time.

But if you are, if you want to see Alex through her journey, smile with her, commiserate with her tears, you will find it incredibly easy to fall in love with her, and with Haven Springs. 

TLDR: True Colors is a return to form for the Life is Strange franchise. While it might be just one step above a walking simulator, this game will nevertheless charm you with its characters and atmosphere.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 10, 2025"

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Ciocolici,"Life is Strange: True Colors, a game I've been eagerly anticipating, truly lived up to my expectations. As a long-time fan of LiS, I was curious to see how Deck Nine would handle this installment, given their previous work on Before the Storm, which, while decent, was just a prequel with an existing storyline. However, True Colors presented a completely original tale from start to finish, and boy, did they deliver excellently.

The gameplay remains familiar, but with intriguing new features and gameplay elements tied to the protagonist's unique power, adding a fresh twist. The choices I made felt relevant, and I relished the various options I had throughout the game. The graphics are generally fantastic, but there was one gripe that broke my immersion - witnessing sudden changes in texture quality when new objects or scenes appeared. Additionally, there were occasional instances of unexpected FPS drops that lingered for entire scenes, albeit these were rare occurrences, happening maybe three or four times in the entire game. Despite these minor issues, I must commend the breathtaking scenery and the phenomenal OST. The soundtrack, in particular, was truly outstanding, capturing that classic LiS essence. The visuals might not reach the level of DontNod's previous works, but they were still stunning, and the facial animations were incredibly impressive, surpassing my expectations even after seeing them in the trailers. Can you believe it's still LiS?

Now, onto the heart of it - this game screams Life is Strange through and through. It radiates more LiS vibes than LiS 2 ever did, and Alex, the main character, is simply the cutest, most lovable character the series has seen so far. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted and captivating. While it may not have outdone the brilliance of the first LiS, I found myself emotionally invested in Alex's story right from the first chapter (now chapters instead of episodes). Her heartrending backstory evokes empathy early on, which is a definite plus. I did sense that Life is Strange and LiS 2 were more expansive in some ways - not just gameplay or story-wise, but in terms of the world they built. True Colors felt somewhat smaller in comparison, though I still adored the story and its universe and couldn't help but make some comparisons throughout my playthrough. There were moments where I felt the final episode could have been handled better, though it wasn't bad by any means; it just had room for improvement in certain aspects, in my opinion.

In conclusion, I absolutely loved Life is Strange: True Colors. It successfully encompassed everything that makes LiS special - it was great, melancholic, intense, and captivating all at once. It captured those emotional highs and lows I've come to associate with the series, leaving me thoroughly engrossed in the story. While I personally enjoyed it more than LiS 2, it still couldn't dethrone the original LiS from its throne (no comparison with BtS or Captain, as that wouldn't be fair). More LiS games, please! I can't get enough of this world, and I eagerly await any new installments that may come our way.",True,N/A,N/A,"Aug 5, 2023"

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy",KinimodYunmi,"Dieser Teil zerreißt einen emotional leider nicht so extrem bzw. überhaupt als in Life is Strange und Life is Strange Before the Storm. Auch die ""holy ****"" Momente, die es zumindest noch in Life is Strange 2 gab, gibt es nicht mehr. Man hat leider auch das Gefühl, dass jede Entscheidung recht egal ist, da es in normalen Dialogen kaum was ausmacht und die EINE ""große Entscheidung"" der Episode ist jetzt auch nichts weltbewegendes, die Story geht trotzdem ihren Weg, man kann dadurch nichts verhindern. Wenn man sich die Entscheidungen, wie üblich am Ende einer jeden Episode durchließt, merkt man das. Man hat lediglich die Wahl einer Person was zu erzählen oder nicht. Das juckt die Story aber nicht die Bohne, bis auf an einer Stelle, die aber auch total optional ist, danach setz die feste, unabänderbare Story wieder ein.

Es ist kein klassisches LiS, wie wir es gewohnt sind. Die schockierenden Momente, in denen man sich denkt, oh nein, das darf doch nicht wahr sein gibt es nicht, man wird emotional nur sehr gering mitgenommen und die zwei Stellen mit einer, ich sag mal Offenbarung von der Story des Spiels her, kann man sich sogar denken. Hier wurde sich darauf fokussiert mehr Gameplay einzubauen, anstatt eine extreme Story zu schreiben.

Die Story ist trotzdem schön und da ich das Spiel ein Wochenende lang genießen konnte, vor allem durch die klassische Life is Strange Musik, die immer sehr gut zur Atmosphäre gepasst hat, kann ich dem Spiel einfach keinen Daumen runter geben und freuen mich schon auf das Steph-DLC, in die ich mich auch wieder direkt verliebt habe.",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 11, 2023"

Sean's a kid too, and he sure as hell doesn't deserve all this. Anyway, I **** on this game enough, I stopped playing around midway in EP3 and the good things about this game are its amazing soundtrack and how good the art style looks. That's pretty much the only good things about it. Everything else is either average or below average like the super power of moving **** around is just inferior to what we had in LiS 1 and LiS True Colors and the story is just straight up dumb, Sean's decision is dumb and makes absolutely no sense story-wise and it's basically what the whole game revolves around. Oh and literally every single important decision is not up to you, Sean will just agree to all of Daniel's braindead moronic ideas that will keep getting you in all sorts of stupid troubles just so they can keep the story going.

I have played through The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct about 5 times now in attempts to save all the necessary survivors. EVERY time I have played through the game.. I have experienced different content (locations) I was not exposed to before...

I felt the AI was aptly responsive and worked very well. This is not the Left 4 Dead series... getting hit means soemthing... Stealth is somewhat required.

Sure, there could be more graphics tweaks, or coop, or pvp... but the game was just released... who knows what they may have in store later. Until then I found the game stimulating and entertaining all around. I also experienced no glitches or bugs.

At the end of the day.. this game was created for hardcore Walking Dead fans... which I am  and I love the game.

As tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something I dug, and it was done wonderfully here. The setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. The ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and I am both excited for and terrified of the sequel. Hopefully it lives up to the first game's quality and ties up the loose ends it needs to. (Sidenote I include with all Telltale reviews: Telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. Variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and I enjoy them when they do pop up in Telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. They're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. They influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. The joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. I think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, I'd temper your expectations.)",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 30, 2025"

And for telltale the most Dynamic in experience, and if anything its not about branching paths with these games its about how you yourself engage with everything that will depend on what you get. and for me, the inability to not change some things is actually in the games favor, Because I would much rather have crucial points, and a focus be uncompromising. the Empathetic thoughtful and even emotion and intense writing have kept this game as the only rival to the walking dead. I just oddly wish the aggroget was higher then 80 but equally as so I see it as just, well its a perception on what is actually important in a game. For the type of game this is, its about the experience of seeing the world, seeing the position of Bigby and what happens to him, some things that you believe is more important, which again will not change everything but more or less, will change how you view everything in each subsequent play through. Your aggression and your softness, your approach to each character, it often change me, and made me feel a roller coaster depending on what I said, when I didn't keep track of what I said and whether or not this guy was gonna say the same thing anyways, I was feel the very grounded, tight and honestly intricate story that pulls no punches and containing bold plot twists. Immersive, and emotional to its absolute core, I just wish It was longer. not so short, only going 10 hours but It has no filler, just opting for you as a player to just feel everything and take your time, and feel the vibe.

Lovecraft would have definitely liked this game: a short story about otherworldly horror. Maybe cosmic, maybe afterlife. Just the way he liked it. But for me personally, this game was on the verge of a 7 because walking around this island was very tiring, and because the dialogues required you to react quickly. I hate timed quests, timed traps, and timed dialogues, so for me it spoiled the feeling of the game a little. And the tedious walking could have been easily fixed with at least small fast-travel, like 4 benches in different corners of the island. And that's it. Because of this, I didn't really like running and looking for red frequencies first, and then running around the island again looking for these damn notes... and also hunting for different endings.

Oxenfree prompts players to reflect on the control we have over our lives. It's a journey through acceptance, illustrating that acknowledging the past allows for moving forward. I love how deeply one can dig for lore in this game, even extending to an ARG.

Mitigé. C'est l'émotion que je ressens à la fin de ce jeu.Mais c'est aussi celle que j'ai ressenti dès le début. Plonger dans un monde étant l'archétype même des clichés pour adolescent ca ne me grisait pas trop au début.

Une grosse déception en fin de compte cette histoire et ce jeu. On est resté trop proche du jeu pour ado-bobo et ce, malgré quelques moments sympas. Cela est peut-être lié à mes choix de dialogues (non), d'ailleurs parlons de ces choix !Quelle honte, baser son jeu sur des choix mais ne laisser au joueur que 2-3 secondes pour lire les 3 choix qui s'offrent à lui, tout en devant comprendre la quantité abondante de dialogue qu'il ingurgite depuis un moment, et sans oublier la cerise sur le gâteau : les dialogues qui continuent pendant que tu dois faire tes choix sur ceux-ci. J'espère que vous serez rapides, vous avec 2 secondes, top chrono ! Non sérieusement c'est certainement la chose la plus conne que j'aie vu dans un jeu.Ajouter encore à ça un défaut terrible pour un jeu qui veut baser son expérience sur l'histoire et les dialogues : Le ""doublage"" atroce. Pas du tout au niveau pour ce jeu. Aucune émotion dégagée dans les voix. Que ce soit de la tristesse, de la peur ou de la joie, tout est plat. Dommage et fatal pour **** faut encore ajouter à tout ça, des décors pas beaux, des contrôles et déplacements relevant du supplice, et une bande son qui parfois, ne colle pas du tout avec l'ambiance du jeu. Je ne sais pas si cette contradiction est voulue, mais pour moi, c'est de mauvais gout.Cependant il y a un problème... l'ambiance globale du jeu dégage quelque chose !

The background music was good and it created the typical atmosphere which fitted in the game. I really liked the genre of the game, it was spooky but at the same time pretty emotional, and the best part was that everything was unexpected.

La historia está bien, sin ser excelente y tiene una duración acertada para el tipo de juego que es, aunque no tiene gran rejugabilidad, más allá de los completistas y coleccionistas de logros. Tiene dos finales, pero da pereza volver a jugar el juego entero buscando las dos chorradas que se te pasaron en la primera partida.

Little Misfortune,1051510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,PublicNuisance,"I have seen a lot of people online saying how they liked Fran Bow but didn’t like Little Misfortune due to the lack of puzzles. I can understand that because I have the opposite reaction for the same reasons. Fran Bow was a puzzle game that had a fantastic narrative while Little Misfortune is just a narrative game without the puzzles. I disliked the puzzles in Fran Bow so Little Misfortune was basically giving me what I enjoyed from Fran Bow and leaving out what I didn’t. The art style is great and carries onto the credits which is a unique one. The voice acting is fantastic. Both Misfortune and The Voice. There are moments which are sad, funny and in between and they nail all of them. Misfortune has a interesting accent and way of speaking which is a mix of child and adult. There are a lot of points which are pretty macabre, to the point where I surprised the developers took it as far as they did  but was glad they did. The nightclub full of hamsters comes to mind. I don’t think the game would have grabbed a hold of me the way it did if they had of held back. The music was also very interesting as it made me think of an Eastern European disco and a cyberpunk synth type of vibe. There isn’t much in terms of “game play” here. Most of the game is you making choices and interacting with the environment to proceed. I don’t say this as a slight against the game because the story was great. Had the story been bad then the game would have fallen apart because there was nothing else to hold it together but luckily it was good. In regards to choices when The Voice says that there are no good or bad choices, just consequences, they mean it. It made me think of the episode of The X-Files with a genie who when granting your wish would always find a way to warp what you asked for in a way you hadn’t expected. For instance a person asked for a boat and got it but then realized they would have to pay docking fees, maintenance fees and taxes on the boat that they hadn’t thought of and thus they couldn’t even use the boat that they had asked for. There are a lot of things like that associated with the choices you make in Little Misfortune so don’t try to over analyze it, the Voice will find a way to turn your choice bad regardless and I have to say that was a sadly realistic take on things from the developers. I was left with some questions such as just how Morgo was defeated; who was responsible for what happened to Misfortune; what role we the player played seeing as how the Voice talked to us as well but overall enjoyed myself. The middle part of the game had some stretches where not much happened in the story but it got past that.

I played Little Misfortune on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any bugs. There was an option for V-Sync; PostFX and resolution. Alt-Tab didn’t work. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were 3 save slots available. You could also just use the auto save feature if you wanted. You can’t pause or skip cut scenes. The game ran great with no drops in frame rate.

Game Engine: Unity
Graphics API: OpenGL
Save System: Manual and Auto
Input Used: Mouse and keyboard
Game Version Played: 1.0

GPU Usage: 0-57 %
VRAM Usage: 685-1219 MB
CPU Usage: 3-8 %
RAM Usage: 2.2-2.7 GB
Frame Rate: 132-144 FPS

If you are willing to accept narrative over game play then Little Misfortune has a lot to offer. A great story; voice acting and art style. It has it’s limitations and leaves some questions on the table but overall I came away impressed. It is equal parts cute; macabre; sad; and funny. There is a demo available for those who want to try it first.

Little Misfortune,1051510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,TitaniumDragon,"Little Misfortune is a walking simulator masquerading as a point and click adventure game. There are no puzzles of note here, and the game is a strictly linear path from start to finish.

I don’t have anything against walking simulators, but a walking simulator lives and dies on plot and presentation. And unfortunately, Little Misfortune falls short on both.

This is a game that is deliberately ugly. The characters are all deliberately drawn to be “off”, and everything is drawn to have a run-down and often outright creepy vibe. The main character has a veneer of innocence but obviously has had a messed up life with a messed up family, and the only really nice thing in the game – “Mr. Voice”, the voice in her head – is obviously evil, with the first thing he tells us being that Little Misfortune, the “protagonist” of the work, is going to die.

And while all of this can work if there’s a strong plot and purpose to it, honestly, this game isn’t impressive at all in that department. The problem is that Little Misfortune isn’t a particularly interesting character – she’s a little girl from a messed up family, and she is more or less the same person at the start as she is at the end. The entire plot of the game is an excuse to take us through a series of rather morbid areas while being led on by Mr. Voice, and while the game does try to misdirect us about when and how Misfortune is going to die, that’s really the only “trick” it has up its sleeve. The game is very transparent about almost everything that is really going on, and the overall morbid and gross-out “humor” that the game leans on wears on the audience after playing for only a short while. It is just too one note, and as I never actually came to care about Little Misfortune, there was nothing to connect with here.

I can’t recommend this. It is endlessly morbid, but the messed up humor of the walking simulator is basically three hours of variations on the same joke, and there is a great deal of meandering around before the work finally goes somewhere.",False,N/A,N/A,"Apr 3, 2021"

Inscryption,1092790,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",johko,"I'll be honest. I was very much on the fence about whether I wanted to play the full game after trying the demo but I sure am glad I did. Inscryption is more than it appears to be on the surface and did not fail to delight me all the way through.

The card game itself is fun. It is pretty much a stripped down version of Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone, but the rogue-like campaign format suits it well as you can beef up your deck in ways that would be considered game-breaking in a traditional CCG against human players. If you ever fantasized about having OP cards in these types of games, Insrcyption can very much fulfill that fantasy. The drawback of that is that perhaps it allows a bit too much freedom; if you are at all familiar with the fundamental principles of CCGs and have some basic understanding of deck building and card value, the game will not be a challenge to you.

But I liked that. I honestly did not need the game to be challenging for it to be entertaining. I got to play it the way I wanted to play it, and that was fun for me. The difficulty curve is a bit wonky and it does somewhat lessen the impact by failing to provide a steady increase of difficulty, but this is a minor complaint on my end. The good thing is that it is highly unlikely that you will feel stuck or frustrated at this game for not being able to get through it. The focus here is on the experience rather than the challenge. Inscryption actually has a pretty elegantly integrated hand-holding system to nudge you in the right direction without being overtly obvious about it.

I have to praise the tone and atmosphere of this game. The music and sound design is perfect and the visuals set a unique, haunting tone. Even the camera movements bring about a sense of nostalgia without making the game feel clunky. There are certain parts of the game I would like to review but I am trying to keep this spoiler free, so I'll just say that it never gets boring and that there's always something new to delight your eyes and ears.

The weakest part of Inscryption is probably the ""puzzles."" A lot of these can be passed just by pure random guessing and maybe that was the point. If puzzles aren't your thing, you don't have to worry because they're quite frivolous.

Take your time with this game and savor it. Be creative. It's a good one.

Inscryption,1092790,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Bahia8000,"Interesting game. Inscryption is pretty decent, an adventure that changes gameplay and art per acts, tons of secrets, fun gameplay and a interesting lore.

Gameplay wise game is divided into 3 acts that play pretty different. They are each different in gameplay and style each with its own secrets. The first act is pretty fun, explorable, filled with secrets, great art style and a nice pacing. Second one and third one are kinda spoiler ish, but they change, the second one is more about strategy, you do your deck and also have a little adventure. The third one is similar to the first but its less luck based and more skill. The first one is by far the best, well done gameplay system and mechanics, more secrets than any other act, characters, a very interesting place you can walk on and its kind of short but it hits the sweetspot.

Art style and visuals are interesting, they are done with care and suprisingly good, the first and third act have a dark tone while the second ressembles more like a classic rpg (a lot darker). I liked most of the designs and i liked how unique it looks.

Story wise, there are 2 parts. The direct one which is easy to understand, but it is kinda generic, the first act does a good job in keeping it mysterious and interesting, while the second and third kind of abandon that or at least doesnt execute it as well as the first. You have the indirect one, told trough IRL videos and secrets hidden in the game which is pretty complicated, but can be fun.

As for other stuff, OST was decent, nothing id listen but fits the game neatly and thats more than enough. Controls and gameplay is agile for experienced players but you can play it slow until you know more the stuff. 

Its a fun experience, Worth 7-10$, it doesnt last long, after whatever time you take on act 1, the others are 2 hours each, second maybe less, third, maybe more. First like an average of 3 hours, but if you like discovering secrets maybe more",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 28, 2025"

Inscryption,1092790,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Nazrielau05,"Act 1 :I loved the experience. Like i'm usually not into card games at all but this game's presentation and art style in general absorbed into the game almost immediately. It's dark as **** but not in a way that you couldn't see anything, you see just enough for you to put things together and try to figure out the puzzle pieces in the game. The game has this sort of gritty feel to it. I don't wanna say edgy cause it's definitely not that, but it's atmosphere is creepy and unsettling enough to make me wanna piss myself(Positive sentiment).

Act 2 :This part of the game is probably the most controversial one. It changes the presentation drastically. Even though yes the core gameplay is still the same turn based deck building card mechanics, the visuals take a huge turn here. From a heavily stylized 3D gritty horror-ish art direction, it turns itself to a pixelated 2D perspective. It was a necessary decision to build a visual direction that could explain the lore and lay out the general gameplay effectively. While i do think this visual presentation breaks the previous act's immersion and atmosphere, it was inevitable for this game to present itself in the more usual card game aethethic. BEFORE it brings you back to it's previous gritty/horror-ish atmosphere in the third act. I'm getting way ahead of myself here. But with that knowledge in mind, act 2's visual direction actually worked pretty well for a change of pace in contrast to the game's often gritty visual style.

Act 3 & overral thoughts :Absolutely my favourite part in the whole game. The visual presentation is incredibly good, the soundtrack elevates the experience, and stack it up with a genuinely well-made deck-building card game mechanics. Another thing that made this game popular is it's lore, overral story, and the Meta usage of how a video game works. They legit access some of your steam file for **** and giggles lmao i love this game. The story, the lore, and the creepy atmosphere immediately caught my attention and immersed me into the game entirely. I love it. This game is amazing. I could see myself playing this game over and over again just for the sake of it.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,RafaelGR,"PROS

- Unlike other TCGs (Duel links etc), Master Duel is F2P. With minimal daily grind anyone can make one meta deck per month.
- Smooth Yu-Gi-Oh simulator with great visuals.
-This game managed to bring back to Yu-Gi-Oh, players that haven’t touched a single card since 10-15 years ago. Also the replay feature is a great learning tool for not top tier players.

CONS

-The game feels empty. There’s only the ranked ladder mode and the occasional event for a few days every month.
-It can be very cruel for beginners, especially those that don’t even have knowledge of the TCG.

ONE LAST NOTE

This game has a different card pool (not up-to-date) and different ban list from the TCG. Many players find that a huge minus. But I feel that this is more a plus. This way there can be more diversity in the meta (for example Mathmecks) and also avoid bad metas (Tearlament tier 0 meta)",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 9, 2023"

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cloudzy,"I've been a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh for as long as I can remember. And while not perfect, Master Duel is fine. Any deck, if the player behind it is a good pilot, can climb the ranked ladder into Diamond. It also takes luck but we don't talk about that part. Just some broad points from playing the game for a year:

1.) For a game that's purely a multiplayer online battle simulator, the economy in Master Duel is above other popular online multiplayer games. 2.) Being a best of one format leads to more degenerate strategies like stun, obsessive amounts of flood gates, entries strategies dedicated to infinite negates, and ftks, that lead to some games being just plain unfun to play.

3.) The solo gates in my opinion do a fairly good job of not only teaching players all 6 of the summoning gimmicks, but also give players a insight to a number of different archetypes in solo mode so they can get an idea of what deck they would want to make in the game proper.

4.) I do wish there was more prominent modes besides ranked, the occasional festival, and maybe solo (if you squint hard enough.) Even with casual, team battles, and duel rooms, they either don't do anything to flaunt or show those modes off, or the only real enjoyment you can get is with friends.

5.) I wish there was more of an incentive to push in ranked. With the same rank up rewards you find in Bronze also being the rewards in Diamond, I feel like asides for bragging rights, Konami doesn't currently offer enough to sit down and grind on Master Duel.

Overall, like I started with earlier, this game is fine. There's things that I both like and dislike in this game. Hopefully in the future, Komoney can fix the flaws present in Master Duel to have it reach a new level of standards.",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 2, 2023"

Win conditions these days involve going first, and special summoning a field of heavy hitting monsters with various effects that negate anything your opponent plays. The player going second, loses before they even get to play a card.

The game makes no concessions for new players, you will be dumped in with very little explanation, no ability to pause the game, and a 300 second timer to understand what your opponent is doing, make your plays and complete your turn.

Diplomacy might sound like it's just combat, but with a different name, but it is not so. Combat works as you'd expect from other games in the genre. Diplomacy, however, functions fundamentally different and has potentially multiple arguments you need to deal with, while also potentially dealing with or ignoring the ""side objectives"". It's a refreshing mode and you often get to choose between combat or diplomacy.

This also features more choices than usual for this genre. Usually these choices end up making someone love or hate you, which can provide different benefits.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 24, 2023"

Visual (8/10) I like general sci fy design and drawing characters, but card design a bit average, for example in battle deck you can find a lot of card with same dagger, also after upgrading cards they will have same picture and same design, so you need to double check description, for card game is a minus. Also music is average and almost don't change in different locations. Interface is very important in card games. So my first impression was - emm another one messy over headed interface, but after some games I can say that it's very helpful, you just need to get used yo it.

Gameplay (8/10) Gameplay is very addictive because you constantly upgrade your perks, cards, get new one and you can check different playstyles through one party. Great Idea to have more playable characters with different styles and story missions. On the other hand not so many perks are really unique and main strategy is pretty straightforward.

Story (7/10) Story is pretty average, but I really like characters. And the fact that to know full picture you need to play this game more than one time. I think that all sci-fi lovers can fnd some references to different universes.

So all in all, I like this game and still have it installed on my PC, so I can play it time to time. I definitely can recommend this game to everyone, neither you are big fan of card game, or just want to start your journey.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 8, 2022"

Cuphead,268910,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Indie",johko,"For years I had been eyeing the infamous Cuphead, the notoriously difficult run-and-gun platformer that made everyone throw their hands up and say ""this game is hard."" I was never all that into run-and-gun games – the only ones I enjoyed were I Wanna Be the Guy and Valorant (hah). Megaman wasn't really my thing and I always associated the run-and-gun genre with confusing hitboxes and awkward controls. I knew that Cuphead was visually stunning -- I could never stop looking at it – but I just wasn't sure if it was fun. Still, its reputation of being a truly difficult game drew me in and I gave it a shot. And it's fun. Really fun.

I'm not good enough of a writer to give Cuphead the praise it deserves in the art and sound department. It's a masterpiece. Tasteful, clever, delightful, pristine, maybe even flawless – these words come to mind when I think about what Cuphead looks and sounds like. But you knew that because you've seen the trailer and the promotional art and probably also watched some streamer or Youtuber play it. So read on to learn more about how the game actually plays.

One aspect of the game that I didn't expect to enjoy so much and also enjoy more and more as I play the game is the customizable loadout feature of the game. Being able to switch weapons, ultimate abilities, and charms seemed unnecessary at first, complicating what could have been an elegantly simple game. But I had so much fun switching out my weapons and abilities to suit my playstyle for each level that I can't imagine playing Cuphead any other way.

One of the coolest things about Cuphead is the strategic element. Make no mistake: Cuphead is first and foremost a skill-based game. You won’t be able to “strategize” your way up to the Devil if you don’t have some basic platforming skills, at least not on “regular” mode. However, I’d venture to say that you’d have an almost equally difficult time if you don’t use your brain. I went into Cuphead expecting it to be a muscle-memory trainer in that I’d just play each level that was impossibly difficult over and over again until my fingers somehow learned how to dodge every attack and get the win. But I noticed that I could make a boss considerably easier just by studying the patterns and strategizing the most optimal moves. Where are the safest areas of the screen? When is the best time to switch weapons to maximize damage? Should I hang up in the upper portion of the screen to lob torpedoes or hang back to preserve my life? I found that I could magically make certain sequences that initially seemed impossible into cakewalks just by playing smart. And that is not a bad thing. Cuphead is not only an action-packed finger gym but also a game about experimentation and creative thinking.

Now, I'm going to start nitpicking. My main gripe about the actual gameplay of Cuphead is the frustrating RNG projectile moments. If projectile A is coming at me and I jump to evade it... and projectile B launches while I'm still in my evasion arc from projectile A and collides with me, I get frustrated. Now, you might just tell me to ""get good"" or whatever because there are probably Cuphead-heads out there that can 100% the game without taking a tick of damage but at my level, I have definitely felt robbed of my life just due to bad luck. It’s not a big problem, and I get why the RNG is in there but that didn’t make it any less frustrating.

Another small detractor from the game was the order of difficulty. Maybe I found a style of gameplay that made certain bosses easier, but I felt that some bosses were way out of order in terms of difficulty. Not a huge gripe, but why is the Devil easier to beat than some of the earlier bosses?

All-in-all, I love Cuphead. My plan for this game was simply to beat it so I could tell people that I beat Cuphead. I didn’t need all the perfect scores or anything like that, I was never one to be attracted by the idea of 100%-ing a game. I was going to beat it once, write this review, and be done with it. But I’m still playing. I can’t stop. I don’t know what I’ll do if I stop playing this game.

Bağımsız bir ekip olan Tour De Pizza’nın ilk büyük projesi Pizza Tower, oldukça hızlı tempolu bir 2D platform oyunu. Platform türündeki diğer yapımlar arasında bile kendine özgü bir yer edinen Pizza Tower, yalnızca platform oyunu hayranlarını değil, her türden oyuncuyu kolayca kendine çekebilecek bir yapım.

Oyunda Türkçe dil desteği yok ancak zaten metin miktarı yok denecek kadar az olduğundan bu bir sorun oluşturmuyor.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Peppino Spaghetti adındaki İtalyan restoran sahibi, borçları nedeniyle dükkanını kapatmak zorunda kalır. Bu borçları ödeyebilmek için ise Pizza Tower’a girer. Yani hikâye oldukça basit ve oyunun da hikâye anlatımına önem vermemesi, bunu bir sorun olmaktan çıkarıyor.
Oyun yapısı şöyle ilerliyor: Her katta 4 bölüm bulunuyor. Bu bölümlerden kazandığınız paralarla bir boss odası satın alıyorsunuz. Boss’u yendiğinizde bir sonraki kata geçiyorsunuz. Döngü bu şekilde devam ediyor. İlk bakışta metroidvania havası verse de aslında oldukça bölüm bölüm lineer bir ilerleyişi var.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Pizza Tower genel olarak basit ama akıcı bir oynanışa sahip. Bir saldırı tuşunuz, bir zıplama tuşunuz var. Zıplarken saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “slam attack”, yukarı doğru saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “jump attack” yapıyorsunuz. Oyunu özel kılan en önemli mekanik ise koşu tuşu. Bu sayede hızlanarak hem parkuru çok hızlı geçebiliyor hem de hızlanma ile gelen mini mekani̇kleri kullanarak basit kontrolleri çok daha çeşitli hâle getirebiliyorsunuz. Kısacası: Öğrenmesi kolay, ustalaşması zor.

Savaş mekaniği de basit. Ana amaç hızlı ilerlemek olduğundan düşmanlar, neredeyse “yürüyen tuzak” gibi. Yeterli çeşitlilikleri var ve boss’lar dışında tüm düşmanlar tek vuruşta ölüyor, böylece tempoyu bozmuyorlar.

Boss savaşları ise şaşırtıcı derecede başarılı. Her boss’un iki fazı var. İlk fazda 4-5 farklı saldırı kullanıyorlar, ikinci fazda ise hem bu saldırılar hızlanıyor hem de sahaya ekstra düşmanlar ekleniyor. Sonuç: kaotik ama keyifli dövüşler.

Keşif elementleri üçe ayrılıyor: 10 dolar veren kafesler , üç gizli mini oda , önce anahtarını bulup ardından girebileceğiniz gizli oda. Kafesler ilerleme için zorunlu, diğerleri ise tamamlanma yüzdesini ve bölüm puanınızı artırıyor.

Basit yapısına rağmen, sadece bu koşu mekaniğiyle bile oyunun bu kadar eğlenceli olması , sadece belirli bir şeyi güzel yapmanın bile bazen yeterli olacağına kanıt niteliğinde.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun, elle çizilmiş hoş cartoon gibi bir sanat tarzına sahip. Mizahi tonu, karakter tasarımları ve bölüm dizaynıyla uyum içinde. Ortam tasarımları hem eğlenceli hem de tema ile bütünleşmiş.

Müzikler ve ses efektleri beklentinin üzerinde. Her parça, oyunun enerjik temposuna uyum sağlıyor. Sesler ise hem mizahı hem de atmosferi destekleyici.

️️Teknik Durum ve Performans️️

Teknik açıdan kusursuz. Hiçbir hata, bug veya optimizasyon sorunu yaşamadım.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

 Oldukça hızlı ve eğlenceli oynanış
 Kaliteli boss tasarımları
 Mükemmel sanat tarzı
 Güzel mizah
 Harika ses ve müzikler

Pizza Tower, türündeki çoğu oyundan ayrılarak herkesin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım. Zorluğu aşırı değil ama kolay da sayılmaz. Bundan rahatsız olanlar uzak durabilir. Ancak farklı ve enerjik bir deneyim arayan herkesin denemesi gereken bir oyun.

Pizza Tower,1070560,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,ScrempBootyCall,"I didn't really want to play Pizza Tower at all because I thought it looked gross, but I promised my friend that I'd play it if they played Ghost Trick and here we are. The game does look gross but in like a sick nasty radical way. It is astounding how good it feels to move fast in this video game and I don't understand how Sonic couldn't do this for 25 years. Every part of Peppino's arsenal feels specifically made to make going fast feel like you just had intercourse in a sick nasty radical way. I love his dives and his different speedy punches they're really fun. I used to hate little things about Peppino's moveset like the way he dashes and the different ways that he throws enemies, but the more I play the game the more I am just infatuated with the way he does everything. It might be my favorite game to control behind Celeste it is so insanely good.

The animation is so incredibly amazing. If you hold down the taunt button Peppino just starts busting it down sexual style and that's chill. I love the little Tv in the top right that shows little buddy and how much character it gives him. I'm usually not paying attention because of how fast he is going but every so often I'll take a little peaksie up at the screen and this jokester will be making a very funny face! John Gutter is so fugly that it won't seem like it at first but every single other stage is an absolute feast to the eyes.

Speaking of the stages, it is amazing what lengths that they've gone to making every single one so unique. One stage you'll be running through the desert into a UFO and then you're going to space and then you're at the whims of Mort the Chicken from the hit game Mort the Chicken on the PS1 and then you're in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria and then you are in war it is so fun. A big part of the stages that I love is that the devs are not afraid to make a gimmick to fit a stage and keep it in the stage. I love Mort the Chicken as much as the next guy but I don't think he would really fit any other stage in the game, and he doesn't need to.

When I first played this game it was a very low 8 out of 10, then after a bunch of time playing it was a 9 out of 10, and at the very moment everything finally clicked it became one of the easiest 10 out of 10s that I have ever experienced.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 9, 2025"

The running animations are very cringeworthy. The pizza guy always makes incredibly cringeworthy faces. To make matter worse, there is a stupid TV on the right-top corner where the pizza guy makes even cringier faces. When you pass a level, there is music that is extremely cringeworthy. It is over-exaggerated and tries too hard to be upbeat in a pathetic attempt at making players excited when they win. It didn't make me excited in the slightest. All this cringe made me grab my monitor and slam it against the floor out of frustration. There is no multiplayer, but I didn't expect one at a cheap price. Did I say cheap? The greedy developers are charging $20 for a flash game. I immediately refunded this garbage after nearly 2 hours. I don't want to torture myself any further with this garbage. Besides, there are plenty of free flash games on the internet. I don't recommend this game at all, unless you like looking at cringeworthy faces literally every second. ● P.S. I originally wrote this review back in early 2023, so that's when it ranked #1 on Steam and I had to see what all the fuss is about. All the crazy things that happened to me this summer made me realize it's best for me to just quit gaming altogether. College Football 25 would've been my last review. I have 0 faith on these lazy and greedy devs, so that was the plan. But after the deletion of this review, I'll postphone my departure. I'm not letting you toy-collecting millennials get away with controlling the narrative, and I'll let these devs know why it's a mistake to listen to you. I'll make sure they develop a highly successful $70 game (regardless if I like it) that will trigger the nerds, before I quit gaming for good. Anyways, I slammed my monitor because of this game.

Devolver çatısı altındaki bağımsız stüdyo Sabotage’ın ilk oyunu olan The Messenger, 8-bit , 16-bit retro tarzında ninja temalı bir platform oyunu. Özellikle Celeste tarzı zorlu platform oyunlarını sevenlerin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Ninja köyümüzde sakin bir gün geçirirken şeytanlar saldırıya geçer. Tam her şey bitecek derken, Batının Kahramanı ortaya çıkar ve saldırıyı durdurur. Ardından bize bir parşömen vererek bunu dağın tepesindeki Üç Bilge’ye ulaştırmamızı, dünyanın kaderinin buna bağlı olduğunu söyler. Biz de bu yolculuğa çıkarız. Kısaca bu şekilde , oldukça basit görünen bir hikayesi var.

Oyun, başlangıç , final ve arada görünen minik sinematikler dışında hikâyeyi pek doğrudan anlatmasa da çevresel detaylarla derinleşen, özenle kurgulanmış bir yapıya sahip. Klasik bir kahramanlık hikâyesi gibi görünse de, aslında çok daha farklı , şaşırtıcı ve derin bir yöne evriliyor.

Oyunda bir “sahte son” bulunuyor. Gerçek sona ulaşmak için tüm collectible’ları toplamak gerekiyor. Ancak bu, diğer oyunlarda olduğu gibi sadece küçük bir ek sahneyle bitmiyor; oyunun içinde mantıklı bir şekilde açıklanıyor ve tatmin edici bir şekilde işleniyor. Bu yüzden 'sahte son' ve 'gerçek son' olarak 2 farklı sonun varlığı bu oyun içerisinde oldukça mantıklı bir hale açılıyor.

Harita tasarımı, başlangıçta lineer tarzda olsa da oyunun ilerleyen kısımlarında metroidvania tarzına dönüşüyor. Başlangıçta geçtiğimiz her yerden yeni bölgeler açılınca sanki yeni bir oyunu oynuyormuşsunuz hissi veriyor.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyuna başladığında oldukça basit bir side scroller aksiyon platform oynadığınızı hissettiren bir oynanışa sahip oyun. Genel olarak mekaniksel derinliği oldukça sıradan oynanışı basit bir yapım gibi. Bu açıdan oyunun oldukça basit ve öğrenmesi kolay bir oynanışı olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Ama oyunun ikinci yarısından sonra , oyunun mekaniklerinin zirve noktasına çıkmasıyla birlikte oldukça Celeste seviyesinde kaliteye sahip bir platform oyunu oynadığınızı hissediyorsunuz. Yani kolay başlayan ama mekaniksel olarak fazla gelişen bir yapısı olduğu söylenebilir.

Başta dediğim gibi oyunun gerçek sonuna ulaşmak için belirli şeyleri toplamamız gerekiyor. Bu toplama işlemi ise Celeste'teki özel bölgeler ve çilekler mantığında. Normal oyundaki platform oldukça ortalama zorlukta iken bu toplamamız gereken item'ları almak için yapmamız gereken platformlar oldukça zor ve oyunun mekaniksel derinliğini uç noktalara kadar kullanacak şekilde dizayn edilmiş.

Harita tasarımı başta oldukça sade , sadece aralarda gizli odalar bulduğun gizli odalarla ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra metroidvania'ya dönen bir yapıya evriliyor ve oyunda daha önce gittiğiniz her bölgeden yepyeni bölgeler ortaya çıkıyor.

Düşman çeşitliliği az ama yerinde. Gereksiz sayıda düşman yerine, platform tasarımını öne çıkaran bir denge tercih edilmiş. Her bölgenin kendine özgü teması var ve çoğu bölümün sonunda kaliteli, çok aşamalı boss dövüşleri bulunuyor. Bu boss'ların kalitesinin oldukça üst seviyede olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Hepsi genel olarak 2 ya da 3 faza sahip şekilde tasarlanmış ve birbirinden tamamıyla farklı tarzda boss'lar.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun kendine özgü çok güzel bir sanat tasarımı kullanmış. Oyunun başında oynadığımız karakter ile oyun 8-bit eski tarzda ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra oyun karakteri 16-bit tarzla değişen bir şekilde tasarlanmış. Böylelikle çok güzel bir görüntü çeşitliliği ve kendine haslık yaratılmış. Zaten retro havasını oldukça benimseyen bir yapı olduğundan animasyonlar ve genel tasarım oldukça buna bağlı kalmış ama aynı zamanda modernliği de hala kendinde barındırmakta.

Müziklerin oldukça kaliteli olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Her bölgeye özel birden fazla müzik bestesinin yapıldığı ve hepsinin belirli bir kalite seviyesinin üstünde olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

Oyunun en iyi yaptığı şeylerden biri mizah. Mizah ise oyunun en güçlü yanlarından biri. Dördüncü duvarı sık sık kıran, absürt ve kendini ciddiye almayan bir anlatımı var. Cidden çok özel bir yapım.

Çok Oyunculu ve Ek İçerikler 

Oyun bittikten sonra bedava olacak şekilde 3 boss dövüşünün ve 2 farklı bölgenin eklendiği bir DLC'ye sahip. Bu DLC genel olarak oyunun yaptığı seviyede bir kaliteyi korurken aynı zamanda kendine özgü ana oyunda hiç görmediğimiz çok mükemmel mekaniksel değişiklikler de getirmiş.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

Oyunun son yarısının aşırı üst seviye olması
Güzel evrimleşen bir platform
Oldukça fazla karakter gelişimi
Kaliteli müzikler
Oldukça komik ve kaliteli mizah

Oyunun ilk yarısının oldukça ortalama kalması
Oyunun metroidvania'ya dönmesinden sonra önceden geçtiğimiz yerleri tekrar tekrar dolanma gereksinimi

The Messenger, Celeste seviyesinde kaliteli bir platform deneyimi sunarken, kendine has mizahı , mekanikleri ve sürprizleriyle öne çıkıyor. Oynayan herkesi memnun edecek özel bir yapım. Kesinlikle tavsiye ederim.

But oh boy does this game feel different. First, let's begin by what really matters : gameplay. This game is really fluid, with quick but still precise movement. The characters are a masterpiece of design, with their own sense of humour, quite absurd yet very effective. The time travel mechanic, with this completely different 16-bit style is a great game mechanic, that allows for exciting challenges. The Metroidvania part where the levels that you got through in a classic left-to-right 2D platformer show much more depth is a great idea, although some may find it a bit repetitive. And finally, the OST. Probably one of my favorites OST, with this 8-bit style music that where most songs ended up on my playlist. The NewGame+ mechanic also allows for some replayability if you really enjoy the game.

Esto puede sonar a extensión artificial. Pero es que aquí reside el núcleo y mejores partes del **** exploración que se luce The Messenger es una barbaridad. Recorrer los mundos es una gozada (gracias a las anteriormente mencionadas mecánicas de movimiento y controles) y realmente sientes que hay muchas cosas por hacer en zonas que son realmente pequeñas. Los sellos de poder, por ejemplo, expanden la exploración una barbaridad y nos permiten tener retos más difíciles apartados de la historia principal. Pero de la mecánica principal que quiero hablar es de los viajes en el tiempo.Estos nos permiten alternar entre los 8 y 16 bits (cosa que le da un toque cómico al juego) y así cambiar el entorno en el que estamos. Esto al principio no se nota mucho, pero la mecánica se desarrolla muchísimo a lo largo del juego, basando muchos puzzles del entorno solo en cambiar de tiempo para poder avanzar o teniendo hasta mecánicas únicas en una línea que no hay en la otra. Donde más me han gustado las ideas a mí ha sido en el futuro. Siento que hay más variedad de jugabilidad, las boss-fights son sobresalientes y tiene mecánicas únicas que lo hacen diferente.Audiovisualmente, es un 10. El juego visualmente es incrreíble, tanto en el estilo de 8 como en el de 16, ofreciendo un diseño de zonas, enemigos, personajes y de todo. Pero es que ya la banda sonora de este videojuego no tiene ningún tipo de sentido. No entiendo cómo alguien puede hacer temazo tras temazo y encima dos versiones y que todas queden bien. Es una barbaridad. Encima mientras juegas, es como volver a los 80/90. Increíble.Narrativamente, es donde me parece que más flojea The Messenger. No está mal y de hecho la trama me ha gustado bastante, pero cómo se cuenta la historia es un poco raro. Sí que es verdad que los personajes están muy bine hechos y tiene un humor bastante bueno, pero la historia se concentra sobre todo en el final, haciéndolo un poco extraño. Aunque lo compensa también con pequeñas historias que están bien. Está lejos de ser malo en este apartado, pero simplemente, es donde peor está el **** resumen, The Messenger es una obra maestra moderna. Que no te deje engañar ese estilo simple y de los 80 o te parezca que va a ser un juego retro, porque estás ante una carta de amor al medio y a los juegos clásicos, que sabe innovar en lo suyo y ofrecer un juego diferente y divertidísimo que te enganchará hasta que te lo pases.

- Great characters and dialogues.
- Great idea of platformer then mutating into mild Metroidvania.
- Weapons - not many but effective.
- Mechanics mostly are intuitive.
- So many Easter Eggs about previous franchises and games (Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads at least).
- Friendly to achievement seekers.
- Special secret areas.

Cons.:
- I hated that ""hit"" jump. Why didn't do normal double jump? Because of that some seal areas are quite annoying.
- Phantom and Muse - I found these names quite lame for the characters. But it's personal thing.

Gameplay provides player with a huge variation of colorful and challenging level, yet there’s a casual mode, but I find original difficulty fair and giving player a satisfaction upon defeating a boss or difficult level.
Unfortunately I cannot say something like that about lore or story, the only thing I can say it **** it only serves as justification of gameplay.
Soundtrack is consists of lots of cool songs from some famous musicians such as Bossfight, Chipzel, Nitro Fun, Shirobon and **** the soundtrack is magnificent.

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DragonHeart000,"I first heard about this game from a YouTuber I watch on his Favorite Game Animation of 2018 video. When I saw it there I found it kinda interesting, how can a 2d game with just simple shapes be considered one of the best-animated games of the year? I looked a bit more into the game and figured the concept seemed fun and it had some songs I like so I bought it to give it a try and boy was it worth it.

First off Just Shapes & Beats 100% deserved that spot on New Frame Plus's video. The animations are sublime. You'd never expect to see simple shapes convey such personality but Berzerk Studio does it so well! Everything in the entire game is just loaded with personality and creativity to the point that you can just get a feel for the dev team behind it and how much they enjoyed it themselves.

The only negative note I have on it is that my typical rule of thumb is that I get 1 hour per $1 I spend but in this game, I beat story in 4 hours. Typically this would make me more hesitant to recommend but with how beautifully crafted it is I am totally fine with letting this one issue slide. This issue could also be taken care of if the devs release a way to make custom maps, this would become one of my most played games if that was a thing.

Unrailed,1116740,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LT_Gruber,"Fun game with fresh concept.

(Played via Remote Play)

There are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. However, Unrailed! has something unique. You need to transport a train from point A to point B, while completing the tracks under its wheels. 

You need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. The multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task.

After each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. However, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track.

When your little train crashes, it is game over. All progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. 

Unrailed! uses simple, ""Minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. The character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving.

The sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background.

Control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn.

It is one hundred percent not for the faint-hearted and it requires perseverance. You will die... a lot. However, you don't start completely from scratch. A problem a lot of people might have with the game is that it forces you to change your weapons. I like some weapons better than others. As I said, this game is not for the faint-hearted. But if you are faint-hearted and you already got it, here's some things to remember before you commit to hating the game:Even if you have your favourite weapon, it will slowly become less and less powerful as you go on. The further you go, the more powerful the enemies and items are, the items you have become relatively weaker. You can still find stronger versions of your items later on, don't get too **** can't choose all of the scrolls. Sure, the extra health is nice but it makes you much weaker in terms of weaponry. Are you forbidden from getting one or two from the scrolls you aren't maining? No. But just pay attention to your weapons and mutations, which class are they? Mutations and damage are affected by scrolls, not just **** you die, it's okay. The fun is not in beating the game but playing it.

Dead Cells,588650,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",RandomBolt,"This feels a similar game to play compared to PSO or Diablo, when it comes to how you progress.
You get some pre-determined buffs after X deaths and collect cells to unlock upgrades.

What does not look the same is that the randomness aspect means you have to slog through the same dungeons looking for the way out, instead of getting to the new areas fast, as on more classic RPGs. The areas just do not change enough to be interesting.
It is the same type of upgrades scattered, same type of enemies, just spwaned differently.

There is a pretty big lean into increasing difficulty through not restoring your life, which can make this incredibly frustrating. There is not much room in the combat to feel you are getting better, it is much more related to what you pick up and what upgrades you can keep unlocking.

The massive christmas lights also don't help with enemy visibility and further deter from the combat being interesting.

Collectively, this has been the most frustrating game I've played in years.

The bosses are usually way too overpowered and they attack almost continously. I used the Assist mode to change that to my liking so can't complain about the normal enemies. They were a fun breeze through.

The levels became more and more maze-like where it becomes less of a platformer and more of a search for the right path by revisiting the old areas over and over again.

This meant that I had to finish the game several times to see what would happen next, and then start again with an extra level of difficulty. After 1 or 2 days, I'd get fed up, drop the controller and never want to pick it up again to continue the adventure, and it was the same with Darkest Dungeon...

FTL is the only roguelike to have kept me going for more than 135 hours. And it's the one with the least scenery, and no carrot for upgrading your ship post-mortem. It's a game that demands insane creativity and great foresight to optimize your ship and the confrontations. All the elements that make up the game are both original and complement each other so well that it's hard to get bored even after hundreds of hours. The possible combinations and strategies are virtually unlimited, making each game unique! That's why, in my opinion, FTL is one of the best roguelikes ever released.

 The positives

The uniqueness of each game, which forces you to think and find the best strategy to optimize your ship, making every run unique.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,9.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Molok,"FTL is composed of wide variety of possible scenarios that are arranged randomly to create a unique run. Each play is distinct and creates a personal story of individual player's struggle. Here is just another one of them.

I started with federation cruiser. Defying odds I progressed through increasingly difficult sectors before arriving to the Nebula under the control of Slugs. There I resolved a few challenging combat scenarios, taking heavy damage because I didn't encounter any appropriate equipment and didn't really have an opportunity to upgrade weapons in earlier sectors. Luckily I found one more advanced weapon in stock, randomly found earlier. But I couldn't power it yet, needing a separate upgrade. With that in mind I pressed on. Eventually I arrived at a sector that housed a planet with several moons. The slug found on the surface quizzed me about the number of natural satellites orbiting the planet and taking advantage of my momentous distraction stole some of my missiles, drone parts, all of my exp and most of my remaining fuel. With exp gone and without a way to upgrade my system I didn't have realistic way to win future altercations but I pressed on.
I encountered a dangerous ship. I disabled shields using my remaining missiles so I could actually damage systems using my pitiful lasers. All of my shots missed and I without ammo I couldn't switch to missile weapons. I dropped the shields, disabled the weapons, ordered all of doors opened to vent the ship of oxygen and concentrated the crew in one large chamber so they would suffocate. After they slowly and (I hope) painfully died I uninstalled the damn game.

FTL is based entirely on your luck. It is a digital version of Russian roulette. Some weapons, augmentations and systems are just better than others. If you luck out and get them advancing through the game becomes trivial. If you do not it is impossible.
I understand that it is alluring to some people as they like the risk. But I would advise anybody who likes to have any actual agency to stay away from the game.

There are achievements that you can collect and unlock bonus ships. Unfortunately a standard run seems to be at least two hours long and if you die before getting an achievement you don't unlock anything. In that case each minute of your life spent playing is retroactively wasted away. There is absolutely no payoff if you lose. A standard tagline for rogue-lites is ""Losing is fun"". But this game simply isn't fun.

On the other hand soundtrack is awesome. I would say that if you can get it without the game it's worth buying. Just don't buy FTL and don't give it any bump in it's statistics.",False,N/A,N/A,"Apr 24, 2021"

Y después de jugar durante 10 horas, entiendo por qué. Enter the Gungeon es un juegazo que lleva muy bien el género. Ahora voy a hablar en profundidad del juego así que, **** Enter the Gungeon, tendremos que explorar las Armazmorras, unas dungeons de toda la vida solo que tienen como temática (intentad adivinarlo) las armas. Se dividen en varias recámaras, y en cada una hay diferentes enemigos, tipos de sala y jefes. Jugablemente es una locura. El sistema de combate es sin duda lo mejor, teniendo en cuenta que han hecho un sistema de apuntado que funciona muy bien para ser en 2 dimensiones. Al sistema de combate se le añade la profundidad de objetos (tanto activos como pasivos) y de diferentes armas (algunas muy graciosas por cierto) que hacen cada run realmente única. Los enemigos y bosses de las mazmorras (aunque me quedan muchos por descubrir, sobre todo jefes) están bastante bien y tienen maneras muy diferentes de combatirse, por lo que acabas haciendo estrategias para cada enemigo o boss del **** diseño de mazmorras del juego me encanta. Están se crean procedimentalmente (o en idioma normal, aleatoriamente) haciendo todo tipo de combinaciones. La progresión en estas también se siente muy natural, teniendo muchos tipos de salas que se van desbloqueando poco a poco y haciendo que cada run pueda tener algo de importancia, desde encontrar un nuevo NPC o conseguir un nuevo objeto que no habías visto nunca. El hub principal (que se llama la Brecha) también está bastante bien, aunque siento que es un proyecto muy a largo plazo (como todo el juego en realidad) pero que se siente muy bien al avanzar un poquito.Audiovisualmente, está muy bien. En el apartado gráfico, el juego tiene un estilo artístico muy bonito, que aunque sea pixel-art (algo que ya tenemos sinceramente todos muy visto) es muy bonito, con un diseño de personajes, enemigos y zonas espectacular y animaciones bastante buenas también. Y la OST del juego es una pasada. La verdad que tiene temazo tras temazo y me ha sorprendido mucho en este aspecto.Como me queda mucho narrativamente que ver (aunque puedo decir que los personajes que he visto me han gustado mucho y que el humor aunque a veces sea un poco absurdo, está bastante bien) termino la reseña diciendo que Enter the Gungeon me gusta muchísimo. Es típico juego que es bueno tenerlo instalado siempre por si acaso no tienes nada que hacer y te apetece echar un par de runs. Si te gustan los rogue-lites, es un must-play y si no, empieza con este que te lo vas a pasar en grande",True,N/A,N/A,"May 25, 2024"

While the enemy patterns and boss fights are pretty much skill based, your experience each run varies WIDELY based on the items you get. Some items are great, some are just fine and the vast majority are borderline useless and unfun. I cannot express enough how much more fun rainbow runs are, because you can get some cool weapons and items and just experience more of what the game has to offer you. A lot of the time in regular runs I realized I just wasn't having fun because I'd take a lot more time to clear floors and bosses because I had to use the default weapon, or some terrible item and gun and run out of ammo for it. The ammount of times I'd restart a run on floor one/two because I got 3 D-C quality weapons in a row is more than I can remember.
This is not to mention a bunch of hidden mechanics and item descriptions and synergies left intentionally vague that will just result in you opening a wiki to see what it does. We are not on the SNES days anymore where these things would have to be figured out through repeated playthroughs and discussions with other players, there is not much reason to not have these things explained in game on a menu.

The presentation is good despite not being too interesting. The soundtrack is charming i guess, but none of them are anything to write home about.This game's strongest quirk is the mechanics. It's basically a 2D platformer game with metroidvania and rogue-like sauces. Also, in the start of each run, the game gives you an option to pick between 3 characters. These characters have their own class, abilities and quirks. Guess what? You don't control what you get.

It's not like Hades 1 & 2 where you get to put together your own build, combining weapons, boons, and other abilities and you stick with them for the rest of the game. In Rogue Legacy 2, your choices are basically locked in whatever the game's RNG is feeling like. This game does have permanent progression in the forms of upgrading your characters' health, armours, unlocking new characters etc. But the very core of the game's mechanics is still randomly generated. You're not fully in control of your runs.This game is heavily reliant on RNG, which in itself isn't a bad thing. However, it does kinda ruin my lust to 'master' the game's mechanics. Simply because I'm not in control of everything available. Rogue Legacy 2's premise is very arcade-like. Which makes the game perfect for pick-up-and-play whenever you want. Rogue Legacy 2 is a good experience still, and i won't deny that. It's just a very different type of Rogue-like compared to what I'm used to. Of course, that doesn't make this game bad or anything.

The concept of combining 2 classes (or races) is always great and underused in games. It leaves so many potential combos, and surprisingly many of them work well. Each race has their unique cards and combining 2 races' cards leaves some interesting potential combos.

Runs include a card selection after every encounter, as well as 2-3 activities of choice, including various types of shops, recruiting a unit, removing cards from your deck, copying a card in your deck, relics, special events, etc.

There are also ""challenges"" that you can toggle on or off on some encounters to increase your reward, but also difficulty. These can be interesting because the extra rewards is not always worth it depending on the circumstances.

This feels more complex than Slay the Spire and you need to manage which units you put at the front, which units on which floor, which enemies will skip a floor, etc. This is not that similar to Slay the Spire though, as you don't directly control a hero that attacks & casts spells, you summon units & use spells from the ""outside"".

Monster Train,1548850,25.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Early Access",savvym,"Monster train is a turn based card strategy where you fight your opponent inside the train, protecting the Spyre. It's very much like Slay the Spire with extra layers to the combat system. It's also less RNG as you know where you're heading to.

Each run starts by selecting one of two (three in total) superpower options for the champion and an artifact of our choice. There is also a temple (from DLC) which allows us to gain artifacts and various rare upgrades for an additional difficulty.

Our goal is to get through 9 rings of frozen hell in a monster train; that is 8 battles if we get to the final boss.

Each combat starts off with deploying your champion unit against waves of enemies. Most of the time, the enemy boss will be flying between the floors deploying some distractions and joining the forces at the last wave into the combat phase or simply spawn last. Until that time you're supposed to fill up all floors with units and buffs to survive.

The boss destroys the floor once it clears it from our units and it means we have less space to put units and less turns to beat the level. If the spyre falls, it's game over. Luckily, spyre still shoots back so it can serve as a 4th floor well if you've got dazed cards and increase its strength. We can also upgrade our Spyre with additional damage, armor, health and apply dazed to enemies entering it.

The cards have various effects and can be upgraded, having 2 upgrade slots by default. The best part is 5x duplicating double, triple or even quadruple upgraded cards but having so many upgrades on one unit is uncommon. Each unit takes up space in the floor so when they're full we can use magic on top of it, and it's wise not to have too many units without enough buffs because they will be easily wiped out in the late game so there should be a nice balance.

Another great feature is the alliance. We get to receive cards from two races depending on which railroad we choose or when we receive after battle rewards. We can make useful synergies, but sometimes allied cards just do not fit with our main one and only take up valuable space in our deck, but we can still get rid of them.

Between battles, there are events like merchants for units, spells and artifacts, special caverns, duplicate hellvents, remove vortexes and health wells. We can even gain an extra gold. And the best part is, we can preview our run from start to finish, however we do not know the outcome of special events. So it is always wise to first take gold, buy upgrades, visit cavern, and then take artifacts, duplicate and regain health.

Apart from those, we will be able to upgrade our champion 2 more times, once in mid and once in late game. We can have as many different artifacts as we get. They make the run easier in a way.

Early game offers 5+1 champions, starting at level 1. We can also play Daily Challenges which are always Covenant 1. That is where the PvP element comes in. We can create our own runs and share them with friends. Our rankings are saved after we finish the run. We can also play simultaneously with other players at the same time, being only time limited.

In mid game, we unlock the second champions and higher covenant ranks, probably reaching covenant 10 and getting used to all of the races in the game and learning some useful strategies. Now it is about making the perfect decks with a bit of luck from rewards.

We will understand the whole concept of the game once we reach Covenant 20. Upon reaching 25, we gain even more difficult challenges that are usually available to mix up in custom games. The game is significantly more challenging than Covenant 1 and we can even easily lose the first battle with all challenges accepted.

The game has a very high skill ceiling and me as an occasional card player, now only became an addict thanks to this game. I usually gain half or third of the best players ranked in the daily and custom challenges.

There are 5 races + 1 in the Last Divinity DLC;
Hellhorned - high damage multi strikers, rage and armor gainers focused on melee combat.
Awoken - high health gainers, multi strikers and sweepers with abilities to draw more cards.
Stygian Guard - incanters, frostbiters and spell users, low melee damage and starting HPs.
Umbra - unit eaters, lifestealers, damage shield gainers, a lot of small units, late high stats.
Melting Remnant - stealthers focused on resurrecting units and slow stat and gold gainers.
Wurmkin - eggs and worms, echo infusers, focused on making the floors magically strong.

Every run is unique, we can replay the same alliances and get different starting decks and meet different bosses.

There are 3 major bosses and 12 minor bosses; they are accompanied by many heavy and support units. There is also a bonus level with 1 more boss but I only got there once.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 12, 2021"

- excessive animations

- too many animation
- wonky animation
- everything looks the same with the background
- non transparency. You have no idea what card is discarded and what card is gone forever, unlike Slay the spire
- again, unbalanced, none rewarding. Instead of killing some bosses for big reward you just randomly get some broken relic and upgrade by doing absolutely nothing

Vampire Survivors,1794680,4.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Casual, Indie, RPG",LordLoc75,"Vampire Survivors – Review SummaryVampire Survivors is an addictive and deceptively simple roguelike shoot-’em-up where your character auto-attacks through endless waves of monsters, collecting upgrades, evolving weapons, and trying to survive for as long as possible—usually up to 30 minutes per stage before the inevitable arrival of a death-dealing Reaper. With minimalistic controls but deep progression systems, it’s easy to pick up and hard to put down.Developed by Luca “poncle” Galante, this indie gem began as a small solo project in 2021 and exploded into popularity thanks to its affordable price, nostalgic Castlevania-inspired art, and wildly satisfying gameplay loop. What starts off slow quickly turns into chaotic bullet-heaven mayhem, with the screen packed with colorful enemies, projectiles, and loot. Despite its visual simplicity, it’s mechanically rich, offering endless combinations of characters, weapons, power-ups, and unlockable **** game constantly rewards experimentation and persistence. Each run earns gold that you can use to unlock permanent upgrades, characters, and relics, and players are encouraged to explore different builds and gameplay modifiers. Its DLCs (both paid and free) continue to expand the content with new stages, characters, weapons, and crossover content from franchises like Castlevania, Among Us, Contra, and SaGa.Content-wise, the game now includes local co-op, mobile cross-platform versions (with ads), and ports on nearly every major platform—including Tesla cars—and even has a live-action film adaptation in the works.With nearly 53 hours of playtime, one player likened the experience to a serotonin bomb, comparing it to the addictive mind-control game from Star Trek. It’s thrilling, hypnotic, and overwhelming in the best way—though not for the photosensitive.Final Verdict: An exceptional indie time-sink bursting with charm, challenge, and replayability. Highly recommended.Score: 9.5/10",True,N/A,N/A,"May 12, 2025"

The Combat in Hades 1 however was better, well everything about Hades 1 is better than 2. The characters are boring, their designs are horrible and uninspired. 

When you think of these types of gods you think yeah they're going to look awesome! Amazing Armour and styles that fits what they're based on. But nope, bland, poorly designed and for the life of me why are they taking away from what they should look like? 

For example, you have a god in a wheelchair... I'm sorry but what? You're a god, make a new pair lol.

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",Atratzu,"-Quick Review-Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in 2015. Crypt of the NecroDancer combines all the elements of a 2D Top-down Roguelike with procedural generated levels, picking up different weapons gear and items to make your “build”, all the while digging through walls and battling monsters in an underground dungeon to the beat of the music.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: At the start of the game, there’s a cutscene of the first playable character named “Cadence” digging in a graveyard to uncover the truth of her long-lost treasure-hunting father. She falls underground and the NecroDancer steals her heart and forces her to move to the rhythm of the **** Cadence plays through the acts, she will unlock new characters which will have different quirks, some helpful, some not so helpful, for example one character has infinite bombs, and another character can’t attack at all.

Gameplay: Movement is up, down, left, and right, some items require you to tap two directions at the same time, like down + left to drop bombs, and up + left to use an item (The Steamdeck assigns buttons rather than directional inputs. This game is great on Steam deck by the way). You attack by moving in the same direction as an enemy or attackable **** the previous mentioned movement must be done at the rhythm of the music, if you miss or skip the beat your character will NOT be injured however you’ll be at a “disadvantage”. You lose your gold multiplier, and the rest of the dungeon will move around you to the beat of the music, sometimes you’ll miss a critical turn and die because the monster got an extra turn. I have used this to my advantage once or twice… but the game definitely rewards and incentivizes the player to move with the **** experience at the start of each zone was “Oh no… there’s no way I’m going to figure out how to play this game”. Then after playing and dying on the same level for a bit, I’d make progress and get lucky with my weapon, armor, items, etc… then I’d get to the next zone, and we were right back at square one “oh no… this is when I’ll need to quit, it’s too hard”. But I did slowly learn the monsters’ attack patterns through lots of trial and error.

Conclusion: Crypt of the Necrodancer is a good game. I’d recommend it to people who enjoy rhythm games… maybe more so than recommending it for people who like roguelikes. Certainly, it has roguelike stuff in it, but you really need to like the rhythm-based gameplay, if you don’t like rhythm-based gameplay the game really won’t appeal to you in the same way. However, it does have options to make the game easier too, so it can be more accessible to **** you don’t commit to getting everything, you’re looking at roughly 13-15 hours playing the game as Cadence. (More or less playtime will be required depending on how naturally good you are at the game, and how lucky you get on your runs) And if you’ve got the time and motivation to really learn the game you’re looking at hundreds of hours of play. The game is a completionist nightmare, I wouldn’t recommend doing that to yourself… but completionists already subject themselves to that agony… what’s there to lose to a little indie game, right?

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",dogukansapmz,"Crypt of the Necrodancer bir rogue-like oyun olmasına rağmen rakiplerinden oldukça sıyrılarak önümüze orjinal bir iş koymayı başarıyor. Oyunun genel yapısı her bölümün kendisine özel şarkısının ritmiyle hareket etmek. Bu oyunun direk core mekaniği çünkü rakiplerimiz de aynı ritimle hareket ediyor ve biz ritimi kaçırırsak onlar ilerleyebiliyor. Bizim ritmi kaçırdığımız durumlarda kendi saldırı hakkımızı kaybediyor bazen de durduğumuz özel bloklara göre hasar alabiliyoruz. Oyunda 15 tane oynanabilir karakter var ve bu karakterler düz skin'ler değiller de oynanabilir oyun mod'ları gibiler. Mesela birinde sadece bomba kullanabilirken bir diğerinde hiç para almadan oyunu bitirmeye çalışıyorsunuz. Oyunda 10'larca farklı mob var. Aynı zamanda 7-8 tane miniboss tipi düşman ve 5-6 tane ana boss tipi düşman var. Bu mob'ların ve miniboss'ların aynı zamanda farklı skin'li halleriyle de karşılaşıyoruz ki normalde bu durum diğer tipteki oyunlarda çok göze çarpmasına rağmen bu oyunda düşmanların bu skin değişimiyle ayrı mini mekanikler kazanması ve bir  yandan güçlenmesi oyuna çok çeşitlilik katıyor. Mesela 1 cana sahip kalkanlı iskelete 1 vuran bir silahla vurduğumuzda direk kalkanı düşerken 2 canlı kalkanlı iskelete vurduğumuzda kalkanı yerinde kalıyor , onun kalkanını düşürmek için yandan vurmamız gerekiyor. Sadece mob çeşitliliği değil aynı zamanda en dış tabakası dışında tamamiyle kırılabilir haritadan oluşan bu oyunda aynı zamanda etraftaki blokların da belirli item'larla kırılıp bazılarının kırılmaması , çeşitli tuzaklar , 6-7 tane silah tipi ve bu silah tiplerinin de 4-5 tane tarzı var. 10'larca büyü var. Bunların dışında kafana , göğsüne taktığın zırhların ve taktığın kolyeyle yüzüklerin de her birinin ayrı özelliklerinin olması tamamiyle oynanışı değiştiriyor. Özellikle oldukça cezalandırıcı bir gameplay'e sahip olduğundan item'larınızı tam potansiyeli kullanmak zorundasınız. Aynı zamanda bu sahip olduğumuz item'ları kullanmak için sadece ''q'' ya da ''g'' ye basmak gibi değil de ''aşağı ok+üste ok'' şeklinde olmasından ötürü o hızlı aksiyonun varlığından ötürü elinin ayağını dolaşması , yanlış item'ı kullanmak gibi durumlar oldukça zevkli bir oynanış ortaya tutuyor. Oyunun genel rogue-like elementlerini de güzel kullanıyor. Klasik bir şekilde run'dan kazandığımız para birimiyle kalıcı upgrade'ler , sonraki oyunda karşımıza çıkabilecek silahlar , zırhlar satın alabiliyoruz. Genel oynanış dışında arka planda bir hikaye de ilerliyor ama çok da iyi değil zaten ana odak da bu değil. Hikaye ilerledikçe yeni oynanabilir karakterler açılıyor ki bu da ana oyunun setting'inden sıkıldığında minik bir rahatlama hissi veriyor. Rogue-like oyunlardan artık sıkılsam da türün diğer örneklerinden kendini tamamen ayırmasından ötürü oynanış sürem boyunca bana oldukça güzel eşlik etti. Türün sevenine kesinlikle öneriyorum , sevmeyenine de kesinlikle denemesini istiyorum. 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 16, 2025"

I have high hopes for the future development of this game. It combines elements of chance through Plinko with deck-building and dungeon-crawling akin to a Slay the Spire clone, which is as refreshing as it is unique. The enemies are challenging, and the unlockable levels of the Cruciball mode add further challenges after each successful run. In addition, the option to speed up the entire game is a nice touch that helps with the grind. 

Negatives are few and far-between, outside of the normal frustration of difficulty. I may argue that more goblin classes (now unlockable), relics, or more orb types could add further variety to the game, but there is absolutely plenty of variety in the current state.

I made it maybe halfway before I decided it just wasn't for me and quit. I stopped after the underground part, after beating ancient spirit I think. This was my first fromsoft game besides sekiro which is awesome. I did like the legacy dungeons. 

The open world is a time waster. You're really just going from boss to boss. The things in between are either worthless enemies or rewards which, 9 times out of 10 are also worthless. 

That'd be ok if combat was good but I find it boring, especially coming from Sekiro. Mostly stay away from the boss or dodge roll until you get an opening. Repeat until boss is dead. Vastly inferior combat system compared to sekiro. People will just say git gud but what's git gud even mean in this game. I had a lot of trouble against an optional boss, ancient hero of zamor I think, so I left and came back much later and whooped it. I hadn't gotten any better at the game. I simply had better weapons and leveled up. So it did not feel satisfying to me. That's really the whole point of these games, the satisfaction of beating a boss, but Elden Ring just feels like a chore to me.

I gave it 1 star because I personally disliked the game mechanics — not because it’s buggy. It’s an easy game, but frustratingly hard to play. The gameplay is clunky and takes a long time to get used to. There’s no story. No guidance. It’s artificially difficult due to the lack of information needed to play it properly. The difficulty is poorly balanced. The beginner tutorial is a complete joke. Combat mechanics feel outdated and poorly coded. The latency is awful and takes ages to adapt to. I’d estimate you need around 50 hours of practice just to handle the battle interface.

Combine this with some cases where you have to walk a long way to get back to the boss and the game can feel like a bit of a chore at times.

Dark Souls III,374320,29.99,17,solo/multiplayer/co-op,Action,LuceLuna,"До выхода Учан это был лучший представитель СЛ который в принципе и породил данный жанр. В целом игра заслуживает оценки 7, но я поставил 8 только из за того что это культовая игра, теперь о плюсах и минусах. Среди минусов причем для меня очень значимых это сюжет. Его практически нет, и тот факт, что он в данном стиле практически не раскрывается не является оправданием, что игру создали просто как слешер в своем уникальном стиле без надобности для игрока что либо объяснять. Мало текста, мало персонажей, невзрачные пару секундные концовки, всё это огромный минус, для игры которая могла нести в себе оболочку смысла и сюжета, а не быть просто отличной сложной по геймплею игрой. Второй значимый минус отсутствие желания её проходить снова. Почему? А в чём смысл, если сюжета нет и ты не откроешь для себя ничего, что мог бы пропустить в первый раз? НГ+ в этой игре становится крайне лёгким из за типичной инфляции характеристик и уже заученных боссов. Последнее. Это отвратительные модели персонажей. Без шуток, главный герой просто создан быть уродом, как бы ты не старался создать нормального(даже не красивого персонажа), у тебя вряд ли получится. Во первых модели тела ужасны, они не естественны и корявы а лица это вообще кошмар. Самый лучший вариант это надеть броню на всё тело и закрыть это безобразие. Броня это единственное что хорошо сделано в плане моделей связанных с персонажами. Теперь плюсы. Шедевральный саундтрек. Один из лучших в плане погружения и так сказать подходит именно для этой игры на 200%. Геймплей, на первом заходе сложновато, но это также зависит от типа оружия, которым ты решишь проходить. Класс очень решает. Теперь графика, в целом она устарелая, но люди которые занимались конструированием дворцов, замков, архитектуры скульптур, они реально гении.

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,SzeBBe,"If there’s even a hint of Soulslike appreciation in a player, it’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t fall in love with Lies of P. The bosses are fantastic: never unfair, always exciting, and the game gives countless ways to customize difficulty—summons, consumables, or powerful weapon options—so how tough it feels is truly up to the player's choices. It’s often called challenging, but with these tools, the real difficulty is self-imposed. Lies of P gave me that “once-in-a-lifetime” feeling I only rarely get—in many ways, it made me feel the same magic as playing Dark Souls 3 for the first time. It isn’t just a clone; it has real identity, a unique story, and NPCs whose fates I genuinely cared about. The motivation to push through tough moments and the excitement of discovery are both strong, thanks to its powerful narrative. Krat, the city you explore, is incredible—dense, atmospheric, and refreshingly straightforward. I’m grateful it isn’t another bloated open world; instead, it strikes a balance, offering side routes and hidden areas to explore, but with purposeful direction. Rarely these days can a game deliver a peak experience in a tight, focused package without unnecessary padding. The story, inspired by Pinocchio, is charmingly unique and walks a perfect line between mystery and emotion. Choices matter and deepen your investment in the journey. That said, the game isn’t flawless. In the latter stages, enemy designs are often reused, sometimes making encounters feel repetitive or dull. It can be disappointing to see an imposing boss earlier in the journey reappear later as a regular foe. Additionally, one or two of the more gimmicky bosses didn’t live up to the challenge or creativity of the rest. While narratively justified, these moments felt like missed opportunities for more engaging gameplay and broke the momentum at times. Gameplay-wise, it delivers crisp, challenging combat with phenomenal weapon variety, thanks especially to its unique blade-and-handle crafting system. Mixing and matching weapon parts kept my experience fresh, allowing for creativity and making every battle unique. For me, Lies of P is more than a game—it’s an unforgettable adventure that I’m genuinely happy I experienced. Despite these minor hiccups, I can wholeheartedly recommend Lies of P, even at full price. The journey it offers is truly worth every penny.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 21, 2025"
Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,Achraf05,"The game is truly beautiful and stands as one of the best Souls-like experiences, very close to Bloodborne. The bosses are powerful and beautifully designed, and the world is exactly as it should be. There’s only one real issue: the shortcut system. At first, it was well done, but later on, the placement felt completely wrong. However, this doesn’t kill the fun at all, since the save points are perfectly distributed, making it not too bothersome. As for the story, it was good at first but became excellent with the addition.

That’s why I highly recommend it!️️
One more thing for those who say the game is extremely difficult: it’s a Souls-like, what did you expect? The game actually becomes relatively easier once you master perfect parries.

I'd describe it as a story-driven soulslike, thanks to its focus on narrative, the inclusion of multiple difficulty modes, and the fluidity of both gameplay and storytelling.Combat-wise, it holds its own against FromSoftware's best. The parry system, while challenging to master, offers incredibly satisfying feedback once you get the hang of it. It rewards precision and timing in a way that feels genuinely rewarding. The soundtrack deserves special praise—it's phenomenal. Every track complements the story and the atmospheric setting beautifully. That said, I would have liked to see more engaging and less linear level design. While the ambiance does a great job setting the tone, a more interconnected world could have added another layer of depth to **** area that could be improved is the pacing of difficulty. The game begins in a fairly approachable way, making it welcoming for newcomers, but later boss fights—despite their excellent design—feature abrupt difficulty spikes that might feel discouraging to those new to the genre.

The combat for me was repetitive and sluggish and the bosses aren't the best I've seen.  For me the game shines in it's 3 main 'dungeons', and the genuinely scary 'run-backs' to base camp after killing the bosses.

The game is a bit of a maze if you just wander so use the visions or you might want to look up a quick playthrough.

The biomes are great and are designed so that you don't spend too much time in them so they don't get repetitive too quickly.

Everything that isn't a boss isn't as fun to fight though. Mechanics are fun but I try to avoid using the hardening ability to make it feel less choppy.

Dar alanlarda üzerine çok sayıda gönderilen düşmanlar bence oyunun ritmine ve hızına uygun olmamış.

Sertleşme muhabbeti ilginç. Kalkan gibi ama tekrar kullanmak için bir kaç saniye beklemek gerekiyor. Kabuk denilen cesetleri bulup artık o karakter olarak oynama fikri de ilginç olmuş.

Item'ları bir kez kullanmadan ne işe yaradığını bilemiyorsunuz. İlk kullanış genelde boşa gidiyor yani, beğenmedim. Bir de item'lıar belli bir sayıda kullanınca aşinalık kazanıp daha çok verim alıyorsunuz, iyi bir özellik.

A parte de todo lo anterior, no he jugado un souls más malo en mi vida, menos mal que me salió gratis. Parece sencillamente una demo (sin acabar) de un juego, los enemigos no cargan bien, el combate es monótono y aburrido, el parry no sirve de mucho, los objetos y cosas que salen en la pantallas de carga ni siquiera te sirven como consejo o para enterarte de algo, parece claramente que ni lo han testeado, tienes varias armas y no vas a pasar de la principal (la tengo al máximo y el resto todavía no puedo tenerlas ni a la mitad de nivel), las mejoras de los personajes no tienen sentido (porque no son mejoras; hay un ataque que si te conviertes en piedra en el aire haces mucho daño al caer, pero no puedes ni saltar ni caer por los sitios, ¿para que he gastado monedas y vestigios? todavía no he podido usar el ataque) y estas mejoras no se aplican bien (por ejemplo no hay otra oportunidad al matar muchísimos enemigos o no te curas al conseguir vestigios, aunque diga que aumenta la probabilidad de conseguir vestigios los enemigos no sueltan más, etc.), no he visto nada del tráiler en el juego, ni las velocidades de los personajes, ni las habilidades, ni nada de todo lo chulo que parece que promete y además de todo esto, es injusto y muy corto. Está sin pulir, con controles que en mando dejan bastante que desear, controles de cámara bastante malos, esquivas contra una pared que no sabes que está porque no ves a tu alrededor, hay muchos objetos que no son destruibles ni movibles y te entorpecen la batalla (como las tiendas) y muchísimo delay, no tiene nada de profundidad ni en el mapa ni en la historia (no sabes porqué haces nada, no tiene ningún sentido ni motivación detrás, ¿salvo el mero hecho de explorar?) ni con los enemigos (ni con nada), te lo puedes pasar prácticamente corriendo todo el rato y evitando un montón de peleas (son mejores las peleas contra boses que contra los enemigos normales, tienen más sentido). El tema de la familiaridad, que me parece algo innovador, queda totalmente opacado por el resto de cosas (lo pondría como algo ""bueno"", pero ni si quiera). Los vestigios se quedan en cada armadura (o shell) lo que genera que cuando te cambies de una a otra para mejorarlas, te lleves una desagradable sorpresa, además de obligarte a manejar una clase de personaje que igual no es tu estilo y te deja con clases/armaduras a medio mejorar. Para usar las ""habilidades"", necesitas determinación, que consigues al rellenar unas barras tipo stamina en los combates pegando enemigos.... pero si dejas de combatir y no has rellenado lo suficiente la barra, desaparece y se vacía (cosa que pasa bastante porque no quieres estar todo el rato peleando), las mejoras de las armas no puedes comprarlas, debes encontrarlas, pero tampoco sirven de mucho ya que consumen muchísima determinación (hasta el parry la consume, quitando un personaje, el resto casi no tienen barras de determinación y no es algo ampliable, encima esta es una de las cosas top que aparecen en el tráiler, pero it's a trap.) En consecuencia a todo esto, el precio base me parece una pasada y que los DLC sean de pago me parece todavía más basto. Hablando de esto último parece ser que han metido en el DLC una 5ª clase al estilo pay to win. No sé de donde habrán sacado nada para hacer el 2, pero espero que sea mucho mejor que esto. Un juego estilo souls no es un juego frustrante, desquiciante, austero o con mecánicas injustas o limitadas, son juegos que te ponen a prueba y con bastante dificultad pero te permiten mediante mecánicas a tu alcance poder probar diferente modos de combate y demás, pero este no lo hace.

What I got instead was a glorified running simulator with the worst dungeon design I’ve ever seen in a video ****’s break it down: **Dungeon Design? More Like Labyrinthine Headache**I spent more time running around in circles than actually fighting enemies. The level layout is so confusing and poorly thought out that I constantly found myself ending up in the **same area I just came from**, only from a different angle — as if someone twisted a maze and forgot to label the exit. Some sections are so large and **completely empty** that I genuinely wondered if I glitched into unfinished areas. Zero enemies, zero atmosphere, just giant hallways for no reason. Whoever designed these environments seriously needs to reconsider their career.️ **Combat: The Lone Shining Light… If You Can Reach It**Boss fights were decent, I’ll give the game that. But the journey to get to them? **An absolute joke.** You’ll have to run a **marathon-length trek** through those same confusing, enemy-scarce hallways just to get back to a boss if you die. No shortcuts, no reasonable respawn points — just a big ol' middle finger to your time and patience. **Item Descriptions? Nah, Figure It Out Yourself**You want to know what an item does? Too bad! *Mortal Shell* gives you **zero info** unless you use the item first — and once you waste it, well, that's just your loss. No forgiveness, no hints, just frustration. This isn't challenge; it's **bad design** dressed up as mystery.🪖 **Shells Are Cool… Until You Try Upgrading**The Shell system — where you can possess different fallen warriors with their own strengths and weaknesses — is actually a **great idea**. It gives you flexibility and encourages experimenting with different playstyles. Unfortunately, the **skill upgrades are mostly trash**. You’ll waste precious resources unlocking garbage-tier perks that barely change anything. What’s the point of customization if it’s not worth the investment? **Final Verdict: Save Your Time, Save Your Sanity**I spent like $2 on this, and honestly, that feels like $1.50 too much. If you’re craving a Soulslike, **replay Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro**, or even other indies like *Lies of P* or *Nioh*. *Mortal Shell* is **not worth your time**, no matter how cheap it is.️ My Advice: **DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.**Save yourself the pain.

Mortal Shell,1203620,29.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access",KillerBunny,"This takes every mechanic from a soulsborne, and misunderstands them completely.

Leveling: you don't. There are no stats to speak of in this regard, or rather, you start ""level evened"" with your enemies and it stays that way. You'd think this is a good thing, but it absolutely is not.  You have ""shells"" (which you have to find). It's basically a class with extra steps, and you can't develop that class outside its bounds- like giving the no-stamina tank some stamina, or the no-HP rogue some HP.  They're stuck with those stats.

You purchase sidegrades for these shells, of which only half per shell actually relate to combat in any way, and three are universal between shells. Each shell has to have their tree unlocked *individually.*  ""oh that's not so bad!"" wrong. There's only four. If your playstyle doesn't fall into one of these four ideas the devs had for you, you're S.O.L. It also means that if you DO find one that's your playstyle, and you unlock the stuff you want, the EXP resource of the game becomes completely obsolete besides buying consumables.  There is no fear of death besides having to go back to the starting area of that zone.

Parrying: Parrying isn't a normal thing. It's attached to an item you have to locate. This item needs to be charged in segments, by dealing damage. If you don't, it doesn't work.  If you don't fill the segment, it decays.  Half the enemies in the game ignore parrying anyway, because ""they hit too hard"" or -surprise- it was actually a throw attack and you were supposed to I-frame it with a dodge. This leads to healing.

Healing: Awful.  Parrying when it's charged, and consumables you have to find in the wild.  No, they are not blood vials- blood vials you have a max you can carry and they actually work. In Mortal Shell, the consumables that heal worth anything tend to remove the resource that lets you parry. Yes, you read that right.  Healing, removes your ability to both parry & by extension, heal more.  By the way, that resource is also the resource used for special moves.  So if you ever have to heal, you can't use special attacks, because those attacks cost so much of the resource, and your healing just deleted that resource.

Weapons: There's only four weapons. Three of them are big beefy two-handers your character swings like they're just waking up. The only short weapon that swings ""fast"" is dual-wielded, and only does full damage if both weapons in the attack animation hit. This dual attack swing has the same overall attack speed as the big two handers with none of the range.  In addition, all the weapons seem to do the same general damage besides the one small fast weapon, for the reason I just listed (everything has to hit). It's literally just choosing what you want your attack combo to look like, and maybe some consideration to range.  Now, how about upgrades?

To unlock your special move, you have to locate a unique item for that weapon and upgrade it at the workbench or anvil.  You also *cannot switch weapons* without going back to the hub, which you cannot do regularly because there *is no fast travel.* The other alternative is finding a specific item related to that weapon, which is an item you have to ""use.""  However, these items tend to be hidden. That's right, they made weapon switching an item usage.  By the way, that goes for shells, too.

You can't just stop and switch your class outside the hub. You have to find a *consumable* item to switch your class out in the wild (no joke, these do NOT refresh on rest).  If you want to swap out before a boss, since there's no fast travel, you have to go *all the way back to the starting hub* or burn an item.  How bout travel, then?

There's no fast travel from point to point.  There is an infinite use item to go back to the start of the zone you're in and lose your important resource, glimpses, which don't drop on death anyway.  It's literally simpler to teleport by letting enemies kill you and respawning. If you have your shell's sidegrades unlocked, which is all glimpses do, you won't even care then.

Finally, enemies.  Half the ones had throws that'll eat huge chunks of HP, can't be parried, and are long-range lunges.  Some bosses have them and they ignore parrying AND blocking.  There's an abundance of snipers that always stun when they hit you, overlooking fight zones with heavy enemies that can two shot you.  There's multiple ambushes in every zone that are completely untelegraphed, and no way to trigger them early when you DO know about them. There's no dogs, but there's worse- poisonous suicide bomber frogs.  It's actually impossible to hit them due to how the combat animations work, their size, and when they explode.  You whiff high on every attack as they approach, and angled attacks are aimed where a torso would be, but they're on the ground.  Furthermore, they're in thin tunnels, so you just have to accept getting poisoned or burn a poison immunity.

Salt and Sanctuary,937010,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,dogukansapmz,"Giriş

Salt and Sanctuary; Ska Studio'nun yaptığı, oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvania yapımı. 2016 çıkış yapan bu yapım cidden bu 2 türü de kendi içinde çok iyi bir şekilde birleştirmiş. Sadece iki türü birleştirmekle kalmayıp aynı zamanda iki türün özelliklerini cidden aşırı üst seviyede yaparak başarısını ortaya koyuyor.

Oyunun Türkçe dil desteğine sahip olması da ayrı şekilde güzel.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Krallıklar arasında savaşın neredeyse patlak vereceği kaotik bir dönemde , ortam biraz sakinleşsin ve barış yapılsın diye iki krallık evlilik yapmaya karar veriyor. Biz de diğer krallığa prensesi götüren ekibin bir parçasıyız. Gemiyle yolculuğumuzu yaparken gemi saldırıya uğruyor ve saldırı sırasında gemi batıyor. Bu olaylar sırasında bir şekilde bayılan biz de uyandığımızda kendimizi bir kıyıda buluyoruz. Amacımız prensesi bulmak ve her neredeysek buradan çıkmak. Temel hikaye örgüsü bu. Aslında çok güzel bir dünya yaratılmış. Şu an spoiler olacağından anlatmıyorum ama çok güzel bir lore yaratılmış.

Hikaye anlatımı souls oyunlarının çoğunda olduğu gibi çevresel anlatım şeklinde ilerliyor. Yollarda ilerlerken gördüğüm şeyler , insanların anlattıkları falan bilmediğim olayları gün yüzüne çıkarıyor ve olaylara derinlik katıyor. Tabii ki de bu anlatım hikayenin çok büyük planda olduğu yapımlar kadar iyi olmasa da , aradığımız şeyi tamamiyle verdiğini düşünmekteyim. Oyunun iki sonu var. Ama bu olay gene her Souls oyununda olduğu gibi çok minik olayları yapıp yapmadığımıza göre değişen bir yapıda. Yani yapımı değil de varlığı tatmin edici son tarzlarından.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyunun kontrolleri eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen oldukça akıcı ve genel oyun şeması kolay. Ama yeni başlayanlara çok yardımcı bir yapıda olduğunu söyleyemem. Bazı kendisine özgü mekanikleriyle Souls oyunlarından ayrılıyor ve bu durumun işimizi kolaylaştırmıyor. Oyunun genel zorluğu Souls oyunlarından biraz daha az olsa da kolay olduğu kesinlikle söylenemez. Hatta zor demek aşırıya kaçmaz.

Silah çeşitliliği oldukça fazla. Ama genel olarak belirli bir sınıfa kısıtlı kaldığımızdan ve skill tree de kullandığımız puanları yeniden düzenleme mekaniği olmadığından direk başka bir sınıfa geçme durumunuz olmuyor. Mekanikler klasik souls mekanikleri zaten. Stamina kontrolü , dodge , parry , hafif atak , ağır atak falan. Oyunda çoğu Souls oyununda olan mezhep mekaniği var. Bu mezhepler bu oyunda diğer souls oyunlarına göre çok daha önemli yer tutuyor. Çünkü direk sağladıkları kaynaklar senin oyun tarzını etkiliyor. Mesela rahip sınıf büyülerini sadece bir mezhep veriyor kalan hiçbir mezhep sana bu büyüleri sağlamıyor gibi gibi. Aynı zamanda bu mezheplerin getiridiği çok güzel bir mekanik var. Oyunda sandıklardan falan belirli totemler buluyoruz. Bulduğumuz bu totemleri bulduğumuz checkpoint'lere yerleştirerek o checkpoint'in içerisine farklı özelliklere sahip dükkan tarzı yerler açabiliyoruz ve bu totemleri koymamız aynı zamanda totem koyduğumuz bölgelerde bize ek özellikler kazandırıyor. Mesela keşif totemi bize farklı checkpoint'ler arasında fast travel imkanı sunarken aynı zamanda koyduğumuz bölgede mob'lardan düşen itemların düşme oranını arttırıyor.

Genel düşman ve boss yapay zekası oldukça kaliteli. Ama boss'ların kalitesi hakkında bunu söyleyebileceğimi sanmıyorum. Boyutu küçük boss'ların çoğu güzel fight'lar sağlarken boyutu büyük boss'ların çoğu genel mekaniksel kısıtlıklardan dolayı oldukça kolay boss'lara dönmüş. Bazı boss'lar ise zor olmasını sadece 1-2 bozuk harekete borçlu olduğundan bu konuda tam bir tutarlılık sağlanamamış. Zaten oyunda genel olarak boss'ların hasarının az olduğunu düşünüyorum. Ama aynı şekilde bazılarının belirli saldırıları var , bir kere vurduğunda kombo yapıp sana tek atabiliyor. Yani bu konuda minik sıkıntılar olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

️Grafik ve Sanat Tasarımı ️

Başta çok basit bir tasarıma sahip gibi görünse de aslında oldukça hoş bir yapısı var. Genel renk paletinin tercihinden dolayı zaten karanlık hava içimize işliyor. Çevre tasarımı da oldukça hoş. Her bölgenin birbirinden farklı yapısı oldukça belli oluyor. South Park misali karakter tasarımları insanı rahatsız edebilir cinsten ama ona da alışıyorsun. Animasyonların öyle aşırı mükemmel tarafları yok ; yeterli ve güzeller.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

Klasik mekaniklerin oyuna çok güzel entegre edilmiş olması
Mezhep mekaniği
Harita tasarımı
Düşman çeşitliliğinin fazla olması

Map'in olmaması
Bazı boss tasarımlarının basit kaçması

Oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvaniası olan Salt and Sanctuary; bu türün ilki olmasına rağmen bazen nasıl bu kadar iyi olmasıyla insanı cidden şaşırtıyor. Her iki türün sevdalısını da kendisine çekebilecek bir yapım. Oyun beni o kadar içine çekti ki oynamaya başlamamın 3. gününün sabahı oyuna nokta koydum. Bayıldım.

It has an interesting gameplay, a bit sloppy controls, OK sound design and overall has tough as nails boss fights and a over-simplistic story. Its souls-like elements feel unfinished. All of the classes - even the Rogue - feel slow to control, this feels like a huge step-down from its competitors such as Hollow Knight.

Игры серии souls изначально по сути своей были переносом жанра метроидвания на рельсы 3D, очень уникальным и своеобразным но все же. Salt and sanctuary еще раз перевернула ситуацию, она перенесла dark souls на рельсы 2D. С самого начала игра дает понять на что она опирается и вообще этого не скрывает, скорее прямо заявляет, что вот мы - фанаты dark souls и сделали игру под копирку, так как ее обожаем. Изначально я скептически отнесся, но когда влился оказалось что это нереально круто, жанр метроидвания идеально сочетается с dark souls, как атмосферой, так и боевкой. Тут присутствует почти все элементы присущие souls - ковенанты, души, множество разного оружия и брони, боссы и т.д. Ты как будто реально играешь в dark souls но в 2D. Боссы очень простые, проходятся с 1-2 раз, последнего босса убил с первого раза, но возможно я собрался как имба, играл фулл хэви билдом с двуручником и щитом. Основная проблема игра - отсутствие карты, насколько вы можете знать - в дарск соулс карты нет, но дарк соулс это не метроидвания, а тут огромный 2д мир И БЕЗ КАРТЫ! Скорее всего большинство людей сошли бы с ума из-за отсутствия карты и дропнули игру еще на середине или даже раньше, но поскольку я топографический гигант, то я выдержал, люди не готовые перманентно держать карту в голове не перенесут такого напряжения.

As for the combat itself, maybe it could be more ""complex"", but the difficulty is ramping up with few bosses. Overall it keeps the metroidvania's combat style and feel.

The graphics are mediocre mid to upper flash game tier. Forget about feeling something like immersion in this game. The general theme of the background music, if present at all, alternates between repetitive and repetitive & annoying.
Weapon and armor balance is probably S&S's weakest part. Items are tiered from 1 to 5. High tier weapons are awkwardly placed and mostly useless filler - by the time you get to craft tier 3/4 stuff you can already access tier 5, making the former pointless. Lower tier weapons are simply not worth upgrading, unlike in dark souls. Lore consists of RPG boilerplate mediocrity sprinkled with the expected DS references - same for level design. It's not bad, but nothing really stands out as innovative or memorable either.
Combat.... sigh. It quickly becomes cheap and unrewarding - there is only so much you can do in this regard in a 2D engine. Total opposite to the original. There are enemies that pounce you or have some other lockdown (in some  cases instant kill) mechanic if you get close, enemies that have long range melee which you need to evade between attacks ( rinse and repeat) and various projectile attacks. The parrying system is a bit easier than in DS. High HP pools on the mob side combined with limited HP and few opportunities to attack on your side feel like something in between an attempt between a ramped up version of Dark Souls difficulty. Bosses basically require learning of patterns as well as their faster alternates which trigger once the 50% HP mark is reached, making for very drawn out fights. If that's your thing, or if you enjoy spending hours just getting through one boss pretty much every single time, this might be the one thing that will give you some enjoyment in this game. But if you think ornstein and smough or manus type fights felt least rewarding about DS, chances are you wont enjoy the boss fights in S&S because 'fast and aggressive' is the common theme here.
Blending out the copious boss fights there's actually pretty little content in the game. Excusable because there are only two devs from what I've heard but it's another thing that makes the game feel a bit too much like something that evolved from a cheap flash game hobby project. Which makes you wonder why you had to pay to play it.",False,N/A,N/A,"Apr 20, 2017"
Salt and Sanctuary,937010,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Coldest13,"Una auténtica lástima.

Desearía que me gustara este juego, pero no va a ser posible. Salt and Sanctuary solo se ha dedicado a matarme injustamente y a robarme mis merecidas almas; pero el mayor pecado de SaS es, sin duda, el olvidar que SaS es otro juego, no un remake de Dark Souls en 2D.

Había jugado en el pasado un remake de DS para Spectrum, un pequeño juego hecho en coña parodiando el original. Ese remake para Spectrum, aún siendo una parodia hecha por un fan, aportó elementos en su jugabilidad que no se habían visto en el DS original, no muchos, pero algo nuevo metió.

Esto no lo ha hecho SaS, se ha olvidado de su propia identidad, y se ha limitado a calcarlo todo de DS, solo dejando sin copiar los elementos imposibles en un entorno 2D. Además, ha fallado al entender porqué DS funciona, lo que tampoco le ayudó a copiarlo bien.

Es una auténtica lástima, insisto, llevo siguiendo este juego durante años y lo he jugado ahora solo para llevarme un batacazo y una decepción, con todo lo que prometía.

Tal vez, no sé, los developers ahora hagan un DLC arreglando el juego básico y añadiendo más contenido, copiando lo que ocurrió con DS 2, pero algo me dice que no va a ser así, y que este juego llamado SaS que parece un prototipo, seguirá siendo un prototipo toda la eternidad.

OverBorder studio (which is a team of only 7 people, to the best of my knowledge) made a game who's biggest flaw was that I just wish there was more of it. It's not perfect, sure. But the music, atmosphere, and gameplay make for a truly enjoyable souls-like experience.

Towards the end, I was a little disappointed with enemy variety. I think they probably needed a couple more tough later game enemies. Additionally, I was begging for one or two more unique and challenging bosses by the end. The Odur fight at the beginning is notoriously challenging, but I absolutely LOVED it. It was incredibly satisfying to learn the timings and movements of his combos.

Le studio Spiders aurait dû faire un jeu plus court et mettre les moyens pour travailler sur le moteur graphique..",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 17, 2024"
Steelrising,1151340,9.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,RPG,korzychxp,"Please do not be discouraged by the beginning of the game, as it is only difficult and looks unimpressive at the start. The storyline is also challenging initially, but later it becomes understandable with notes, videos, conversations – it’s well done. As a long-time fan of Spiders games (still waiting for Mars War Logs 2 and Technomancer 3!), I must add my opinion. Pros:

- Great music and atmosphere (the first time I see robots with souls). 
- Fun combat, though it gets a bit tedious after side missions with recycled locations (if you play just the main story, it remains consistently good). 
- Good graphics in most locations, mainly urban and underground; the worst is the beginning of the game and the bastille when walking by the river (but I play on low settings) – the river is awful, and what’s beneath it    
- Very interesting, though serious story, definitely has potential for development (despite the robotic elements, it’s emotional, and the historical thread picks up later)
- Huge selection of weapons, fewer outfits, but it's okay    Nice protagonist, relatable, has a cool voice   
- Nice storyline characters (though I discarded La Fayette)   
- Cool feature with the vestals where you buy things 
-  Also like the new options over time, such as breaking walls or the rope for climbing higher (though there could be more of this) 
-  Quite a variety of enemies, but towards the end, you know them too well and maybe four more would be needed  
-  Worth buying the Discus Chain DLC, as it can attack from a distance and interrupts many enemy attacks

Cons:  
-  Terrible optimization, on an RX6600 I have to play on nearly minimal settings, and still, the fps can drop from 80 to 30 in many places. Luckily, I like this game enough to grit my teeth; the worst are a few options including textures, which even on high can exceed 8GB VRAM usage, not to mention ultra, and they aren’t even hyper beautiful; the game also takes quite a long time to load on HDD 
-   Lack of newer FSR (1.1 looks ugly and helps little) etc.  
-  Lack of patches for the game, as if the developers abandoned it  
-  A downside is part of the combat where the enemy can attack even if we attacked them; that is, our attacks do not interrupt the enemy's attack animation, though sometimes they do (probably a paralysis issue); the best is to play with the chain as you can hit from a distance, avoiding enemy attacks 
-   Poor character development; I played as a dancer, focused only on strength, health, and stamina, the rest seemed unnecessary (unfortunately)    
- The first location is a downside as it puts many people off the game and they return it, as it’s not as carefully made; once you get through it, it’s great  
-  Zero game balance; I’m someone who kills the monsters on hand, destroys all crates, so I collect various items and have a lot of them 

And yes. The beginning of the game is as hard as Dark Souls, but you can level up and develop your character, so you manage (I play without assists). Then the game is moderately difficult and fun. However, at the end, I play with one hand. At the end of the game, I had around level 40, weapons upgraded to level 5, over 100 healing oils, 50 grenades, lots of HP. Just any boss I encounter takes maybe 10-15 attacks, throw a few grenades at him, add a special attack, and the boss is gone. And I have so many healing tools that there’s no fear of losing life. I just play the game without major emotions, unfortunately. I play only because I like the overall setting, atmosphere, but there’s no challenge.

And I play without assists, so I don’t understand people who need assists. Really only the beginning of the game is hard (indeed too hard). But then not anymore. Then you have various special attacks, the weapon has 2 attacks, you have fire, ice, and lightning attacks. There’s really a lot of it. Therefore, the game offers many development options, equipment, various attacks, it’s overwhelming at the beginning. But later, when you know how to use it, the game becomes very easy. Really very easy. With high endurance, you also easily dodge enemy attacks and don’t get tired, which is obviously a plus for people who don’t like Dark Souls, as there you have to be 10x more careful.

I would buy the game for up to 150 PLN if only it had good optimization, FSR/DLSS updates, and if the developers didn’t abandon it.

Of course, I hope for a Steelrising 2, but seeing that the developers don’t like sequels to their games, I probably won’t get my **** I also hope the game brought some financial success. Because it’s really not bad. The beginning of the game is off-putting, the story is not understood, the game is difficult to master, and the first boss is also very hard, the optimization is terrible, but if these were improved, it would really be a solid 8/10.",True,N/A,N/A,"May 22, 2024"

Caminar por las calles del París de la época, visitar palacios y lugares importantes como la Bastilla o Versalles, es genial. La historia en sí está bien pero tampoco es para tirar cohetes, pero sin duda está mejor contada que en cualquier Souls, cuenta con diálogos y decisiones que afectan al final de la historia, etc. Y el combate es ágil y fluido, con una personalización del personaje más simple que en un Souls pero que funciona decentemente bien. Gráficamente no pasará a la historia, especialmente algunas animaciones faciales flojean un poco, pero como ya dije la ambientación me fascina y está muy bien recreada, con lo que a nivel visual acaba resultando un juego distinto y bienvenido. Quizás algunas zonas se hacen demasiado parecidas entre sí.

Steelrising drops the grimdark atmosphere in favor of an overly colorful 18th century France backdrop with robots(!).

How these 10 out of 10 morons simply ignore this is beyond me.
The reason some reviewers seem to get overly excited about Steelrising's graphics probably is due to the fact that the big front runners FromSoft have delivered their games with the same outdated graphics engine from 2011 on and all other titles look next gen by comparison.
Steelrising also makes the mistake of putting a $50 price tag on this game. Sorry it's a C game lacking anyinnovation, worth $20 max!

Sea of Thieves,1172620,19.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure",jdmsjmsrscgm,"At its heart, Sea of Thieves revolves around the thrill of exploration and the hunt for treasure. Players set sail across a beautiful, open world filled with islands, shipwrecks, and hidden coves, all packed with treasures to be found. While on these voyages, you can encounter various threats, including rival players who may be looking to steal your loot, or AI-controlled enemies like skeleton crews that provide exciting combat **** shared-world nature of Sea of Thieves adds an unpredictable element to your journeys. You never know when you might cross paths with another crew, which can lead to tense standoffs or full-blown naval battles. The freedom to play either cooperatively or competitively keeps the gameplay dynamic, as your treasure hunts may end in epic victories or heartbreaking **** of the game's most thrilling aspects is the random encounters with legendary sea monsters. You might be peacefully sailing with a hold full of treasure when suddenly the waters turn dark, and the Kraken's tentacles emerge from the deep. Or you may hear the ominous growl of the Megalodon stalking your ship.
One of the standout features of Sea of Thieves is its highly detailed and enjoyable navigation system. Steering your ship is not just a matter of pointing in the right direction and hitting “go.” Instead, it involves a range of ship management tasks: raising and lowering sails, adjusting their angle to catch the wind, managing the anchor, and even patching up holes when your ship takes **** collaborative nature of managing a ship with a crew of friends makes this experience especially fun. Each crew member has a role, from helming the ship to navigating using the map, or managing the cannons during combat. The sense of teamwork needed to successfully sail and survive in the open world is one of the game’s most satisfying elements.While Sea of Thieves nails the navigation and exploration aspects, the combat system leaves much to be desired. Whether fighting other players or AI-controlled enemies, the melee and ranged combat can feel unsatisfying and overly simplistic. The melee combat, in particular, often devolves into repetitive and ""spamy"" exchanges where players simply mash attack buttons rather than using any sort of strategy or **** some players, the experience of sailing the high seas in Sea of Thieves can come with an unfortunate side effect: motion sickness. The game’s realistic ship movement, combined with the rolling waves and constant swaying, can cause dizziness or nausea for those prone to motion sickness. Spending extended periods navigating the ocean can exacerbate this, especially during storms or rough seas, when the ship’s motion becomes even more pronounced.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 22, 2024"

Rust,252490,39.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG",Nonameinmind,"Rust was released to an “early access” stage in late 2013, debuting to a peak of 22,000 players in the release month. As of now, Rust has peaked at approximately 260,000 concurrent players in January of 2025, more than ten times increase. Rusts growth has been continuous, due to the “Force Wipe,” a concept that on the first Thursday of every month they release a big update, wiping everyone's progress, across all servers. Rust is from the development studio, “Facepunch,” responsible for games such as “Garry’s Mod,” a sandbox game where anything is possible, and “Chippy,” an arcade style game based on the mechanics of “Space Invaders.” Rust is a multiplayer survival game, comparable to the likes of “Ark Survival Evolved” and “Day Z,” both of which are also set in post-apocalyptic warfare filled maps. These types of games are immensely popular due to their sadistic nature, taking others hard-earned resources for your own gain. Rust has been one of the most consistent games i have ever played, every single month they release a noticeable update to change the meta of the game. This keeps the gameplay fresh, this in addition to the server “Wipes” makes sure that players will be able to play for the whole month without it starting to feel old. However, this makes Rust extremely addicting, and very impactful on social life.  Rust is based on a post-apocalyptic island, leaving the island radioactive. It is rumoured that the island which all players first interact with was infested with the likes of a cold war, the island was used as a testing ground for weapons and personnel to do as they will. This left it in a state of warfare and an idea of “every man for himself.” Rust is a difficult game to learn, and it takes a long time to learn the mechanics, let alone to gather enough knowledge to be able to take fights, at the right time, with the right weapons and with the right amount of people. In Rust you also must learn recoil patterns along with refining your aim to insure you will hit your shots, without learning you are bound to lose every fight you take. In Rust there is not a definitive end, you can always have more resources, raid more people, take more fights. That's the beauty of Rust, you can never actually “complete” the game, this is what keeps players consistent through the month, chasing a never-ending goal. Since you never actually can complete Rust there is no “replay”, however, there is a concept of server “Wipes”, where there is a set schedule and on the day specified everyone's progress gets reset, just for them to go back and get it all again, showing the true nature of Rust. Rust’s settings are vast and varied, however you cannot modify the game farther than they let you, since its multiplier they must discourage and punish third party programs, especially ones that aim to modify the games memory. Rust is available on Steam, PlayStation Store, and Microsoft Store on XBOX, bearing in mind Rust is not cross-platform since PC players would have an advantage. Rust usually sells for £34.99; this is on console stores and on steam. Rust hovers around a 40GB size, reasonable for the large amount of content. Rust pays a large amount of attention to the graphics, the greenery and the buildings all have intricate details to make them look as realistic as possible, and they do an excellent job at it, the interiors of the “monuments” are all rustic, adding to the feel of a post-apocalyptic island. Rust has a variety of sound effects and music cues, the gun sounds are somewhat realistic, although not the best, the music is commissioned especially for rust and gives an aurora of creepy, scary survival. Rust changes the sounds depending on the environment a player is in, for example in a cave, sounds reverb and appear louder and somewhat inaccurate, while above ground there is a distinct sound for everything and a direction of where it came from is recognizable. This is unique and enhances the player experience, really helps in a survival game. Rust usually does not experience many bugs, every update is meticulously tested before being pushed to the main branch, additionally they have a “staging” branch which allows players to play updates before they are officially released, allowing for user-reported bugs to be fixed and community feedback to be taken before a new update. Rust is a multiplayer game, the game requires an online aspect to actually be enjoyable, other players are out to get your resources and you have to protect them, no matter if you’re online or offline, which introduces a sense of urgency to get back to the game and play it for even longer. In conclusion, Rust is absolutely a game to try if you have not played it already, it has a certain player base who chase the adrenaline of losing and gaining resources throughout a period, making it intense and exciting. Although, I'd be careful about the addictiveness of it, it's no joke how many hours you can pour into this game without realising.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 10, 2025"

Rust,252490,39.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG",DragonulX,"Rust Huh, the game that made my childhood better since I was watching the continuity creators on YouTube back when Zombies were on the map. I ended up playing with a friend for about 140 hours, most of which hours were done on empty servers or done by one of my friends using our monthly subscription initiated servers. Initially, I would have several reasons not to recommend the game, mainly because one of those main reasons is the overpriced price. But instead, I won't do this, because from my point of view, for how many hours I invested in the game and how I didn't feel them passing by me, being the game at the same time and very fun, I suppose they deserved their money. Starting with the worst phases of the game, as long as you don't play on a server made by you, you can't really put your soul into what you created or built on the game. In the game there is the wipe term, which at the choice of the owner who owns the server, can be: weekly, every two weeks, or every month) After this deadline, the whole map returns to its initial form from the beginning without any progress. The houses, your items in the inventory and everything you have mined or collected will disappear and you will basically get it from the beginning every time. It sounds very bad since most players of Survival games grew up with Minecraft, The Forest or Don't Starve, where in these games your progress was saved for the entire period of ownership. But it's not really like that, this only applies to servers officially listed on the server page of the game, if you want to create a server you can keep it for life without giving it a mandatory wipe but it will be unlisted and not you can set it as public, if you want it public you will have to comply with this requirement. It sounds decent so far, but there is another part to come. For you to be able to maintain a server is not as easy as in other games and especially since the game does not maintain the server created by you. Either you use Wireless Lan Party programs to invite others if you have a map and want it to run on your computer, or you have to buy a server domain which is not at all cheap unlike what I was used to do until now. These would be some disadvantages in what prevents its purchase if necessary. (You can have a public server with ""No Wipe"" only if there are no servers with Survival game mode. (example: PVP)In the rest, apart from these aspects, the game is ingenious, and comes to its base with a lot of new features and monthly or bi-monthly **** updates do not in any way damage the game or its image and even revive it every time something new appears because you always have something to do in it, especially if you are just starting out with the game and especially if you have a server with Wipe. The idea is that having a server with ""No Wipe"" you cannot expand your creativity as you want on it, most of the time you end up making a construction with the walls upgraded to the maximum and then you think that you have nothing left to do being that everything you did you did during the construction of the house. That's why Wipe exists, to evolve each player individually and all starting from the same point at the time of the Wipe. Imagine Hungar Games with Unlimited Respwn (that is if you don't play on Hardcore Mode) and with several players all evolving differently and attacking each other to capture territories and get materials from the battle or loots found on Map. The idea is very good and I wonder how since its launch it has not received an award or a congratulation for this complex idea, the basis of which is the community that continues to create and maintain active servers even today after a long time. I haven't really seen any bugs or glitches, the game is decent on the optimization side and the difficulty of the AI ​​in the game is to be congratulated. I recommend the game strictly if you have many friends with whom you can have a Party or Squad for Raids because otherwise it would sometimes seem boring to you and you would want to take a break with the game more and more often until you end up losing your interest completely, so that later to return to it again being a good game. On the music side, they tried to copy different ideas from other well-known Survivor games that have good music, and somehow they came out, but not how the developers expected it to come out. All in all, it's good, but it hasn't received updates with the music packet for a long time and I'd be impatient to see that. There are many things I could talk about when it comes to this game, but many of them end up having a positive impact on the game, which makes the final conclusion I recommend it with confidence, especially if you get it at a discount like - I also bought it by the way. I recommend to try for yourself to understand much more than from this review,",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 8, 2025"

Rust,252490,39.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG",EricReviews,"Created by Facepunch, a group known for games such as g-mod, comes Rust. This PvP survival game pits you against both the struggles of surviving on a stranded island with no escape, but also the threat of other people and NPCs. Rust differs from other games in this genre because of its vast plethora of mechanics alongside a seemingly simple premise: survival.  Rust has a reputation for being a very challenging, unforgiving game, but I believe this simply adds to the excitement. Although it might seem that after a short while, there may be nothing new to do, but the constant fear of losing all your progress to either another player or natural causes is what makes this game stand out, as there is no safety for your hard-earned resources when offline.  This does, however, cause many players to develop severe addictions, with many members of the community gaining hour counts into the thousands.  Rust is well known for its steep learning curve, with players being judged harshly by others based on their playtime alone. The gunplay in this game also is quite difficult, making players memorize recoil patterns for many different guns, and get used to the fast time to kill. Even with the short TTK, fights involving larger groups can last hours at a time, with neither side wanting to leave the battle after putting so much time and resources in.   Many servers also introduce prizes and incentives such as bounties for the most competitive clans to compete for. This leads to the formation of very large groups, sometimes with 40+ players, working together to win money on a regular basis. The nature of the game, however, means that to keep a bounty for long enough to be cashed out, the clans have to stay active on a single server for days at a time, often leading to many sleepless nights lying in wait for an attack.  The gameplay loop can vastly vary in length with some so called ‘wipes’ lasting anywhere from a couple days to over a month. However, even though it may seem repetitive, with little variation on the gameplay, each wipe has many different encounters with new people each time, leading to an enjoyable experience for as long as you make it enjoyable.  Rust is available on both console and PC, costing upwards of £20, and can be played on either keyboard and mouse or most standard modern controllers. However, the advantages offered by keyboard and mouse leads to problems in the console community with external devices such as zens.  Graphics/Attention to Detail and Environmental interaction/Scenery/Art Direction and Style Rust has a reasonably minimalistic art style, but this doesn’t detract from the game's positives.  The sound design for the game is both immersive and reliable, with most sounds being easily distinguished between. Rust can be very difficult to run on lower end devices, and can often crash alongside excruciating loading times, but there are very few noticeable bugs, and with the game being updated regularly none stay around for too long. One of the worst and best aspects of this game are the interactions with other players. While some can be kind or funny, most are extremely hostile, and the majority of encounters involve a stream of slurs through the microphone. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend this game to younger individuals as a lot of the language and threats used are quite nerve racking for less confident people.  Overall, the game itself has many strong features, but the community does slightly let it down at times.",False,N/A,N/A,"Oct 9, 2024"

Troll players in a growing number of matches are using aim, invincibility, and other cheats, and nothing happens to them.  It's OBVIOUS.  People surviving point blank Ultimate atacks, being hit by your entire team and their health bar not moving.  People just spinning and auto locking you when they didn't even know you were there.
The devs WILL NOT actually ban anyone from the game.  You can use cheats, throw, smurf, call people whatever you want using bigoted language, all they'll do is ""limit their competitive matchmaking"" for a while.  They'll just log out and be back later.
All Netease cares about is using the Marvel brand to sell skins until this dies.  They put out 3 or 4 battlepasses to buy, WHILE there is still a battlepass you've already paid for.  They put NO effort into reverse the garbage ""matchmaking"" or stopping the cheating and smurfing making the game unplayable for anyone but trolls.

The smurfing is absolutely out of control and the matchmaking encourages it. NetEase seriously cannot design proper matchmaking or protection against repeated smurf accounts. They must salivate at the idea of high rank players creating new accounts to steamroll low rank players, because they basically ask for people to do this. 

Update: it's still absolutely terrible. Myself and literally all of my friends who used to play this game have quit because of the abysmal, unfair, toxic matchmaking. Good riddance. NetEase, sorry I won't be spending another penny on your awful game. 

Placement matches. Is it so hard to do NetEase? Guess not because 'something something something' money?  This game is already horrendously terrible enough with matchmaking with ""engagement optimized"" matchmaking where it literally puts you with/against higher tier players, but the seasonal rank resets and literally non-existent quickplay matchmaking are the icing on the cake. There's a reason you don't see 'casuals' playing anymore......Matchmaking is an absolute joke, you will never ever have a fair match where you feel like you could've made a difference. It was fun in the beginning, but NetEase scared and chased off all the fun, casual players it had in the beginning. So, all that is left is a shell ****, with only the sweatiest, sweat lords you can imagine. I'd say ""it's just me"", but I used to play with 4-5 friends, daily, for several months.

The writers of lore seem to be initiates into some mysteries. Even some of the fan base, the way they seem to analyze the goings on in Arkesia and Petrania (The worlds of Lost Ark) seem to be of another class.

It is in fact similar to other games as far as the story / lore goes, but it’s not just killing demons (although it has a lot of that too !). Planets and stars from our own solar system, such as Regulus are revered and worshipped, making this game more believable and in turn, immersing the player in the story and game.

From the lore, to the soundtrack to the graphics and character design this game excels.I can hardly believe i took a break for 3-4 months only to play other popular games. To get disconnected every day, multiple times a day. To experience graphics bugs and glitches, UI bugs and glitches each and every **** this only helped me to realize how poor alot of these other popular games are and how superior Lost Ark is.

The steep learning curve can make it feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers.

Dota 2,570,0.0,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Strategy, Free To Play",sakalipsa,"Throughout history, there have been numerous moments where discoveries embody the ""perfect formula"" principle, whether it's fire, the wheel, electricity, Coca-Cola... All of these discoveries or inventions are inherently part of a continuum of refinement driven by civilization's evolving needs through time and space. For example, Chess was played thousands of years ago with unlimited time per move, each piece had very different movement rules and overall rules differed significantly from modern ****, the ""perfect formula"" of Chess itself remains unchanged and will likely endure as long as our cognitive 'modus operandi' remains as it is. To put it more illustratively, these ""perfect formula"" discoveries and objects resonate with us much like corners resonate with spiders or trees and rivers resonate with beavers. Our minds are wired to engage with these perfect circuits in all their brilliance, because the human mind is a brilliant invention of evolutionary processes and this engagement is simply enjoyable wallowing in our own **** such perfect circuit, among many others in different fields, is Dota 2. This game is flawless in its **** course, you would make a logical mistake in qualitatively comparing Chess with the wheel, or fire with Coca-Cola, or electricity with Dota 2, or even Chess with Dota 2 - which is usually the case. Each of these phenomena holds its own utility field, and their disparate, incommensurable states should be considered within their own contexts and frameworks. Chess and Dota 2 may have superficial similarities, but they are fundamentally different, like ""original Cola"" VS ""DIY Fanta"" different, the only similarity might be the carbonated bubbles in both drinks, which metaphorically could resemble your mental engagement through all aspects of being tricky, witty, or cunning in strategizing and anticipating moves of your opponent in Chess, or timing your spells in Dota 2 either alone or in synergy with your... ****, yes, THE TEAM. Damn. This sounds like it's always the same team and holy f, it actually is. The game has SO MANY players and has been out there for so long that it has crystallized a distinct pattern of mentality, which could literally be captured by the term ""Team of Dota 2"" with its own hypostatized face. The community in this game deserves special attention; it is a phenomenon that needs a separate review. Actually, it deserves a psycho-pathological study. It's no joke. It's unlike anything I've encountered in any online game before and I'm not using now personal experience (or lack thereof) as a validating instrument for this opinion - it's an objective fact, especially in recent times where its collective mind has reached its peak form.Anyway, back to the game, some surrounding aspects: I've seen many people discredit it, saying things like, ""Damn, that game seems complex and time-consuming; I don't have the energy to invest in it."" Yet they proceed to play Sudoku or Chess 24/7, others invest time in watching bare-bottom TV shows, some work and provide for their families, others gamble, others read books, etc... Everyone is occupied with something, but the 'rational' fear of this game persists, as if it's a virus that will devour their life like nothing else already does. This perception is completely distorted and based on faulty assumptions. As I said, the game is perfect in its core, and that ""perfect formula"" allows you to enjoy it endlessly...HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you should sacrifice your personality, abandon your character and dreams just to immerse yourself in this sinkhole. I mean, if you're confused about your priorities and lack essential personal values, that's your own weakness and fault. It's not the game's fault if you're inclined to start compensating for that weakness with a dominance-at-all-costs attitude in the game - initially just trying to win every match, and later becoming hyper-toxic towards others. Would you blame a beer company for your careless driving while drunk, or a casino for losing enormous amounts of money?

If you are already individually dissociated and dissolved into the crystallized Dota 2 mentality, of course you would. Noob.

Players on a low rating throw reports just for fun - and as a result, people simply do not have the opportunity to raise decency! Together with the introduction of such a system, it was necessary to at least reset the decency indicator! My decency is 5700 - although I am not a toxic player and try to play normally. You're just killing the game on a low rating and a mid-level rating. Terrible update! Fat dislike!

The game and its dev team had quite the journey in all this time and they did A LOT for their community.

Personally, I've never seen any game developer that poured so much heart and soul into his product, worked so well with everybody else and their community and did overall so incredibly much to stay alive.
Warframe offers: one of the friendliest communities in all of gaming, a deep, emotional lore, a huge variety of approaches for the gameplay itself, tons of missions, endless customizations, earnable in-game currency (you don't have to invest a single dime!), a huge variety of systems and content within the game.) and much more.

If you think you can just go FREE and grind for everything, you WILL SUFFER . The new player experience is realy bad. If you are interested in this game, play it for a while, and then when you get your first 75% platinum discount, make a choice. Either buy 4k platinum with a 75% discount to remove the nonsensical and annoying time-wasting grind for absolute necessities like weapon and warframe slots OR decide that you don't want to make this one-time purchase and leave the game. If you are willing to BUY the starting platinum, it will carry you through the whole game, ONLY THEN you can truly enjoy the experience of progress in this game. Just go read all the other negative reviews; they are all about ""hitting the wall"" and ""repetitive grind,"" which is all caused by the platinum grind that halts your progress; without it, the game is good; with it, you have to pay for the game to be good. Also, everything for real money (not platinum) is absurdly expensive. Everything is bundled up with stuff you do not want/need, like boosters, artificially making things expensive—for example, exclusive skins for 60€, etc. So if you are not rich, you won't get those even if you are grinding for platinum in-game. Lastly the company is woke, and the mods are ban happy. Don't even try to write anything negative or, god forbid, single slur to a griefer in your party; it WILL get you banned. So only play the game, and do NOT interact with anyone in the game; if you want to send a funny message to your friend, do it elsewhere and don't risk it.

The main aim of the game is to kill every other squad, trio, duo, or person and be the last remaining survivor and be pronounced the Apex champion, although to become a champion, the game has a skill-based matchmaking system, so based on your skill level of the game you will always get put against someone your skill level although sometimes it does have its faults, however there is always something new to learn such as new movement which can confuse your enemies however takes hours of practice to perfect.

Apex legends is a free to play game however some long-time players would argue that buying certain skins in the game would highly benefit the player, but the game is free however what comes with this is that apex can be a very aesthetically pleasing game if played on a powerful enough device and high enough graphics, otherwise the game may look extremely basic, and you may suffer performance issues.

Since its launch, the game has managed to maintain an impressive relevance, not looking its age, thanks to regular updates and the introduction of new content. One of the main reasons for Apex Legends’ continued success is its competitive and accessible development. The game is structured in a way that is friendly to new players, with a gentle learning curve that allows newcomers to quickly adapt to the game’s mechanics. At the same time, the game offers enough strategic depth to keep veteran players challenged and engaged, with a constantly evolving meta and a variety of characters, each with unique abilities. EA has managed to find an effective formula to keep players engaged season after season. The introduction of new characters, game modes, seasonal events, and map updates keep the gameplay experience fresh and exciting. This constant stream of new features and improvements keeps players coming back regularly, avoiding the stagnation that can plague other games in the genre. Despite its success, it’s inevitable that some players have dropped out of the game over time. However, Apex Legends’ player base remains robust, with only a small portion of the original audience having left the game permanently.

Apex Legends,1172470,0.0,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",LT_Gruber,"Great Battle Royale game with high tension.

When the Battle Royale genre came to market, I played a couple of them. After PUBG, which I found fun for a while, but eventually bored me, Apex Legends hit the scene and it was an amazing experience.

In Apex Legends, you start in a team (with friends or random people) and choose a character and class. Each class has its own starting layout and proficiencies and, depending on the play style, can really make the difference between winning or losing.

An epic cutscene plays in which you are dropped from a plane, and while descending, you can choose where on the map to land. On your drop, you can also see the spread out other players, so you can determine somewhat how close they are going to be. After landing, you can explore a giant map in search of new weapons, enemies and gear.

Every so often, the playable area gets smaller and running into other players will be more likely by the minute. The tension is great and with each passing second, the chance for victory or annihilation gets closer. In the end, the combat arena is not bigger than a living room in a house and the combat en tension rises to a whole new level. It is them or you.

Apex Legends looks great. The huge map, the forests, the water, character models and color pallet, it is beautiful to look at. For me, the way the game looks, really enhanced my experience and made me choose this game over other Battle Royale games in the genre.

In terms of sound, the game is also outstanding. The glorious battle music at the start, the ambient, threatening tracks when exploring the map, it is just great.

The overall atmosphere of the game feels like a whole crowd of fans and supporters is watching. It has some sort of “Super Bowl vibe” if that makes sense. Sure, players who have been eliminated can watch you struggle (or die) but most move on to another game, which makes sense. Still, Apex Legends has this appeal.

I really liked the overall setting of the game. The action, the constant alertness of your surroundings, finding cool stuff, the adrenaline rush combat when you turn around a corner and the enemy is standing there, and one time, I even won the match with my team and I felt like a God.

The game is, of course, most fun to play with friends and the coordination and teamwork is just great. You are playing a video game, but it feels like you are in the army.

My only personal problem with Battle Royale games like this, is that you find a lot of cool stuff, get one-shotted in the head, and the game is over. This has nothing to do with the game, it is just how it is played, but I always get a little bumped out over building up something cool and strong, and then lose it all in a second.

Overall, I think Apex Legends is a great game and I would recommend it to everyone.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jan 22, 2024"

Drop rates are insanely low and will drop gear for all classes which makes getting any upgrade for your class very hard to come by. The only way to progress is to stock pile items and switch classes when you have enough good items for the other classes because you won't be finding upgrades for the class that you are playing.

Level ups feel worthless as STR, DEX, INT no longer provide major stat improvements. Skills no longer level up. The only character they seem to have balanced the game around is the Warrior, ever other class dies so quickly it's not funny.

Performance wise the game stutters a lot and floats between 40-50 FPS with a 2080 on medium.

I'm so tired of devs labelling their game dank souls because they are too lazy to balance their game and then to top it off throwing in instant death attacks to further ruin the game.

But I do feel that I have to mention that first, due to the image the game has and how much that oversimplification has harmed the game's reputation.

This game honestly feels infinitely more balanced than OW foundationally. OW forces you to play certain team comps, on certain maps, with each character usually having a single viable playstyle with little room to budge. Paladins offers tons of playstyles for each character through options like talents, in-game store abilities (think MOBAs, not actual cash stores), and even a loadout system using deckbuilding to sway your characters skills to your playstyle, optimizing exactly how you play.

Overwatch is such a frustrating experience because of how thin its meta is and how you're forced into certain playstyles and comps. If you don't follow them, you're going to get steamrolled. If you play support or tank and don't have reliable teammates, you're going to get steamrolled since you can't manage enough to defend yourself. Paladins gives you the option to play your role and hold your own when you need.

This game is not an Overwatch clone, it is better. You have options, you're not limited in how you can play characters, and while you probably aren't going to win without solid teamwork, you can at least have more freedom to sway the game in your direction and keep yourself alive by fighting back.

playing this game on its fullest requires roughly an ammount of 180 euros if you want the full fleshed out experience, in a place where doing endgame activities requires a group of people (3 in total for dungeons, 6 for raids), thats rather hard to find in a community that on one side calls the experts elitists with massive egos and one the other views helping new players out a rather big waste of time.
Is destiny 2 worth playing? yes (on pc expecially) despite the downsides a new player has a lot to work with, improving, finding a team/clan and testing themselves on normal and hard versions of interesting raids and (for the more masochist) testing themselves in trials on a pvp ruled by meta ability spam of certain characters, exotics and damn smgs with qa rather **** balancing. (it aint worth it trust me). On a run for normal and adept loot with specific rolls.

Storywhise you have to put a lot of hope on how the story of the final shape expansion delivers, hoping that the season ""battle pass"" ceazes to exist with the following episodes that will be later introduces. the previous ones were mostly mediocre (apart from the witch queen).

The focus isn’t on creating a rich, engaging experience for players anymore, it’s on squeezing every cent out of the community.

La razón principal es que es imposible ponerse al día, no solo por la parte mecánica (he metido muchas horas a Warframe, entiendo que para que un jugador nuevo entre a un juego así y se ponga al día va a necesitar invertir tiempo) sino porque han quitado tanto contenido que literalmente es imposible que nos importe lo que está pasando. Un ejemplo, nos dicen que Cayde-6 está muerto y todo el mundo está tremendamente triste, y entiendo que sea un personaje importante del 1 y el 2, pero como han quitado todo su contenido del juego lo único que podemos hacer es jugar la misión en la que se muere, que falla en tener ningún impacto emocional porque no conocemos al personaje. Y así con todo. Sabía que el vault existía, pero pensaba que habían metido en él cosas laterales, sidequests y demás, pero como han metido campañas enteras, lo que encuentras es un desastre a nivel narrativo que es muy difícil seguir, saber en qué orden hacer, etc. Una de las peores experiencias que he tenido como jugador nuevo en un juego.Y eso que, la parte de combate, las clases, las habilidades, las armas y demás, todo eso es divertido. Bueno, menos las secciones de plataformeo, que son un coñazo ortopédico y parece que les gustan mucho. Pero todo lo demás realmente es muy bueno, y los trozos que te dejan ver de la historia parece un mundo interesante, con buen worldbuilding e ideas chulas. Pero todo eso se pierde bajo la frustración de que la mayor parte de lo que puedes hacer con la parte gratuita del juego es en buena medida irrelevante, carente de razones reales para hacerlo porque no hay ni historia ni nada en muchas de las zonas, etc.Gráficamente el juego está muy bien, el sonido también lo está, y yo la verdad es que me he encontrado muy pocos bugs en las horas que le he metido. Con lo cual a nivel técnico cumple muy **** una lástima que sea este desastre injugable el resultado final, realmente me estaba gustando y estaba bastante decidido a comprarme las expansiones y eso hasta descubrir que en realidad aún con ellas me iba a perder multitud de contenido, historia y demás. Quizás cuando salga Destiny 3 valga la pena entrar, pero como jugador nuevo, la experiencia de entrar al 2 ahora es completamente terrible. Deberían aprender de cómo lo ha gestionado Warframe, que lleva mucho más tiempo de desarrollo, y aún así no priva a ningún jugador de experimentar toda la historia y sus cosas, y gratis además.

Destiny 2,1085660,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",ztokdo,"Despite a rough launch that led to a divebomb of negative reviews just about that, there's plenty of other things that really make you hate it.  
THE FINAL SHAPE LACKS REAL CHARACTER.   The villain is just annoying to see or even hear any wierd ramblings from.  The amazingly beautiful visuals and gunplay are so contrasting to story and overpowered ability spam.   The final shape is a mediocre offbeat soap opera.  The final shape is lucky that no other game is trying a first person live service looter shooter.    

Honestly Zavala, Ikora, and ghost are relatively annoying.  Did you realize that the story mentions some great apocalypse, then the FINAL SHAPE FEELS NOTHING LIKE THAT.  The missions are tedious and have several ""gotcha"" moments.  A lot of time I feel like I'm just waiting for some dialogue or something to just play out.

The best parts of Destiny's past have been the speaker, Cayde, Savathûn, and Ghaul.  All of the world and feeling of complete power that Savathûn had in the Witch Queen is just gone since then.

The ""end game"" still boils down to making the same dozen exotics work.  The grind to get perfect gear and eggballs is aweful. The most recent ""events"" are all based on FOMO and are horrible to play.   I hardly know anyone who could put in the hundreds of hours to complete the 25 lost sectors or 50 runs of onslaught.  The dev team has completely lost touch with their player base.  

Who wants 2 hour long actitives like the recent raid.  It's great for streamers and aweful for friendship.  People get bored repeating fights in a room with wave after wave of stuff spawning in.  The main way to die is to not memorize where things spawn in for their gotcha kills.  

It's going to be the same thing as usual.  Bungie literally gives Destiny expansions and all current FOMO items to all their streamers to keep them streaming it.  This is public knowledge.  In contrast, I keep running into people with 30-100 clears of dungeons and raids without the exotics or main loot.   It's absolutely repetitive to the point that you hate it and has only double downed on that.

If you feel like it's worth a playthrough of the story and not getting the main items of value that it's probably worth getting it for you.  If you are lonely and have nothing going on in life, it's a great opportunity to stay that way and that may be for you.   The final shape really didn't capture a gaming experience and is really hoping that you buy it for nostalgia of what once was a game.",False,N/A,N/A,"Jun 11, 2024"

Destiny 2,1085660,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",LT_Gruber,"Absolutely not the game for me personally.

I did not like Destiny 2. Although my reasons are entirely personal, I just could not get into it. I never liked service model games to start with, and Destiny 2 is no exception.

From the start, I could not care less about the main story of the game. There is a whole universe of lore, story, events, memorable characters etc., but for some reason, I could not give a flying ****. I created my character, finished the tutorial and already felt pointless and bored. Normally I would “educate” the reader of my reviews with a quick recap of the story or main goal, but in this case, I just cared too less.

I played some missions and quests but nothing felt like it mattered. I go to the location, kill stuff, complete the mission, earn my rewards and felt hollow inside afterwards. The thought of repeating this process until I grew to a certain level pained me, and when reaching level ten or so, I was done.

Graphicly, I think Destiny 2 is boring. It is blend, stale and flat. The worst environment with these graphics is the Central Hub location. Weapons and animations look well and polished enough, but the color pallet is just boring.

Sound wise, I think this is one of the worst I have played. Sound effects and music is so generic and dull, and distant enemies do almost not make any sound or grunts at all.

The controls and menus were horrendous and really hard to figure out and understand for me, and the sleek, SQL database design of it did not appeal to me.

Loot was absolutely pointless in my opinion. You get the same weapon or armor twenty million times, but with a different rarity or color. The stats meant nothing to me and I had no freaking clue wat was good and wat was bad. The numbers showed me that an item was way better than the previous one, but when equipping it, I did not notice any difference.

Destiny 2 has a certain “theme/skin/feel” that is the same as games like Anthem or Starfield (in hindsight). It is hard to explain, but revolves about the look of the inventory screens, stat screens, quest markers, etc. It is purely based on the menus and inventory management. For me, that was a problem, because Anthem was one of the worst games I ever played in terms of boredom.

The feeling of a freemium game in which you complete generic missions over and over and over again is just not for me. I constantly got the feeling that I could achieve nothing, unless I pulled out my wallet, although this is technically not the case.

Because the game is “Freemium”, you constantly get confronted with “deals”, “special offers”, “new store items”, and “best values” from the in game store. In the menu’s, at the start screen, at every interactable screen, it just felt like playing a online webstore in a browser. I understand it, because of its model, but I just don’t like microtransactions in games in general and, in hindsight, it is just better for me not to play this kind of games at all.

In conclusion, my own personal experience with Destiny 2 was very miserable. I hated every second of it and was bored out of my mind the second I even started the tutorial.

I personally would not recommend this game.",False,N/A,N/A,"Jan 11, 2024"
