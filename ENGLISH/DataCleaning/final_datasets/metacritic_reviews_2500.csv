Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,H1D1Bale,"The best tactical shooter with incredible sounds and immersive gameplay. Appreciate the game while it exists, as such masterpieces are no longer being made",10,True,"Sep 14, 2025"
Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,Cropac,"Jugué la primera entrega de Insurgency y me encantó por completo. Sus modos de juego, el ritmo, ese equilibrio entre arcade y realismo me parecieron una experiencia única dentro de los shooters en primera persona. Insurgency: Sandstorm mantiene ese mismo espíritu, pero elevando todo a otro nivel. Gráficamente es muy superior, el sonido es espectacular cada disparo, cada explosión se sienten intensamente reales y la jugabilidad sigue siendo su punto más fuerte.Este no es un shooter para cualquiera. Tiene un enfoque más táctico y realista que Call of Duty, pero no llega a los extremos de simulación de Arma, quedando justo en ese punto medio que lo hace tan especial. Su gunplay es excelente, el arsenal está muy bien trabajado, y los mapas y modos están diseñados para ofrecer combates intensos, inmersivos y llenos de tensión. Si encajas con este estilo de juego, es muy probable que te quedes por decenas o incluso cientos de horas. Y aunque no seas ese jugador “ideal”, Sandstorm sigue ofreciendo razones de sobra para jugarlo, sobre todo si tienes amigos con quienes compartir la **** definitiva, lo recomiendo sin dudar por su jugabilidad, por el realismo bien medido, por sus gráficos mejorados y por su sonido impresionante. Un multijugador diferente que merece más atención de la que tiene.",9,True,"May 18, 2025"
Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,MrJAR,"Just like my favorite game of all time L4D2 this game is extremely replayable the community might be toxic to certain people Yes i can see that but I LOVE them I interact with some of the same people here and there and they give me a good laugh. The game gets updates pretty frequently for things like cosmetics, maps, double xp (for account level) it doesn't let the game hang out to dry like what Rockstar games did to Red Dead Redemption 2 MP. The reason i put it as a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is phasing issues when i shoot someone sometimes the bullet goes through them and hits behind them and there's a weird bug recently I've recently got in the pass few days of ground texture being black but it stops when the game is done, none the less if i had 30 bucks and trying to get an fps that will last me a long time, if im looking for a game that isn't COD, Rainbow 6, and im not looking for a game like ready or not/arma/squad, THIS IS THE GAME!!!",9,True,"Feb 5, 2025"
Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,LatvianButter,"A perfect blend of gritty realism with nice arcadey elements that make for a wonderful serious game, and a wonderful 'lets **** around' game at the same time.",7,True,"Jan 3, 2025"
Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,jdmsjmsrscgm,"Insurgency: Sandstorm,stands out in the crowded field of first-person shooters with its intense and realistic depiction of modern combat. Launched as the sequel to the original Insurgency, Sandstorm enhances the franchise’s reputation for delivering gritty, tactical gameplay that rewards teamwork and strategy over lone-wolf **** of the most notable aspects of Insurgency: Sandstorm is its commitment to realism. The game eschews the more arcade-like elements found in many of its peers in favor of a more grounded approach. Weapons behave realistically, with significant recoil and authentic ballistics. This makes gunfights tense and deadly, where a single bullet can be fatal. The sound design further amplifies the immersion, with gunfire and explosions resonating with a visceral, bone-rattling intensity that places players right in the heart of the **** tactical gameplay is another strong point. Insurgency: Sandstorm requires players to communicate and coordinate effectively to succeed. Each match demands careful planning and precise execution, whether you’re capturing objectives, defending positions, or escorting valuable assets. The game’s various modes, including Push, Firefight, and Checkpoint, offer diverse challenges that test different aspects of tactical proficiency.Visually, Insurgency: Sandstorm may not boast the cutting-edge graphics of some AAA titles, but it compensates with meticulously designed maps that offer a variety of environments, from dense urban centers to sprawling rural landscapes. These maps are not only visually distinct but also intricately designed to support a wide range of tactical approaches.However, Insurgency: Sandstorm is not without its flaws. New players may find the steep learning curve daunting, as the game does little to hold your hand. The realism that hardcore fans love can be a barrier to entry for those accustomed to more forgiving shooters. Additionally, while the game has seen numerous updates and content additions, it still suffers from occasional bugs and performance issues that can detract from the overall experience.Despite these drawbacks, Insurgency: Sandstorm offers a refreshing alternative to more mainstream shooters. Its emphasis on realism and tactical gameplay creates a uniquely intense experience that stands out in the genre. For players who crave a challenging and authentic depiction of modern combat, Insurgency: Sandstorm is a compelling choice that rewards patience, precision, and teamwork.",8,True,"Jun 7, 2024"

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,ARSM,"The performance eventually became stable by 2022. Overall, they found a balance between hardcore simulators and arcade fun. All weapons are available from the first level, but it takes time to find your most suitable options and set of mods. The death is a matter of a couple of hits or one headshot, but it will not be easy to land those shots.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,Jumpup,"Not able to review this for PS4 so I will drag the PC score down until I can: this game has been out 3 years on PC, it’s become quite apparent that PC footage was used to sell the PS4 version as the PS4 Day one version in no way looks like or has the fidelity of the PC version. It’s a stuttering, Tearing un optimized mess on day one, a new developer I would give a by ball but this is a 3 year old game and it looks and runs like a PS2 game with the graphics of MGS 1. Lets run down the list of issues this scummy developer thought they would get away with: No Hit Detector, No Kill Detector, A weird marker for friendly’s that appears to the side of them and at some distance from them, a broken comms system where enemy conversations can be heard, screen tearing, lack of any anti-aliasing, Lack of HD graphics, this things running in standard def, lack of textures, broken load out system that fails to remember saved load outs, Lack of progress markers, lack of round information, lack of scoring system, an extremely low draw distance, a gutted game mode system, no vehicles, pop in everywhere, lack of 60fps (in an FPS of all things) a mess of a menu system, a diabolical weapon modification system that remembers nothing, a class system that’s all over the place with standard sniper, heavy, light and assault classes all behind paywalls. And the most important part the bullet physics, I understand the game is built around this but with the exceptionally low graphics there is simply no point to it, I cannot see the drop to correct the shot through the tearing and jaggy choppy gameplay. A f*cking disgrace of a day one release after 3 years to polish. Its no wonder medicritic has reviews switched off on the PS4 and Xbox versions. Well let’s hope users who can’t review it over there come here and drag the PC score down with this sinking ship cause these scum don’t deserve to get away with this at £59.99… (DO NOT BUY ON CONSOLE!

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,Locusthorde300,"Looks great, adds new gameplay features, and generally improves the gameplay. But the balance and knowledge on weapons is completely out of whack. Some guns are just objectively better than others with no regards to what their actual performance is. Case and point is the AS VAL. It somehow does less damage than 9x19mm, despite shooting 9x39mm.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,facknrite,"Sooooooooooo after waiting 6 months waiting for an update and optimization for the game, DEV's launched 1.6 test version which includes 1 mediocre map and 2 new guns that have an excesive stupid recoil and added it to the advisor class removing the SVD and EBR MK14 that were the most used guns by players on that class.

They also added the most stupid feature called DEATHCAM which is total trash because now you can see from where you got shot from and all the enemies on that area, meaning that the tactical part of the game is lost.

Once again after hundreds of complaints about that stupid feature they are still going to implement it on the stable version which demonstrate that they don't give a **** about their community feedback and they will still do whatever they want.

So my question is...what is the point of asking feedback when DEV's really don't care about your opinion unless you kiss their a$$es with every stupid decision they make.

Just to make a quick summary of what you will be getting by buying this game is:

- 0 optimization (optimization for this DEV's means, removing stuff from the maps)
- Updates every 6 months which are just gonna be trash.
- Hit Reg issues
- Abandoned Server Owners (Meaning no new cvars, no server side optimization)
- Terrible Hit Reg
- Unknown Performance(The game can run amazingly well on a top tier PC ro it can run like trash on the same PC)
- Fed Up Community (Tired of all the **** of the game and DEV's that got stucked with a facked up game without the option to refund it)

So if you are willing to go through all of that then buy it, if not then save your money and wait for some amazing titles being launched this year.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,Nstarnoe,"I was really looking forward to playing this game and it seem like a fun game when I tried it. But the performance is the worst I have ever experienced in any game.

Despite barley using a third of my cpu and GPU processing power the game runs a a very unstable 70 FPS on the lowest possible settings (I easily get 160 FPS on high setting in much more demanding games) on top that there is constant lag.

This game has very friendly and funny **** only flaw might be getting new guns, getting some standard pieces is not a problem, but for other bundles with skins, emotes, guns etc., you need to either buy game credit or spend some time in the game in order to find these credits.

Risk of Rain 2,632360,Nazrielau05,"I blew 10 hours into Risk of Rain 2. I couldn't get past through Mithrix **** this playthrough made me appreciate this game a whole lot more.

I was never too impressed with the game's presentation. I think i just needed more time to get comfortable with the game's general direction. It's not the most visually interesting game I've played, but at least the character design, enemy designs, level design, and colour grading all comes together to deliver a solid package of a visual style. I want to emphasis on the enemy designs here. Their designs are what sold me to the game's visual direction. The larger creatures has a certain aesthetic to them that compliments the background setting a lot.

I was also mixed on the music for a good while. I don't dislike them or anything, but i think i got very overwhelmed by the game's stimuli. The default settings for this game's audio was really loud and it made me uncomfortable. It's not until i turned down the volume until i could appreciate the game's audio design. The soundtrack elevates the hectic and chaotic battle sequences at least 10 times. Of course, this is only possible if the sound effects were good in the first place, and they are! the sound designs has so much weight to it. It really sells you the scale of the larger enemies in the game. Sound clues are also very effective here. A lot of sounds are exclusive to a certain type of threat. So a headphone/earphone is recommended to get the full experience.

This game's mechanics is the spotlight here. Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D Third person shooter game, and it uses that concept until the point of exhaustion. It's a philosophy that's very integral for any type of Art. You thought of a concept? use it over and over again until you couldn't think of anything more. Some of the most memorable enemies for me are the airborn ones! That's a serious feat in my opinion. And some of the on-ground enemies could jump/float! just to mess with your sense of vision. This game's battle sequences are extremely hectic and chaotic. This experience is probably what made me uncomfortable about the game for a good while. So many things could happen in a blink of an eye! the stimuli is insane.

Another thing about RoR 2's mechanics I've seen being brought up by the community is the Rogue-like implementation. Other Rogue-like video games won't allow you to have too many abilities in a single run, just because they don't want you to be too powerful. Like Hades, Inscryption, and Buckshot Roulette, just to name a few. Risk of Rain 2 is perfectly fine with you stacking up so many insane power ups on top of the external helps (Drones, Turrets, Guardians etc.). RoR 2 allows the player to feel like an absolute monster. How did the game balance this mechanic? The final boss could steal your items and abilities. You get them back by dealing damage at the bastard. Insane video game. The game's battle system oozes so much polish and care behind it. I couldn't help but feel inclined to boot up RoR 2 day after day just to experience it again. Risk of Rain 2 is a very fresh experience in the Rogue-like space. Not necessarily the absolute king of the genre, but a unique exprience nonetheless.

Risk of Rain 2,632360,Sepherim,"Inicialmente, Risk of Rain 2 me gustó mucho, pero a medida que fueron pasando las horas rápidamente se fue transformando cada vez más en aburrimiento. Las razones hablaré de ellas ahora, pero quiero que quede claro que lo jugué en solitario, con lo que probablemente las sensaciones y eso para quienes lo jueguen en multiplayer con amigos (como está diseñado) sean mejores. Si resumimos mucho, el juego es un shooter rogue-like, con mogollón de enemigos, cada vez más y más duros, en lo que explorar zonas para conseguir mejoras aleatorias y desbloquear el teleportador previa batalla contra el boss. El problema es que se hace muy repetitivo porque le faltan cosas típicas de los roguelike. Una de esas cosas es que los mapas aquí son fijos (con variaciones menores como zonas pequeñas que pueden estar accesibles o no), con lo cual se acaba conociendo los mismos demasiado, si además tenemos en cuenta que los primeros los ves todo el rato, se acaba haciendo muy repetitivo. Luego le falta una historia así como un sistema de progresión de cualquier clase que otorgue objetivos o razones para jugar, pero en este caso cada intento es completamente independiente. El único cambio que queda de una partida a otra es lo que vas desbloqueando, que se hace en base a conseguir logros, algunos de los cuales ocurrirán simplemente por ir jugando, pero la mayoría acaban dependiendo del azar de que te caigan los bonos adecuados, de que una habilidad ocurra de cierto modo, etc. lo cual acaba siendo muy frustrante. Igual que lo es el hecho de que, llegado cierto punto y con una build decente, al final el juego se resume en ""te vas cargando todo sin que te hagan nada hasta que llegas al lugar equivocado y sin que puedas evitarlo, de una hostia te bajan entero"". Gráficamente el juego tiene una estética muy suya pero personalmente no me ha gustado nada,  y tiene además ciertos problemas de legibilidad en la distancia (como que los cadáveres de ciertos enemigos parecen cofres). La música ahí ya es cosa de gustos, para mi es demasiado electrónica noventera, que es un género que no me convence, pero ahí habrá a quien si le parezca perfecta y sin duda, no puedo decir que sea mala pese a que no encaje en mis gustos. No hay voces como tales, los efectos de sonido son muy básicos. Y el juego tiene ciertos bugs ocasionales como cosas que spawnean dentro de paredes, una baja IA de enemigos y aliados, **** todo ello, Risk of Rain no me parece un juego terrible, pero tampoco gran cosa.

Pros: Intense atmosphere - Realistic gunplay - Teamwork is crucialCons: Steep learning curve - Outdated visuals - Not newbie-friendly Rising Storm 2: Vietnam stands out among war games with its emphasis on realism and tactical depth. It’s not the most accessible title, but once mastered, it offers a deeply satisfying and immersive experience. The game captures the chaos of the Vietnam War with great authenticity—from the crack of gunfire to the intensity of large-scale firefights. Teamwork is absolutely crucial, as success depends more on coordination than individual skill. While its dated visuals and steep difficulty may deter newcomers, players who enjoy a strategic and

It's tough and will kick your ass, but it's such a blast to play. It's not perfect. The game never feels ""stable,"" and stuff like ping is constantly all over the place across the board. But it doesn't really detract from the experience too much.  It's really a good time.

There are some aspects that aren't ideal. The community is pretty toxic at times, but it's not something that plagues the entire player base. There are also a lot of classes where you will not be able to play 99% of the time. A lot of the classes can only have a certain amount of people select it at once, and it's based on a mostly first come, first serve basis around how quickly you load into the game.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,Cthulhu5000,"This review is based on experience playing RS2:V after EGA giveaway. If you grab game for free this might help you decide is it worth actually downloading.

It's my first realistic MMOFPS, I enjoyed it so much at first, I'd made a little research through guides and game history, and now ready to present my opinion.

IF IT WAS 2017, I'D RATE GAME 8 OR 9 OUT OF 10. BUT THERE ARE TO MANY ""BUTS"" NOW. As you could've guessed, FOR SHORT VERSION READ ONLY CAPS from now on.

GAME IS BASICALLY ABANDONED BY DEVELOPERS. That's it. It was free giveaway because company no longer interested in the game. Original developer team is long gone and had to be recontacted to do EGS-transfer and troubleshooting.
There is stuff just cut out from the game. It's three maps and M16A2. Game realistically doesn't have over 9000 guns, so it's really important. There are some balancing issues never to be resolved (Long Tan map for example). No event support at all (like Halloween). Graphics are just bad. No bulletholes on surfaces, you can't zero your gun properly while training. No internal guides, just two training areas, one of which being actual map, no ability to train with bots there. There are nasty bugs, I'd seen on 2017 videos and even 2015 CBT footages. Going prone and standing up can result in your legs being under the ground and you will limp excessively. In this condition, moving prone is the fastest way. If your helicopter crashed, you survived and some ally is near by, it mostly results in autokick from server for excessive team damage. There are of course some smaller bugs, but these two are the biggest pain.

CONTENT CREATORS ARE GONE. Basically no channels. Old guides with obsolete information. Placeholders, work-in-proogress, no longer supported everywhere.

PING IS HELL. Don't believe ping value of server in search. Multiply by at least 3, be ready for x4, expect x5. And magically 20 ping becomes 100. Sometimes, when we're losing, I check ping values of players. Losing team has higher values.

TO GET FULL GAME PAY EXTRA ~50$ MONTHLY. There are 2 types of servers. Official and private. Private costs money. You can't just create a room with setting, no-no, pay to third party. Official servers have some of only two game modes: Territory (capture the objective) and Supremacy (capture and hold for points). If you want to play Skirmish (team deathmatch), Campaign (consequent battles with its own rules) or Green Army Man DLC as Free Grunt (Territory and Supremacy) you have two options: go for someone's server hope for the best (ping, rules, community, quantity of players) or buy one for yourself and hope for the same best. Same applies for different settings (called mutators), like visibility of allied troops marks, making game more realistic.

GAMING COMMUNITY ****.
You get new players, that don't want to learn, grab most important classes, and try to play RS2V as generic MMOFPS, aiming for good K/D ratio, that they will never get, and not playing the objective.
On the other hand you have salty people that send anyone to training areas to learn to fly, for example. Well, it's really easy with 0 ms ping and when no one is firing at you.
Again, on some other hand you have kickers. They want your class just because. Or don't like you. Most notorious one changed team and kicked me. Why others agreed? I suppose, they thought ""if votekick is going, it's definitely for a reason"". So, I ask you, if you'll play, never votekick if you don't know the crime.
Just bad commanders.

Combat, gameplay, pace, maps, guns, sound, and Community are awsome.

Servers, Graphics, and animation ****!

Gameplay-
Its just divine, you feel like you are really in the war, and you can't just run for the objective, you need to be careful, cooperate with your teammates.
The shots feel real, and every decision you make will have an impact (good or bad).
The community always tries to help and is respectful.

Now the bad points:

Graphics and animations-
They look kinda bad and outdated, even for a 2017 game, I mean, its unreal engine 3 and there are a lot of visual bugs.

Servers-
Now, this is THE big problem:
The worst servers I've seen in my entire life (including MW)... The game is free right now, and 20k people are playing the game, but it cant handle such amount of people! my question is: if they cant handle 20k players, why is it free?

Although it is a banal shooting range for speed,
But, the music makes this experience unforgettable and infinitely replayable, I respect the composer, this ""inducing"" motive, which, after passing the middle of the game, becomes generally mad - it's incredible.
The plot here, most likely, is about a drug addict who is trying not to die and get out of the ""binge"", and, of course, there is not enough full-fledged story up to 10/10, but you can imagine any story convenient for you in your head, where the main character needs to run until the end and not die. Another flaw of the game for me is not very well-developed shooting, I completed game with a shotgun, it's much easier, but the ""aim-challenge"" is losted.
Well, I can also say that sometimes quite beautiful locations are generated, all the sounds are of high quality.
And yet, the game is quite easy, in fact, it takes 4-7 hours to complete, even if you don’t know how to shoot (again, shotgun helps you), lacks some kind of hardcore mode, but it would be even better to get the second part)

Это игра - настоящее произведение искусства!
Хоть и представляет из себя банальный тир на скорость,
Но, музыка делает этот экспериенс незабываемым и бесконечно реиграбельным, композитору моё почтение, вот этот ""нагнетающий"" мотив, который после прохождения середины игры становится вообще бешенным - это невероятно.
Сюжет тут, скорее всего, про наркомана, который пытается не умереть и выбраться из ""запоя"", и, полноценной истории до 10/10, конечно, не хватает, но вы можете представлять в голове любую удобную вам историю, где главному герою надо добежать до конца и не умереть. Ещё один недостаток игры для меня в не очень проработанной стрельбе, я проходил только с дробашом, так гораздо легче, но ""аим-челлендж"" теряется.
Ну а так, ещё могу сказать, что иногда генерируются довольно красивые локации, все звуки качественные.
И ещё, игра достаточно лёгкая, на самом деле, проходится за 4-7 часов, даже если вы не умеете стрелять (опять же, шотган в помощь), не хватает какого-то хардкор режима, а лучше было бы вообще получить вторую часть)",8,True,"Jun 3, 2022"

Pros.:
- Old-school vibe and aesthetics.

If you feel like you might like it from the trailer you will most definitely love it, it's pretty straight forward. 

I had to cut one point because there are parts of the game that didn't click for me. Sometimes I got lost in the level and wasn't sure how to progress, but not for long fortunately. The flipping mechanic is very confusing with the perspective change on the camera. There were also certain spots where the enemies would get stuck, but not too many. 

These are all just nitpicks. This game is absolutely gorgeous.",9,True,"Oct 4, 2023"
Dusk,1100600,Zski,"This is a game that has to be played to understand why the reviews are so high. I watched videos and thought it looked neat, but it wasn’t really pulling me in. It sat in my library for over a year, and within 5 minutes of experiencing it, I understood. A couple days later, I finished the game, and what a wonderful treat for people who grew up with the original Quake. This game seriously captures the same energy of Quake without making the formula feel in any way dated. The gameplay is very simple, but it’s a nice refreshing throwback to when games required the fast paced run and gun movement rather than relying on cover. Where I think the game really shines is the atmosphere - who would have ever thought that this game with its intentionally retro graphics and play style would have a creepier atmosphere than many modern horror games. The initial part of the game gave me the atmospheric feeling of Resident Evil 4, except better. Some of the later sections of the game are truly unsettling. Between the beautiful yet extremely simple graphics and the phenomenal sound design, it helps tell the story of the game without the game actually having much of an overt story at all. Everything is told through the atmosphere and level design. It was actually pretty fun guessing what was going on and trying to create a story for yourself, since there is hardly any written or spoken dialogue. The sound design in this game is fantastic, a master in its class and it outsides most major modern horror games - especially some of the settings in the later portions of the game. It’s a pretty challenging game, but its highly rewarding. While it got frustrating at times, the satisfaction of pushing through a level and completing it after multiple tries was something I rarely experience in games anymore. The only flaw I would say is regarding some of the level design, which is true to the classic genre, but it didn’t age the best. I found myself lost pretty regularly because a lot of the textures and buildings look the same. Sometimes it allowed for some fun exploration, other times I was just running around for several minutes unable to figure out where I last saw something. There are a few really dark levels that were particularly irritating because of how difficult it was to find your way around. Overall, this is an excellent game that I think fans of the classics and modern shooter fans can both enjoy all the same. Everything this game sets out to do it excels at.",9,True,"Aug 17, 2023"

Anger Foot,2198510,CrackDiet,"Overall a very fun, unique and interesting experience. The world of S#*t city is pungent, and fits exceptionally well with its art style (both in game and within the intro cutscene and accompanying art), atmosphere, tone and, best of all, the soundtrack. 
Gameplay is engaging. As you progress and complete challenges within missions, you acquire a new pair of trainers which give you modifiers which range from a second life, explosions when you kick doors, giving enemies big heads, etc. It bodes well for replayability. The game at its core isn’t so challenging, but when going for the challenge stars, it makes the game a lot more difficult. 

The thing I like the most about this game is the artstyle, music, atmosphere and setting, I think it all fits together exceptionally well, and gives a breath of fresh air to the genre. A unique experience, and something that will stay in my mind for a while. Highly recommend if you enjoy underground counterculture, pungent violence, somewhat challenging gameplay, and rave music",9,True,"Oct 11, 2025"

Anger Foot,2198510,CthlhuCory,This game reminds me a lot of the Ghostrunner series where it's definitely a first person shooter/melee game but it's less about just shooting your way through levels and more about being precise. Feels more like a puzzle game to an extent than just a straightforward shooter. Definitely a game where it's all about trial and error and you will absolutely have to play a level multiple times to get your run down perfect. A little frustrating because of this and because it feels like a grind and I constantly feel like even if I am doing well I could get killed going through a new doorway and have to restart the whole level all over again. The music is great and it is kind of a ridiculous concept of the world run by gangs and you being the one guy who's not in a gang. Gameplay is super solid though which is bringing me back into it for sure. The random driving mechanics they threw in to the last two levels of the game totally threw me off and they were not intuitively controlled at all and that dropped the score for me because a solid shooter became a janky Drive Fest in the very last stretch of the game.,7,True,"Feb 5, 2025"

Better movement, gameplay and control that most of the Doom/Quake-like out there. 
The music its great, like in Hotline, without the music this game wouldn`t be half of what it is.
Good art style, coherent with its setting and story. 
Can replay the levels multiples times to get all stars and not feel discouraged in failure. However, once completed in full, there`s nothing that makes you try again. What`s the problem about this? The game is short already, and the full levels don`t add much time of play to the pool.

Идея того, что время движется только тогда, когда двигаешься ты, заставляет продумывать каждый шаг и делает игру похожей на своеобразную стратегию в реальном времени. Атмосфера минимализма и яркий визуальный стиль тоже играют свою роль: красные враги на фоне белого окружения смотрятся стильно и придают всему происходящему особый шарм.Но, несмотря на оригинальность, есть моменты, которые могут надоесть. Кампания довольно короткая, а после прохождения основного сюжета остается не так много причин возвращаться. Кроме того, сама концепция замедления времени интересна, но в какой-то момент она перестает быть чем-то необычным и превращается в рутину.В итоге Superhot — это отличная игра для пары вечеров, но ее идеи не раскрываются в полной мере.

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,Highwayy,"Legends of Runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. Most importantly, LoR innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like Hearthstone). With most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. The artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like League of Legends and Arcane. The game offers an incredible and near-endless PvE experience in addition to PvP: in fact, PvP has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. The future is difficult to predict and I hope that PvP will grow more as my heart will always be in PvP gameplay. Perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for PvP.

I felt this isn't an ACTUAL card game because you don't get your cards by chance, but the cards you pick up are heavily influenced by the (winning/losing) stance you are in (Losing = **** cards each round, winning = Stronger cards each round), The probability of getting certain cards is sealed depending on whether you are winning or losing, unlike REAL card games, the chance of getting any card is always 1 / Total number of cards.",7,True,"Mar 22, 2025"

Today I played lor, I played LAB mode. A mode that fights with Ai with characters like Yasuo Jinx Jayce to choose from. I have played Yasuo until Victor. Before reaching the Viktor stage, I had to pass a level where it was random, every turret Round start.
I'm going to tell you that **** is so unbalanced I'm stuck at level 3 4 times and still haven't passed.
I think what
1. Unbalanced is a card that Ai randomly gets and still gets a Key word. Key word is this. It pisses me off a lot. I randomly hit through and the one that hit through is a T-Rex 8/8.
2. The card I have The gad I randomly picked up some important characters.
2.1 Cleared the whole board (this one I'm okay with) but what's not okay is when the main character is dead What character? to defeat the T-rex 8/8 Overwhelm.

2.2 Random Gards Gards that can make me play easier won't say. For example, if I do a Yasuo + Yone combo, these gards won't come out.

End. I'm dizzy. I'm totally out of mood playing this LAB. I wasted 1 to 2 hours.

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,Noiza,"The game is something between Meh and OK.
F2P friendly, nice Graphics/Artwork and regual new content makes it fun for a game now and then.

The biggest let down for me are Bugs, Metaplay and communication.
Bugs appear on a dayli base and range from grafics glitches into others to cards wont work or you cant place them (even though i encountered gamebreaking bugs very rarely).
Bugs stay in the game for very long until they get fixed e.g. Shurima came out 8 Months ago and Azirs voice lane is still cut during the lvl up animation.

Communication means, i have the feeling they only hear positiv feedback and ignore negativ feedback/player suggestions, one reason i post my critic here.
Imo the Report Side is not comfortable (i was not able to use it for a long time) and i dont like the big chatroom on discord, i feel ignored.

There are a lot builds you can play but only for the Memes, not for winning. In ranked, you can see only flavor of the month, the Metagame is very strong in this one.
Off-Meta builds are really not fun to play and the few Meta Builds change on every patch.
Power Creep is a huge problem in LoR, every patch, the new Cards are way more powerfull then the ""older ones"", either by having way better Stats/cost ratio or have the same stats but really good keywords.
The game makes no secret that it has its focus on fast games, thats why rush decks are Meta and lategame or control decks feel useless. E.g. Seamonsters needs you to throw 25 of your 40 cards away ,literally(!), to have theyr keyword work.
The only reason i do sometimes recommend it to some die hard League fans is its because its F2P.

Clair Obscur Expedition 33,1903340,YusufBolluk,"Hikayesiyle, oynanışıyla, sanat tasarımıyla, şarkılarıyla, ses tasarımıyla çok güzel tam paket bir oyun. Oynanış JRPG tarzına parry ekleyerek çok güzel bir tat katıyor. JRPG kısmının derinliği aşırı değil ama gayet yeterli ve oyun boyunca sizi tutabiliyor. Parry sistemi de JRPG'lerin kaçınılmaz olarak düştüğü tekrardan kurtarıyor. Normalde JRPG'lerde bir yerden sonra ekrana bile bakmadan oynarsınız. İsterse Persona olsun ister Sea of Stars olsun, en iyisi bile bir yerden sonra eksik kalır. Ancak bu oyun o sınıra çarpsa da parry sistemi sürekli odaklı kalmanızı sağlıyor. Oynanış kısmında tek sıkıntı diyebileceğim kısım level scaling olmaması. Yan görevlere falan giderseniz çok güçleniyorsunuz ve ana hikayede her şeye tek atar hale geliyorsunuz. Yan içeriklerde gücünüze uygun düşmanlar var ancak ana hikaye seviyenizin çok gerisinde kalıyor. Oynayacaksanız önce ana hikayeyi bitirip sonra yan görevlere gitmeyi düşünebilirsiniz.

Clair Obscur Expedition 33,1903340,Tarquin,"Bought this game with the expectations of getting the masterpiece, the best game ever made, the true ultimate legend ****. Instead I got huuuge disappointment and wasted dozens of euros. I got a game with falsely described genre, a game with shallow characters, a game which is now a new king of running simulators, as there is literally nothing else to do, you just run, and then you fight, and then run again, and fight, and run, and fight, .... I was told it was great turn-based game with real-time mechanics, instead I got QTE game, but with control over up to 3 characters (so I did QTE in turns for them). Combat is also extremely unbalanced, as literally just parrying can win every single fight in this game, while missing a dodge or parry in later stages of the game means instant fail, team death and reset from last save. This is tied to abilities and perk-buy management. There are multiple distinct abilities (at least the text is different), however because of the lack of game balance I mentioned previously, it actually does not matter what abilities does player pick, as dodging or parrying perfectly is the only singular requirement to win every single fight in the entire game without any exceptions. Adding to that, this results in excesive repetitivness of gameplay. Next up, I was expecting bit of a roleplaying (that is this ""RP"" in RPG), but I got no dialogues at all while playing the game (except for the camp, there I was able to read few lines of dialogues, and except for cutscenes, obviously). Many praised this game for story, but somehow I got another cheap premise with rushed second half of the story. The idea was good though, just the execution was simply bad. Nonchalant ""cute"" cutscenes did not fit the narrative and were breaking the ""immersion"" for me, although immersion is veeeery strong word to use here, as this game does not deliver immersion of any kind. The same goes for OST, which was quite good, however some anime-like combat bangers absolutely did not fit the atmosphere at all. Last but not least I will mention the visuals, which are as good as in any UE5 game, so nothing special there, but nothing to complain about either, except for two things - 1) developers tried to make every environment special, unique and distinct, but the result is quite the opposite as all the locations feel simmilar in every way except for colours used in them; and 2) glitches were EVERYWHERE.

In conclusion, the hype around this game is as artificial as it gets, driven by ""30 devs"" story, which is also not true. This game has nothing much to offer for people with some standards. If you like empty corridors, endless running and QTE, this is a game for you. Objectively, if this was not advertised as ""game of the generation"" I would give this game like 4/10, however, I expected 100x more from advertised ""masterpiece"" and ended up deeply disappinted, like I probably never was before.",1,False,"Nov 10, 2025"

Additionally, the zombies exhibit an uncanny ability to detect the player from great distances, which can become exceedingly bothersome.

Disco Elysium,632470,razzzor,"Are all the critics on a rush of putting anything intellectual and different as game of the year? I just got done playing Journey (late on the PC) and was just as puzzled as to how that was game of the year.This is standard point-and-click adventure gaming, absolutely nothing ground-breaking apart from just good writing. If you like that sort of thing and love reading books of that style, you'll enjoy it I suppose.

The only difference is it's much longer than your standard adventure game, more depth in the skills and the dialogue just goes on and on. Half a million lines they say? Do I really want to read all that? Much of it is just pointless dribble. You have all these inside voices that speak, but it's not really that interesting. The most interesting dialogue in the whole game was the humour from the two kids near the start and the ringing the police station.

The art/design is all beautiful. But it's still stuck in an overhead isometric camera view. For sure if they had a AAA budget they would do a third-person mouse look, that's far more immersive. Can you imagine watching a movie, or even a 20 hour TV series, where its just this one view above their heads? It would be laughed at. But somehow, 40 years since the start of the isometric point and click, we're still stuck on this low budget camera angle. You never see the characters faces. Even in the small picture frame you get of the characters, which often barely resemble the model on-screen, it's just a static picture. The main character never even has a voice, and your sidekick is deadpan in everything he says. This is lacking in any expression or emotion. When you only have the budget to do a single isometic angle, this simply can't be a 9+/10. You'll also have to fight through sluggish movement, constantly bumping into invisible walls absolutely everywhere trying to work out the small path to walk. I even had a few game ending bugs that I had to reload from.

The overall gameplay revolves around slowly walking back and forth for hours clicking things until something happens in the game, because it's often unclear what you're supposed to do so you just have to click everything, exhaust every dialogue tree, until one of the many missions you have resolves something so you can continue. You'll get a dialogue dead-end where you don't have the skills or research necessary to continue, so you do random tasks to unlock it, or reload the game over and over until you pass the check my chance. I also didn't load a lot into the skills because it's so unclear what's really going to help, as well as how many skill points you have. So I just left it until the end game to when I thought I would need them, but I still didn't. I'd probably only used 5 skills points throughout the game.

The skill sets and requiring certain skills, items and tasks to be completed to unlock dialogue is still a nice idea overall and I'm not sure how you could tweak it to make it better. But a 9/10, nope.

What was good about most of the game was the story, which had me continuing to play it to see how in unravelled. But in the end, without spoilers, the conclusion really had absolutely nothing to do with anything up till that point and just felt like the writer didn't have any idea how to finish it so just threw something in there to wrap things up. A major disappointment.

This is a nice simple point and click adventure, but it goes on for far too long. Over 20 hours I spent on it and was ready for it to be over before then. The highlights for me are just seeing a nice new area of the map. It's not the mountains of dialogue, the story that was never properly concluded, or the very basic puzzle solving. But I can see much better looking design in a full 3D game and countless adventure games already look this beautiful.

I'd give it a 7/10. I think the critics have just forgotten what normal adventure games are like and got all hung  up on intellectual dialogue and skill trees.",7,True,"May 1, 2025"

Disco Elysium,632470,PenetratorGod,"I played the game and it was definitely one of the worst and boring games I've ever seen and I deleted it. It's not a game, it's more like an e-book.

First of all, this is not an open world game. I have no idea how it can be marketed like this, have the makers ever seen an open world game? The NPCs do nothing but sleep at night and the world is a small and frankly empty map. It's static and dead and never changes. It's not even a world, let alone an open world.

It's not a real RPG either. Yes, you have stats and inventory and dice rolls, but that's it. Also, these are just game mechanics, there's a skill tree and inventory like in a lot of games, but they don't make a game an RPG game, and there's no real choice, because the whole difference is tied to dialog options, which you'll click on anyway, further destroying the role-playing part, and for a lot of things, choosing to do something will actually be a dice roll, and the mechanics of retrying the roll are overly complicated and too overwhelming to take the time.

No matter what you do, you'll be dragged towards a single ending, which makes sense since it's a murder mystery, but as a player you have no choice, the only real choice is at the character creation screen, and from that point on it's pretty much set how you're going to play the next 30-40 hours of the game, which is filled with dialog just to drag it out.

Yes, you can click on options in dialog windows, but the game will decide for you whether that happens or not, and it will mostly depend on your character's stats and some modifiers. Yes, again, it's an RPG mechanic, but as a player, you don't really get to choose anything or do anything.

An example **** where your choices really matter would be Detroit Become Human. Or even Witcher 3. Disco Elysium is nowhere near that level, Detroit is already not an RPG game, Witcher 3 is not a pure RPG, but supposedly Disco Elysium was marketed as open world and a pure RPG, but it's not even half as successful as those games.

In short, Disco Elysium is not a game to be played even if it's free. I never understood what they liked about this game. It is one of the most overrated games of recent years.",4,False,"Sep 1, 2023"

Sea of Stars,1449850,Kai82,One on hand an incredibly good old school turn based RPG and on the other they use a lot of design choices I dislike. It is inspired by old RPGs like Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross. You can play as Valere or Zale who are Solstice Warriors. If you are born on summer or winter solstice you are special and can unlock sun or moon magic. Back in the past an evil alchemist named the Fleshmancer developed near godlike powers and nearly destroyed the world. His creations the Dwellers still exist and are only vulnerable on Eclipses to sun and moon magic. The story starts with Zale and Valeres training to become Solstice warriors and evolves to a fight to the fate of the world. The story and characters are superb. I felt the emotions and impacts the character face. I struggled with them and it was an intense feeling. The story evolves and has many surprises and turns. I think it is some of the best stuff in years. The gameplay is a bit mixed. I feel bad for mentioning it as it could just be not my taste. The turn base battles have a gimmick. Special attacks by the enemies can be nullified. Locks are displayed when an enemy cast a special attack. For example a moon and sword symbol. If you attack with a moon and sword attack (or both) before the counter reaches zero the attack is nullified. Normal attacks create mana orbs which can be used to power up your actions. Each character has his/her unique elements and used mana orbs are converted to their mana types.  Now to the choices I dislike. Your level ups are rare and give not much stat wise. You are give a choice to boost some stats on each level up but that makes not much difference. At the time I was in the final dungeon I was just on level 23 with a lot of grinding. They also don't want you to power level. The experience points from battle decrease on each level up. Also the true ending requires a lot of effort that feels like a chore. Here I had a bug that prevents me from getting it. Luckily there is YouTube. Finally the resource management is a bit of a chore too. You can switch to auto heal after each battle which gives a total different gaming experience. If not you have a boring cycle of collecting food and cooking to replenish health. Sadly you have a very limited storage for cooked items. The Wheels mini game is really nice and I enjoyed it. The presentation is superb. The graphics look really great and the soundtrack is memorable. Overall I ended up enjoying the game even with its flaws.

Crusader Kings III,1158310,nbdiden,"Crusader Kings III remains the crown jewel of character-driven grand strategy: a sprawling medieval soap opera where secrets, stress, hooks, and schemes make people—not provinces—the real battlefield. Five years on, a steady cadence of expansions and free patches has turned a strong launch into a remarkably rich sandbox. Royal Court introduced artifacts, court grandeur, and a deep culture rework with traditions and hybridization. Tours & Tournaments overhauled activities and travel so your ruler actually roams the map to host tournaments, weddings, and realm tours that blend story and statecraft. Legends of the Dead added prestige-building legends and frightening, map-wide epidemics that finally put mid-to-late-game comfort at risk. Roads to Power revitalized the Byzantine experience, layered in administrative government and family estates, and even let you play as a landless adventurer. 2025’s Khans of the Steppe brought a sharper nomadic identity and seasonal pressures to the steppes, while the small Coronations pack turns being crowned into a dramatic, choice-filled ceremony. With All Under Heaven on the horizon expanding the map into East Asia, CK3 continues to widen its **** result is a game that excels as a story engine first and a map painter second. Cultures feel alive rather than static tech trees, court identity gives you long-term goals, and activities pull you out of menus and into your realm’s politics. New playstyles—from imperial intrigue to nomadic ambition—keep campaigns fresh, and the mod scene supercharges longevity with total conversions and quality-of-life tools. That said, warfare and economy remain intentionally broad-brush, which may disappoint players chasing crunchy tactical depth or intricate economic loops. Very large realms can still snowball into stability unless you lean on game rules or self-imposed challenges, and each big chapter tends to arrive with balance bumps that need hotfixes. The DLC web is real, too: while major patches are generous, the “full modern CK3” experience is spread across multiple add-ons. On platforms, PC is definitive thanks to mods, but the PS5 and Xbox versions have matured into genuinely comfortable ways to play, even without mod support.Verdict: Crusader Kings III is still the most entertaining medieval drama generator you can buy. With its expanding cast of systems and consistently surprising emergent narratives, it turns dynastic pettiness into grand history better than anything else out there. Expect occasional rough edges and a growing DLC bill, but the core magic remains unmatched. Score: 9/10.",9,True,"Sep 4, 2025"

Crusader Kings III,1158310,S1mon3,"Crusader Kings III is a deep and engaging grand strategy title that can keep you hooked for hours, thanks to its rich dynastic, political, and narrative mechanics. Managing your house, navigating tricky diplomatic decisions, and reacting to emergent story events make for an extremely immersive medieval experience for fans of the genre.However, a significant drawback is the absence of an official Italian localization. The volume of text is huge—beyond menus and mechanical descriptions, there are intrigues, legends, dynastic stories, and historical details that deserve to be read calmly and thoroughly. For many non-English speakers, this represents a real barrier that can discourage newcomers or prevent them from catching every narrative and gameplay **** Italian community has stepped in with fan-made translation mods on Steam Workshop or Paradox Mods—often updated with care and covering a very high percentage of strings. These “do-it-yourself” solutions greatly improve accessibility but have two main limits: they require manual updates after each patch or DLC, and even when done well, occasional translation inconsistencies or unlocalized strings can slip through, disrupting the **** a text-heavy, narrative-rich game like this, an official translation would ensure consistency and completeness, avoiding the frustration of missing strings or mod incompatibilities. It would also signal that Paradox Interactive values the Italian market, helping grow the player base by making the game more approachable for those less comfortable in English or who simply prefer playing in their native language.Setting aside this issue, the gameplay itself remains outstanding: the interface is polished, the tutorial helps you start but mastering the complex mechanics still takes time, and multiplayer offers compelling challenges with friends. The historical depth and freedom to craft unique stories make Crusader Kings III one of the best titles in its genre, despite the steep learning **** summary, I give it 8/10 because at its core the game is excellent and deeply satisfying for grand strategy enthusiasts, but the lack of an official Italian localization significantly reduces accessibility for many players. Fan translations are a great resource, but they can’t replace a professional localization effort: if Paradox released official Italian support, I would raise this score.",8,True,"Jun 17, 2025"

* Too much focus on RPG part of the game (frequent random events that get repetitive/annoying very quickly) instead of the mechanics. Many parts of the game could use new/deeper mechanics (HRE, papacy, crusades, diplomacy, republics etc.). Unfortunately the DLC seems to focus on even more RPG events instead of core game mechanics.

* Game too easy overall. Limitless aggressive expansion is possible. Intrigue is too powerful.

* Bad UI, even by Paradox standards. The new map lacks many important viewmodes that were essential in CK2, and requires you to zoom in/out constantly to finally fade in the content you need (armies, counties etc. - but at the same time you get useless terrain features, snow effects etc.).

You have no plan where to go, what to do, or why to do anything.
The puzzles, which are logical and fun at the beginning, become too frequent and illogical over time, making them frustrating.

Система сохранений - сохраняет когда ей вздумается. Баланс классов просто отсутствует - вор и лучник бесполезны чуть больше чем полностью. Ахуеть, вместо того, что бы получать радость от игры у меня постоянно было чувство страдания. Походу целью разработчиков была проверка игроков на прочность. Система таргетинга откровенно хуевая - время от времени то и дело, что получаются миссклики. Вместо того что бы ударить - персонаж начинает пиздовать кудато, что невыносимо выводит из себя.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,TemplarGR,"Terribly overrated game. Let me tell you something kids, as a hardcore RPG veteran with decades of experience: Just because you are starved for a new RPG, doesn't mean that every piece of garbage that arrives at the stores and has character stats is worth it. Back in the day, we experienced a similar RPG drought, which ended with Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, and Final Fantasy VII. See? We celebrated with real classics, not this overrated garbage.

This game is huge, but only because it is tedius. You will go pixel hunting like a mad man for no reason. It is filled with containers that have nothing inside. It has plenty of mechanics and stats to master but once you finally understand the system it lacks serious depth. The turn based combat is slow, boring, and has no reason to be turn based. The story is meh. The dialogs are cringe-worthy. Decent graphics and voice acting, and after patches is at a very good shape, but this is not enough.

It will demand a lot of time and patience from you, but it won't satisfy you. It doesn't really deliver as an RPG. Those who compare this to the classics like Baldur's gate, are out of their minds and i am fairly certain they have never played it.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,Voyou,"Looking for a real RPG (as opposed to a Hack n' Slash or a platformer with skills tree), I start DOS, and immediately notice I'm in amateur territory: barely readable fonts, and no way to increase them. If you asked me 30 years ago, I would have guessed that the bigger our monitors would become, the better we could read. How it came to the exact opposite is obviously due to a conspiracy of ophthalmologists bribing game developers. Anyway, barely, but still readable, so I keep going. Instead of resting my eyes 15 minutes per hour, I'll just have to swap and actually play 15 minutes per hour.

Character creation time. A very exciting step in an RPG for sure, and usually a long one. Here, we start with a surprising surprise: we create 2 characters. Hmm... I'm a bit confused. I like talking at the singular 1st person about myself, and my avatar. That's what happens when a player feels invested in a game, and that's a plus for said game. So, will I have to use the plural, like the famous British tapeworm, Queen Victoria ? We want to be amused, and we are all for experiments, even doomed ones, so we keep going.

Characters creation was actually very quick, and very underwhelming. A few skills, some of them opening a talent pseudo-menu (pseudo because it offers actually no choices,) and we are done. Also, there are only 2 races: male and female. Err... I meant... only 2 species: bodybuilder and barbie doll. Anyway, you get our meaning. I mean, my meaning.

I both hop on a beach (confusing, isn't it ?) It's a pretty 3d world, not gorgeous like these 2d painted games, but it will do nicely. Someone is talking near the west edge, but stays invisible. These long range constant chatters will prove very annoying in the future, specially in town. They'll make you want to go away instead of doing what you plan on doing.

And then, the pixel hunting starts. Pixel hunting is the meat of this game. In the following hours, I will have hovered over, then opened, hundreds of crates and vases. Most of them empty, yet my dreadfully cumbersome inventory screen will look like a huge pile of junk. And that will be enough for me to quit and have no desire to come back. I feel like I've been playing a hack n' slash without the hack. And, mostly, pixel hunting. In 2015.

Sure, a few nice things happened in the mean time: playing mostly a thief, I discovered an amusing take on the sneaking trope, and a challenging and interesting pickpocket mechanism. I got involved in a couple of fights, and backstabbing proved satisfying at this early stage. Using magic scrolls also proved very helpful, unlike in any other game (I usually can't be bothered, but here it felt natural.) And that's about it.

It's an RPG, so there are dialogues and interactions and story lines and stuff, but one word is enough to summarise them: childish.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,asfbr,"So just finished this after 30 hours of gameplay or so.
I really liked Harry Potter as a kid, read the books since goblet of fire as they were launched, good times... 
That automatically makes us like the game, although I feel there were lots of missed opportunities here.

The main story and quest line is great. Kudos for that. The rest, however, leaves it to be an average game. 

Main issues, in my view: 
#1 Side quests, although are not repetitive per se, gave me no incentive to me for doing that (with some exceptions in the beginning for spells etc.). 
#2 That is also linked to a mediocre item mechanics. You get better items, you upgrade with same materials, breed pets, that's it. After some time it's all legendary items. Also always same price in shops. No sets, only traits for gameplay styles. Could be a lot better.
#3 Natty side quests seemed empty. Game would be better without it and I can see why people complain and even say this was a ESG filler. That does not bother me, but the character is annoying and quests are bad
#4 Alohomora mechanics is a pain in the... really whoever was the game designer responsible for this did a terrible job. Not only boring, but annoying. Also the demiguises statues. I just found myself at the end of the game with level 1 alohomora and need to spend now 1 hour I guess to get the statues to finish the rest that I was locked out. What a pain. This alone to me warrants one star less. No wonder one of the main mods is to remove this
#5 the ""mini bosses"" or ""infamous foes"" could be a lot lot better. No development around them, instant petrific totalus on them. 
== All in all, this is a great Harry Potter game. But that's it. Remove the Harry Potter world and this would be an average skippable 6 or 7 game. I had a good time playing this for the nostalgy (I guess first game since Philosopher's stone for GBA back in 2001), but I really hope devs make a better job in HL2.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,MorfenA,"Hogwarts Legacy is a dream come true for fans of the Wizarding World, offering an immersive journey into the halls of Hogwarts and beyond. The game beautifully captures the magic and wonder of the Harry Potter universe, with stunning visuals, an expansive open world, and gameplay that makes you feel like you're truly living in that world. From casting spells to exploring hidden secrets, every moment is filled with nostalgia and **** gameplay is a highlight, providing a mix of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving that keeps you engaged throughout your adventure. The world of Hogwarts Legacy is nothing short of amazing, with every corner of the castle and surrounding areas meticulously crafted to create an authentic experience.However, the game isn't without its flaws. One of the noticeable drawbacks is the boss battles. While the encounters are visually impressive, the bosses lack a certain aura of intimidation and challenge that you’d expect. They often feel underwhelming, which detracts from the overall excitement of these key moments.Additionally, while the game’s world is rich and detailed, the lore and story can feel a bit flat at times.

Story: 5/10
This game's story is average. I didn't play it for the story. Being a Harry Potter fan, I was able to endure the story.

Combat: 8/10
The combat is very good, but the difficulty in switching between spell sets and the limited number of spells are annoying.

Characters: 5/10
Almost all the characters in the game are very boring. Including our main character. The only character I really liked was Sebastian Sallow. The dialogue from all the characters is very boring.

Quests: 7/10
Except for some quests, the quests are poor and unimpressive, but they're still quite good. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you won't be bored.
Gameplay: 8/10
The gameplay is good. Simple. The switching between spell sets is annoying. Flying in the game is fine, but it would be nice if there were more things to do while flying.

Its been about 1-2 years since I last played, but this is my review from what main take aways I remember from playing during the first month after release. 
It had some features that were cool to have and others that just fell flat. I think the attention to detail with the world was really cool as it felt you were truly in the movies. I think the story was also really good and engaging. It also was a nice touch with how your decisions can change your ending. 
My biggest regret was buying the deluxe edition as I mainly bought it for the Thestral mount but by the time you finally unlock mounts you will already have your broomstick lvl 2 or 3 and it will be faster to use and easier to control. I also liked how we got our own customizable rooms to use but after unlocking it and customizing the room after the tutorial I never went back besides when new sections got added. The combat is ok as I like that it forces you to use a mixture of the spells but the switching between spells during combat was not the smoothest and required you to remember the layout of what you had to quickly/smoothly transition to them but is kind of hard as you are adding spells pretty regularly.",7,True,"Jul 4, 2025"

Recuerdo pocos juegos como este, es como hablar con un maniquí, muy bonito de fuera, bien vestido, pero no responde ni tiene vida. Los NPC de este juego están allí para rellenar un poco el mapa, no tienen líneas de diálogo ni hacen nada más que no sea andar de un lado para otro (me refiero a fuera de Hogwarts). Lo peor del juego, es que te lleva de la mano en todo momento, todo está ""cerca"" o hay un punto de viaje rápido a 4 pasos. Las misiones no tiene ningún sentido con la trama principal, ni hacen nada para que conectes con los personajes secundarios que te las mandan. Todas son cortadas con el mismo patrón, camina, mata, vuelve, repite. Los puzles son extremadamente básicos y las secuencias de vídeo soporíferas.

Amazing artstyle that pays homage to classic jrpgs

Good voice overs,  nice music

Cons

Inexcusably tedious combat
Boring
Lacking polish

Octopath Traveler would have been great on SNES or PS1 back in the late 90s but for this era it is very dated which is a shame because graphically, it has a lot of vintage charm with nice graphics and some interesting story telling that unfortunately is let down by obnoxiously slow paced combat that makes the game get exceptionally boring fast forcing the player to either not bother and move on to a faster paced game,   even by all classic snes jrpgs virtually none have the same tedious turn based combat style.

Square Enix, you know better!  Don't ever make a turn based JRPG that takes several minutes just to beat one basic monster this makes for a tedious eye rolling slog.  It doesn't matter how deep the combat system is if you have players bored in the first hour of playing.",4,False,"Mar 26, 2021"
Octopath Traveler,1057090,Bertucciop,"Octopath traveler, they haven't worked enough on it and ask for 60€ for it. Made on Unreal Engine for quick development I think for commercial reasons. Below I break down the different aspects of the game.

Fantastic music, sound track is the best of the game. Each character has his own music theme, maybe too melancholic but is a 10/10.

The plot is too simple and linear, cliche characters, there is no evolution in them over time. Too Manichean, evil and good well separated. A noble girl becomes a prostitute seeking for vengeance for no reason, instead of using her money and inheritance for it. Anyways narrative is ok, it is ok even if it is full of topics and empty of plot twists. It is a game for kids, not a book. Hire a Jewish screenwriter to review it before starting though, Square Enix 6/10.

Gameplay is horrible, it is a typical 90's RPG game, but dynamics are too slow.

They made a weakness point counter system which stuns and weakens enemies when they came to 0. But there are not any strategic but this in the game. In addition, they made an initiative point system, these points increase if you do not use them, and they boost your skills and attacks.

Both systems combined make combat so tedious as you have to wait turns taking enemies weaknesses points as you wait to your initiative points to increase for making massive damage.

Boss fights long the same as common fights. And skills are limited, attack, heal, low, and increase defense and attack. Enemies can blind, sleep, etc. you but it is very limited to you to do these things. You have very powerful ultimate skills at your disposal that end a combat after gaining some initiative points.

These long fights appears each two steps on map, so you can't walk at all, unless you have a mage on team who provides of an extension walking longitude before fighting. Game is hardly bearable even with this mage's skill, it is unplayable if u don't have this.

You do not need to properly manage your items, you are full of healing things and other things, you will never run out of them, even resurrection items.

There is not any puzzle on map, just walking, taking treasure chests (some are hidden by 2D vision perspective) and fighting.

The interaction of the NPCs is the 90's RPGs and they added that, depending of which character is in your team, you can steal or trade items with them, even fight a duel or investigate them, which improves skills or shows you the positions of hidden items, which is a great thing, but the plot is linear so when you get to a village you just examine, steal or trade with everyone to get new items and upgrade skills, you can also have an NPC character following you and help you in battles, you cannot control them .

You cannot make any decision, there are not dialogues which spread a list of answers, plot is linear.
3/10

Talking about graphics, all goods things and effects came from Unreal Engine basics, so they didn’t have to work so much on it, they made low quality sprites for characters, and cartoon textures for the 3D maps and a static camera angle imitating 90's RPG quality, Low-cost graphics which did not provide budget for extending other game features.2/10

Octopath Traveler,1057090,JanaWonderland,"This is among the most disappointing JRPGs I've ever played.

At first I was pulled in by its beautiful artstyle and more than beautiful soundtrack, but that is pretty much it. You could compare it to a disfigured and moldy pumpkin trying to hide its atrocities behind make up and plastic surgeries.

The writing is beyond horrible. Characters that almost constantly act out of character, don't make sense whatsoever and doing things that - sure keep the story going but - do not make sense whatsoever. And instead of anyone questioning their behaviour like a normal person would, everyone just takes it the way it is. Good writing shouldn't need these inconsistencies only to keep the story going, instead its characters should keep it going naturally. Other than that it was able to partake in the biggest sin of story-writing possible: Overexposition. Whatever you see on screen, the game will not hesitate to think you stupid enough not to have taken in what happened and explains it in great depths, over and over again. Then of course it also mostly deals with themes explored by many RPGs before it, making it feel even lazier and more uncreative.

If that was the only gripe I have with this game, at the very least it could be a fun little gameplay-heavy game, but the gameplay is subpar at best for that to happen. Enemies, no matter if random encounter or bosses, are the epitome of bulletsponges. Fights are far from hard, after hours of playing it not once did I die, but instead fights are stretched out like an old stepped upon bubblegum. They are merely there to artificially make the game longer. Enemies weaknesses do not make sense most of the time and unlike other, good, JRPGs are just a guessing game, which makes the fights even more atrocious. The animations, slowdowns and particle effects at least make the actual attacks feel satisfying, but if the main parts of the fighting system can't hold up, that doesn't save it either.

So the fighting system is frustratingly annoying and the story-writing is insultingly bad... What else makes a good RPG? Freedom and exploring! The game is rather free with you being able to choose from 8 different characters that have different stories from the start to fit your playstyle. However outside of battle - in which they all behave relatively same-y - they only get one ""skill"" for you to use. Things like being able to steal from people, charm them or provocate them for a fight should make the game more interesting, but they barely have any consequences outside of what items you got, how much experience you get or which places to go. Places are by the way scarce. The big ""open"" world is designed in such a linear fashion, that exploration mostly consists of going off the path for a few seconds to open randomly placed chests. Now linearity is not a bad thing per se, but in a game where there isn't much of anything else, it was the last hope to get some good out of it.

The controls weren't problematic, as I've played it with my gamepad instead of using my mouse and keyboard, as that is just my preferred way of playing JRPGs. So I can't say much about how it does control with mouse and keyboard.

My recommendation is to save your money for something better. The gameplay, the story and the exploration are beyond disappointing. Listen to the soundtrack on YouTube or buy it extra somewhere else and avoid this game as well as possible.",2,False,"Sep 17, 2019"

The level of difficulty become a real grind at level 18, and in that sens, there is a lot of grinding when you arrive at the chapter 2 of each character, and chapter 3 is even more higher in terms of level. I don't feel like there is a natural way of levelling except grind. Which I found dull to no measure. The sounds are pretty good. The graphics are also very nice for a semi 2d game. I give it 72%.

You know you're out of the real world and into a classic game world (but with better graphics).

There is not just one story, but eight individual stories plus the overall story.  The writing is good.  Each character is distinctive.  For example, one character is a dancer who wants to bring smiles to the world!  I've never seen anything like that before.  It's nice to see happy characters who want to bring joy to the world.  Yet, there's also a thief character, who says ""heh, heh"" as she steals from townspeople.  This is the first time I've experienced this combat based on a break the enemy system.  The game runs smoothly on my PC, never a game performance problem.  In sum, a top quality game by Square Enix's currently best (or one of the best) developers, Team Asano.

Gameplay-wise, many of these obstacles are very easy to deal with. However, metaphorically, whenever Gris overcomes these setbacks, she heals a tiny bit of her psyche. More and more life, colour, and joy is brought back into her world, which is beautifully realised with both the gorgeous art design and a sublime soundtrack composed by the band Berlinist.

Yakuza Like a Dragon,1121910,TheL0neW0If,"I do not like the fact that I had to give a yakuza game a negative rating.
Unlike previous games some characters lack depth and are in a way less serious to previous yakuza games.

the game combat system gets very repetitive and it is very slow. for people who use to play the game only for the sake of the main story, now have to be ready to grind a lot to be on the same level as the enemy.
combat system can leave you wanting to tear your hair and smash your head against the keyboard. a third of the time you will see your character running to the enemy and back to his position.

from my readings the developers had to change the project direction, because beat em up was not attracting enough players from the japanese market, but in doing so they took one of the core elements of the game.

the fights not only in the sub story but also in the main story became way too comical, a charachter would blow a kiss to an enemy lowering their defense stats, compared to the old games where majima or kiryu would scream furiously and charge their heat to pull sick moves.

the city is impressive as always the side activites too. the graphics is great, voice acting I can not complain always on point.

big minus points are the grinding you might need to spend 8 hours or so preparing for a fight. a fight can take 45 mins to an hour sometimes and it is less exciting and extremely repetitve, you would skip some turns with no action just to heal your charachters.

as someone who played yakuza from 0 until 7 I unfortunately might stop following the series or just watch a lets play on YouTube, because i can not put myself through a yakuza similar to like a dragon. I quit the game toward the last 3 or 2 chapters and started watching lets play while skipping the fights, during my own gameplay i left it on autopilot sometimes until fights finished and then I came back.",2,False,"Aug 24, 2021"
Yakuza Like a Dragon,1121910,hertzian68,"This game is a mixed bag but overall it's a banal excuse of a yakuza game when taken into account the other 7 games in the series. We go from the legends and high level yakuza glory and drama with a Kiryu of dignified tragic grandeur and the other legends and their stories to childlike **** and bums with endless UI and dialogue that just crawls along. GAG. The writers LOVE orphans, they love surrogate paternal relationships, they love all types of perversions and all sorts of  videogame culture, we get it this is just over the top and does NOT fit in very well with the series as a whole. I don't play turn based combat games, it's too automatic and too UI heavy I prefer control over the experience as much as possible with the least UI in the way. One aspect of why I've played and replayed 0-6 is that it's NOT TURN BASED. This is serviceable but I did NOT play Dragon Quest so the references mean nothing to me. Ichiban seems to SHOUT his lines rather than speak and it sounds like he's on drugs lol. The larger maps are pretty empty and generic, even reworked from Y4/Y5 to my eye. I think Y6 was about 40gb, this monster is 60gb and for what? so they can shout MA MORE! BLOATED. The back stories are just not believable, although that's true for most yakuza games to be fair.

I will caveat that I'm about 5-10 hours in, and have heard lots of good things about the story, however honestly I don't really care about stories anyway unless they're unbelievable and unique. So far this feels a bit pretentious and isn't really resonating with me

Hate the autosave mechanic, derives from Dark Souls but worse and adds nothing. The map is also awful, trying to force exploration but within quite an empty, uninteresting world 
The map design is also very poor. I have spent up to an hour in several areas just trying to find stuff, leave areas or having to re-tread steps

Enemy design has very little variety and for the first 5 hours it felt like most enemies were damage sponges (although that is improving now)

Pros:
-Good visuals, although not amazing
-Combat does look cool at times 
-Interesting premise
-Music is good at some points and quite unique

-Very unintuitive

Nier Automata,524220,lastfox,"The presentation and art design are the only things that are beyond average. And I still have no clue why all the androids are dressed as gothic lolitas. It doesn't fit with the serious themes which are going deep into Neon Genesis Evangelion fanfic territory. A'other one of those open world games which is a giant elobarate fetch quest. None of the items or weapons give you a game-changing experience. Instead the Rpg elements are too rudimentary implemented, they barely affect the game. And that several side quests are blocked without further notice or option going back, unless with the next character is frustrating. Especially since certain side quest have to be unlocked on route A first. That is my whole experience in a nutshell: tedious and frustrating. Even traveling on the back of an animal feels boring. I went through the whole ordeal and finished the game with all three characters and the first ending was by far the best one. The other two added a twist and meta modernist ramblings, but I honestly didn't care since all the characters are cold and unlikeable. The game never even gives you a choice to save X but give up Y like in the Witcher 3. There's no interactive storytelling with the 26 endings, just forced cinematics to one end that is worse than the other. Also the forced themes and parallels to our society were really tired. This game wants to be super artsy and deep but at the same time throws the most stereotypical anime clichés at the player, every occasion it gets. I want my 10 hours of gameplay back and wished I would have read a good novel instead. Make no mistake this isn't a game that gives you chills, an experience or good vibes, it's just a product to waste your time on meaningless quests that have no effect on the story.",4,False,"Nov 9, 2023"

Molto bello il rapporto tra il gatto e i Robot che incontra , sopratutto la sua mascotte che spesso risulta indispensabile per progredire nella storia. Molto bella l’idea di creare una lingua incomprensibile , ma grazie al traduttore è tutto molto comprensibile anche in italiano . Saltare sui tetti , per capire come raggiungere alcuni luoghi , alla ricerca di oggetti o aiuti non risulta noioso. il suono e le ambientazioni sono ben curate ed esplorare è sempre un piacere sia per gli occhi che per la mente . Capire cosa fare risulta semplice , farlo , delle volte necessita ingegno ed investigazione , anche se non troppo difficile.

Stray,1332010,Samvell,"Probably a good game if you just wanna turn off your brain and vibe, but the game has nothing else to offer. There's close to no gameplay. You just **** around the environments the whole game. I'd say the game has a nice, relaxed atmosphere to it, but vibes can only carry the game so far.
The graphics are definitely nice. Yes, it's 2015 level graphics, but the overall art direction is great. Except for the cats themselves, which often trigger that uncanny valley feeling in the cutscenes. The music is sparse and amorphous. For the most part it felt very unintrusive, and intentionally so. I'd say it fits the game well, although there's a slim chance I'll ever wanna hear it outside of the game. I have to note though that some musical cues felt off at times. For example, there was this one time when I was just walking down an alley and this really intense ""action"" music started playing for some reason, even though there was no action going on in the game at the moment whatsoever.
The game design felt inconsistent. A lot of the objects are climbable, while others that look exactly the same aren't for some reason.
I wasn't a fan of the scripted events either. There is one early on in the game where you have to run from zurks and I failed it like four times in a row. Why? Because the moment you have to jump off the ledge you can't  press W+Space, you have to press just Space, unlike the rest of the game where W+Space works just fine. It's little inconsistencies like these that really ruin the enjoyment and leave a bitter taste in my mouth.

Dont Starve,219740,UncleEd,"Tedious game with a beautiful make-up. Don’t Starve is one of the more popular indie games of the recent years for reasons I simply do not understand. It does look charming indeed. In fact, it has beautiful Tim Burtonesque style graphics and the game easily grabs the attention of anyone who takes a look at the screenshots. You start as a character whose only goal is to survive as long as possible. Similar to other survival games, you farm, craft, build to stay alive. The first problem with Don’t Starve is that the grinding part is simply boring. Often, it feels like a flash game with a fairly bad user interface where you click, click, click with your left mouse button without having any kind of fun. If you are curious about how grinding can be fun, please check Terraria out.

Second major problem with Don’t Starve is the permadeath. I am not suggesting that permadeath is bad per se, it can be quite enjoyable when it is done right. In Don’t Starve, however, it turns the tedious game design into something unbearable. You may find yourself grinding for hours, just to die by a random encounter (and it won’t be your fault). Oh yeah, some might suggest “that’s what the game is about” or “you will learn from your death”. Just give me a break… By now you should have played plenty of difficult video games to differentiate good game design from bad ones. Just look at the Souls series. When you die, you know you made a mistake. Maybe you made your move too early. Maybe you did not block the attack when you were supposed to. And if you die, you may lose your “souls” and thereby some of your progress, but not the entire game. In Don’t Starve, unless you are playing with a second monitor with wiki open, there is no way of knowing what will kill you. The only way to learn about what kills you is to be killed by it. And then you will start over, go through the tedious grind for hours and die again for another reason you could simply not prevent. In Don’t Starve, you are Sisyphus…

Last but not the least, the combat is atrocious. Combat in Don’t Starve is literally the same combat in any of the other thousands of flash games. If you have a good armor, left click the enemy until it dies. Or alternatively, make the enemy chase you and do your attacks while you are on the run.

If dull, repetitive games with poorly executed game mechanics are for you, play Don’t Starve. If you have a friend who happens to have the same tastes as you do, play Don’t Starve Together. But if it is the art style that pulls you in, your valuable time would be much better spent rewatching The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The more you play, the more satisfying it becomes, especially during the amazing boss fights. Beating them feels great every time. My favorite boss fight was the Mantis Lords one, which almost feels like a rhythm game because of how perfectly timed everything is. The developers created a deep and fascinating lore, full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered, even though the narrative itself can be a bit unclear at times—it’s not always easy to fully understand what happened in Hallownest. The map is huge and packed with secrets, and every single area is memorable. After spending several hours in the game, you start to know your way around instinctively.

Hollow Knight was a random exploding success, a genre definer, something every subsequent metroidvania is held up to and compared with.

The sense of wonder and dread as we explore the buried kingdom, the challenge of the bosses and the platforming, the utterly stunning world and character design, and Christopher Larkin's generational soundtrack, all come together into what I dare call the prime metroidvania. This game has held strong, the lore and horrifically tragic story keeping audiences engaged for more than half a decade, and is a prime example of how love for the craft always beats the love of cash.

Omori,1150690,ThatoneHELP,"Omori, for a RPG made by a small dev team and being OMOCATS first game. Is probably one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time in the RPG aspect. Now the reason? The story, Besides the random negative reviews that sound like they were asleep while playing the game And writing the reviews. The games gameplay is fine, not anything groundbreaking but it is enjoyable. But the story, music and art (in cutscenes) is immaculate. It is the most deep game I have ever played, and I am confident that I will never forget this story, now I won't spoil anything because this is a game genuinely needed to be played blind. But if my word doesn't mean anything, you can search up OMORI on YouTube and you can see so many different YouTubers, big and small praising the game in thumbnails and stuff. It makes sense too.

The game has around 20 hours of gameplay and six years of real life development to flesh out everything from the story to the music and hand drawn and pixel art.

Now I get it, OMORI isn't for everyone, the game is rated M for a reason and it is not because of swearing, sex or violence (No Humphrey doesn't count), it genuinely gets that deep. And in MY summary? If you like RPG games OR like games or media with a good story, OMORI will GENUINELY be the closest you get to a MUST-PLAY (also it's worth the 20 dollars btw, crazy how pokemon legends ZA is 70 yet absolute dog **** compared to OMORI OR literally ANY other indie game.)

And key note, Omori in all is a serious game, so if you can't take it seriously, then you most likely won't enjoy it to the degree that everyone else playing the game did. Omori at its core is a STORY game. So I don't actually advise playing it if you don't like a good story, but if you do it's a near must play.",10,True,"Oct 26, 2025"

Omori,1150690,Anonymus97,"Let’s cut through the pastel-colored fog: Omori is a confused, clunky mess that tries to be everything and ends up being nothing. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of mismatched genres—psychological horror, quirky comedy, slice-of-life drama—all stitched together with the subtlety of a Tumblr meme dump. The tonal whiplash is real: one moment you're navigating trauma, the next you're watching a talking toaster crack jokes. It’s not clever—it’s **** controls are stiff and outdated, a relic of RPG Maker’s limitations. Movement feels sluggish, menus are unintuitive, and the interface design is more aesthetic than functional. It’s like the developers prioritized mood boards over playability.Combat? A snoozefest. The emotion system is a neat idea on paper, but in practice it’s shallow and repetitive. Battles drag on with little strategic depth, and the pacing is glacial. You’ll spend more time mashing attack than actually thinking. Compared to other indie RPGs with tactical nuance, Omori feels like a **** characters are painfully flat. Sunny, Basil, Aubrey—none of them evolve meaningfully beyond their archetypes. They exist to serve the plot’s emotional beats, not to feel like real people. Dialogue is often stilted, and the attempts at humor land with the grace of a brick. It’s the kind of writing that might resonate with someone deep in a Tumblr echo chamber, but outside of that bubble, it’s hard to take **** let’s talk about the reviews. The praise surrounding Omori is almost cult-like, centered almost exclusively on its “sad story.” But that’s the bait. The game leans heavily on trauma and tragedy to mask its mechanical shortcomings. It’s emotional manipulation dressed up as profundity. Critics and fans alike seem so enamored with the ending’s gut punch that they ignore the slog it takes to get there.",0,False,"Oct 13, 2025"

Before Your Eyes,813780,Womly,"Played a bunch more games over the past week or so, so imma write a bit about themPlayed “before your eyes” at toms cus he has vr n whatnotAll I had going into this is the selling point of the blink mechanic and the fact it might make me cry, so I didn’t really know what to ****’s hard to describe anything about the game without spoiling it so I’ll say this; the way the mechanic of blinking pushing forward time is really innovative and clever, works amazingly in VR. It’s about the POV / life **** who grows older and you see his life unfold. The start of the game you’re greeted with a ferryman who wants to hear about your life and then it’s shown blah blah, there’s some twists and turns at some point in the game yadda… basically the way the story is executed and reveals is so clever and I think the medium of vr with this blink mechanic drives the emotion home because, with blinking enabled, you forcefully don’t want to miss anything important, you wana not accidentally blink and miss out on a chunk of the story. I think playing the game with it enabled works well (I was advised to turn the mechanic off but I think it worked better having that experience). Metaphorically the “blink and you’ll miss it” idea is neat, for a story driven game you don’t wana miss out on a chunk of the person’s life or story and you don’t know what’ll happen next in their life. It’s an interesting and very emotional game, from the segments with the ferryman to the sound design, writing and voice acting it’s all ace and very emotional not only at the end, but just throughout as it throws around many heartbreaking moments so well, the littlest things are so sad to hear.Great short game and I get the hype for it.

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,apeot2002,"Life is Strange: True Colors reclaims the franchise’s strength, but its weaknesses, too.

First off, I need to declare my bias: I regard the original Life is Strange as one of the best, most memorable gaming experiences in my life. I liked the prequel “Before the Storm” well enough, mostly because it gave me more of one of my favorite characters. Life is Strange 2, however, left me cold.

So when I say that True Colors felt like a return to form for me, that is high praise. This slice of life story around another teen with with supernatural abilities (supernatural empathy instead of time manipulation) making their home in a small community inhabited by quirky, well realized character (Colorado mining town instead of Oregon coastal village) is just as engrossing, charming and gripping as the tale of Chloe and Max was.

Alex Chen, an orphan grown up in the system and our protagonist, has had a hard life, but things are looking up for her. Upon invitation by her estranged but loving brother, she moves to the small mining town of Haven Springs, and right then and there the game won me over: This very first scene is incredibly bucolic, full of life, color and golden sunlight. You can practically smell the fresh mountain air. That was the first hook that got me.

The second hit home only minutes after, when I witnessed the awkward reunion between Alex and her brother. Both of them didn’t quite know how to deal with each other and the situation, and I could read every conflicting emotion, not only in the excellent voice performances, but in their expressions and body language, too, and it all felt so true, so emotionally resonant that I couldn’t help falling in love with these two lovable, damaged humans trying clumsily to connect to each other, the captured facial animations were that good. 

These two things, colorful, joyful art direction and charming, emotionally resonant characters are the great strengths of this game, and they made playing through it a joy. Together, they convincingly create the idyllic atmosphere of a tight-knit community living in the ideal small town. Or would, if the actual plot didn’t complicate things. There is actually quite a bit of socio-political commentary to be found, if you’re open for that kind of thing.

The plot itself meanders a bit at times, but still creates room for a few incredibly moving scenes, the odd successful twist and ultimately a finale that for all its understated subtlety packs an incredible punch. Unfortunately there are a few mediocre valleys between these peaks of engagement, and a lot of them have to do with the implementation of Alex’s superpower. While the idea of Super Empathy is fascinating and is used very well during the high points of the narrative, Deck Nine struggled to create meaningful everyday applications of it. But they couldn’t let it lie either, thus Alex has to empath her way through way too many two sentence dialog sequences with no import and no emotional resonance.

As a controller-based adventure game, there are few gameplay systems to be had, and the riddles here barely deserve the name. There are precious few things to be discovered away from the beaten path. Innovation is scarce, after you’re over the incredibly improved character animations. If you are not here for the characters, the vibes and the story, you might not have a good time.

But if you are, if you want to see Alex through her journey, smile with her, commiserate with her tears, you will find it incredibly easy to fall in love with her, and with Haven Springs.

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,Ciocolici,"Life is Strange: True Colors, a game I've been eagerly anticipating, truly lived up to my expectations. As a long-time fan of LiS, I was curious to see how Deck Nine would handle this installment, given their previous work on Before the Storm, which, while decent, was just a prequel with an existing storyline. However, True Colors presented a completely original tale from start to finish, and boy, did they deliver excellently.

The gameplay remains familiar, but with intriguing new features and gameplay elements tied to the protagonist's unique power, adding a fresh twist. The choices I made felt relevant, and I relished the various options I had throughout the game. The graphics are generally fantastic, but there was one gripe that broke my immersion - witnessing sudden changes in texture quality when new objects or scenes appeared. Additionally, there were occasional instances of unexpected FPS drops that lingered for entire scenes, albeit these were rare occurrences, happening maybe three or four times in the entire game. Despite these minor issues, I must commend the breathtaking scenery and the phenomenal OST. The soundtrack, in particular, was truly outstanding, capturing that classic LiS essence. The visuals might not reach the level of DontNod's previous works, but they were still stunning, and the facial animations were incredibly impressive, surpassing my expectations even after seeing them in the trailers. Can you believe it's still LiS?

Now, onto the heart of it - this game screams Life is Strange through and through. It radiates more LiS vibes than LiS 2 ever did, and Alex, the main character, is simply the cutest, most lovable character the series has seen so far. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted and captivating. While it may not have outdone the brilliance of the first LiS, I found myself emotionally invested in Alex's story right from the first chapter (now chapters instead of episodes). Her heartrending backstory evokes empathy early on, which is a definite plus. I did sense that Life is Strange and LiS 2 were more expansive in some ways - not just gameplay or story-wise, but in terms of the world they built. True Colors felt somewhat smaller in comparison, though I still adored the story and its universe and couldn't help but make some comparisons throughout my playthrough. There were moments where I felt the final episode could have been handled better, though it wasn't bad by any means; it just had room for improvement in certain aspects, in my opinion.

In conclusion, I absolutely loved Life is Strange: True Colors. It successfully encompassed everything that makes LiS special - it was great, melancholic, intense, and captivating all at once. It captured those emotional highs and lows I've come to associate with the series, leaving me thoroughly engrossed in the story. While I personally enjoyed it more than LiS 2, it still couldn't dethrone the original LiS from its throne (no comparison with BtS or Captain, as that wouldn't be fair). More LiS games, please! I can't get enough of this world, and I eagerly await any new installments that may come our way.",9,True,"Aug 5, 2023"

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,KinimodYunmi,"Dieser Teil zerreißt einen emotional leider nicht so extrem bzw. überhaupt als in Life is Strange und Life is Strange Before the Storm. Auch die ""holy ****"" Momente, die es zumindest noch in Life is Strange 2 gab, gibt es nicht mehr. Man hat leider auch das Gefühl, dass jede Entscheidung recht egal ist, da es in normalen Dialogen kaum was ausmacht und die EINE ""große Entscheidung"" der Episode ist jetzt auch nichts weltbewegendes, die Story geht trotzdem ihren Weg, man kann dadurch nichts verhindern. Wenn man sich die Entscheidungen, wie üblich am Ende einer jeden Episode durchließt, merkt man das. Man hat lediglich die Wahl einer Person was zu erzählen oder nicht. Das juckt die Story aber nicht die Bohne, bis auf an einer Stelle, die aber auch total optional ist, danach setz die feste, unabänderbare Story wieder ein.

Es ist kein klassisches LiS, wie wir es gewohnt sind. Die schockierenden Momente, in denen man sich denkt, oh nein, das darf doch nicht wahr sein gibt es nicht, man wird emotional nur sehr gering mitgenommen und die zwei Stellen mit einer, ich sag mal Offenbarung von der Story des Spiels her, kann man sich sogar denken. Hier wurde sich darauf fokussiert mehr Gameplay einzubauen, anstatt eine extreme Story zu schreiben.

Die Story ist trotzdem schön und da ich das Spiel ein Wochenende lang genießen konnte, vor allem durch die klassische Life is Strange Musik, die immer sehr gut zur Atmosphäre gepasst hat, kann ich dem Spiel einfach keinen Daumen runter geben und freuen mich schon auf das Steph-DLC, in die ich mich auch wieder direkt verliebt habe.",8,True,"Mar 11, 2023"

Oh boy I never thought I would actually be unable to push myself to play this game. It was an absolute hellish mental torture. Daniel is just one hell of piece of **** brat childish and insufferable character. It's actually insane how insufferable he is. The relationship between Sean and Daniel is more unrealistic then having super powers, like who tf even have such patience would have to be a saint and a parent of this lil **** to actually treat him as good as Sean. Like holy mother of god couldn't they just have give us the option to abandon him and end the game early. In short, Daniel just spends the entirety of LIS2 **** up Sean's life in every way imaginable, and we're supposed to be cool with it and love him anyway, because blah blah he's just a kid. Sean's a kid too, and he sure as hell doesn't deserve all this. Anyway, I **** on this game enough, I stopped playing around midway in EP3 and the good things about this game are its amazing soundtrack and how good the art style looks. That's pretty much the only good things about it. Everything else is either average or below average like the super power of moving **** around is just inferior to what we had in LiS 1 and LiS True Colors and the story is just straight up dumb, Sean's decision is dumb and makes absolutely no sense story-wise and it's basically what the whole game revolves around. Oh and literally every single important decision is not up to you, Sean will just agree to all of Daniel's braindead moronic ideas that will keep getting you in all sorts of stupid troubles just so they can keep the story going.

As tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something I dug, and it was done wonderfully here. The setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. The ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and I am both excited for and terrified of the sequel. Hopefully it lives up to the first game's quality and ties up the loose ends it needs to. (Sidenote I include with all Telltale reviews: Telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. Variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and I enjoy them when they do pop up in Telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. They're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. They influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. The joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. I think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, I'd temper your expectations.)",10,True,"Mar 30, 2025"
The Wolf Among Us,261030,Beautifulyinsan,"Beautifully Written, Beautifully Presented. And for telltale the most Dynamic in experience, and if anything its not about branching paths with these games its about how you yourself engage with everything that will depend on what you get. and for me, the inability to not change some things is actually in the games favor, Because I would much rather have crucial points, and a focus be uncompromising. the Empathetic thoughtful and even emotion and intense writing have kept this game as the only rival to the walking dead. I just oddly wish the aggroget was higher then 80 but equally as so I see it as just, well its a perception on what is actually important in a game. For the type of game this is, its about the experience of seeing the world, seeing the position of Bigby and what happens to him, some things that you believe is more important, which again will not change everything but more or less, will change how you view everything in each subsequent play through. Your aggression and your softness, your approach to each character, it often change me, and made me feel a roller coaster depending on what I said, when I didn't keep track of what I said and whether or not this guy was gonna say the same thing anyways, I was feel the very grounded, tight and honestly intricate story that pulls no punches and containing bold plot twists. Immersive, and emotional to its absolute core, I just wish It was longer. not so short, only going 10 hours but It has no filler, just opting for you as a player to just feel everything and take your time, and feel the vibe.

Oxenfree,282140,SilverOrlov,"I gave this game an 8, but that's an advance. I really liked the game for its atmosphere, music, and of course the story itself. Lovecraft would have definitely liked this game: a short story about otherworldly horror. Maybe cosmic, maybe afterlife. Just the way he liked it. But for me personally, this game was on the verge of a 7 because walking around this island was very tiring, and because the dialogues required you to react quickly. I hate timed quests, timed traps, and timed dialogues, so for me it spoiled the feeling of the game a little. And the tedious walking could have been easily fixed with at least small fast-travel, like 4 benches in different corners of the island. And that's it. Because of this, I didn't really like running and looking for red frequencies first, and then running around the island again looking for these damn notes... and also hunting for different endings.

Oxenfree is a uniquely dynamic enigmatic narrative game that is as complex as the player's willingness to engage. It introduces characters begging to be understood despite their confounded pasts. The game challenges players to look beyond the surface, reminding us that all carry a history that shapes their present.
Oxenfree prompts players to reflect on the control we have over our lives. It's a journey through acceptance, illustrating that acknowledging the past allows for moving forward. I love how deeply one can dig for lore in this game, even extending to an ARG.

Mitigé. C'est l'émotion que je ressens à la fin de ce jeu.Mais c'est aussi celle que j'ai ressenti dès le début. Plonger dans un monde étant l'archétype même des clichés pour adolescent ca ne me grisait pas trop au début. (ma phobie les dialogues comme dans life is strange)Or, très vite le jeu a su apporter ce côté surnaturel voire même horrifique, je commençais donc à me plonger dans l'univers... je m'attendais pas à ce que l'eau soit si froide. Une grosse déception en fin de compte cette histoire et ce jeu. On est resté trop proche du jeu pour ado-bobo et ce, malgré quelques moments sympas. Cela est peut-être lié à mes choix de dialogues (non), d'ailleurs parlons de ces choix !Quelle honte, baser son jeu sur des choix mais ne laisser au joueur que 2-3 secondes pour lire les 3 choix qui s'offrent à lui, tout en devant comprendre la quantité abondante de dialogue qu'il ingurgite depuis un moment, et sans oublier la cerise sur le gâteau : les dialogues qui continuent pendant que tu dois faire tes choix sur ceux-ci. J'espère que vous serez rapides, vous avec 2 secondes, top chrono ! Non sérieusement c'est certainement la chose la plus conne que j'aie vu dans un jeu.Ajouter encore à ça un défaut terrible pour un jeu qui veut baser son expérience sur l'histoire et les dialogues : Le ""doublage"" atroce. Pas du tout au niveau pour ce jeu. Aucune émotion dégagée dans les voix. Que ce soit de la tristesse, de la peur ou de la joie, tout est plat. Dommage et fatal pour **** faut encore ajouter à tout ça, des décors pas beaux, des contrôles et déplacements relevant du supplice, et une bande son qui parfois, ne colle pas du tout avec l'ambiance du jeu. Je ne sais pas si cette contradiction est voulue, mais pour moi, c'est de mauvais gout.Cependant il y a un problème... l'ambiance globale du jeu dégage quelque chose !

I like how they put everything in place and I honestly loved how the characters got flashbacks from happy moments in the past. The background music was good and it created the typical atmosphere which fitted in the game. I really liked the genre of the game, it was spooky but at the same time pretty emotional, and the best part was that everything was unexpected. Not once could I guess what would happen next, and that's what made this game more exciting. The characters were greatly designed as well and the graphics of the game was just amazing.

Little Misfortune,1051510,PublicNuisance,"I have seen a lot of people online saying how they liked Fran Bow but didn’t like Little Misfortune due to the lack of puzzles. I can understand that because I have the opposite reaction for the same reasons. Fran Bow was a puzzle game that had a fantastic narrative while Little Misfortune is just a narrative game without the puzzles. I disliked the puzzles in Fran Bow so Little Misfortune was basically giving me what I enjoyed from Fran Bow and leaving out what I didn’t. The art style is great and carries onto the credits which is a unique one. The voice acting is fantastic. Both Misfortune and The Voice. There are moments which are sad, funny and in between and they nail all of them. Misfortune has a interesting accent and way of speaking which is a mix of child and adult. There are a lot of points which are pretty macabre, to the point where I surprised the developers took it as far as they did  but was glad they did. The nightclub full of hamsters comes to mind. I don’t think the game would have grabbed a hold of me the way it did if they had of held back. The music was also very interesting as it made me think of an Eastern European disco and a cyberpunk synth type of vibe. There isn’t much in terms of “game play” here. Most of the game is you making choices and interacting with the environment to proceed. I don’t say this as a slight against the game because the story was great. Had the story been bad then the game would have fallen apart because there was nothing else to hold it together but luckily it was good. In regards to choices when The Voice says that there are no good or bad choices, just consequences, they mean it. It made me think of the episode of The X-Files with a genie who when granting your wish would always find a way to warp what you asked for in a way you hadn’t expected. For instance a person asked for a boat and got it but then realized they would have to pay docking fees, maintenance fees and taxes on the boat that they hadn’t thought of and thus they couldn’t even use the boat that they had asked for. There are a lot of things like that associated with the choices you make in Little Misfortune so don’t try to over analyze it, the Voice will find a way to turn your choice bad regardless and I have to say that was a sadly realistic take on things from the developers. I was left with some questions such as just how Morgo was defeated; who was responsible for what happened to Misfortune; what role we the player played seeing as how the Voice talked to us as well but overall enjoyed myself. The middle part of the game had some stretches where not much happened in the story but it got past that.

I played Little Misfortune on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any bugs. There was an option for V-Sync; PostFX and resolution. Alt-Tab didn’t work. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were 3 save slots available. You could also just use the auto save feature if you wanted. You can’t pause or skip cut scenes. The game ran great with no drops in frame rate.

Graphics API: OpenGL

If you are willing to accept narrative over game play then Little Misfortune has a lot to offer. A great story; voice acting and art style. It has it’s limitations and leaves some questions on the table but overall I came away impressed. It is equal parts cute; macabre; sad; and funny. There is a demo available for those who want to try it first.

Little Misfortune,1051510,TitaniumDragon,"Little Misfortune is a walking simulator masquerading as a point and click adventure game. There are no puzzles of note here, and the game is a strictly linear path from start to finish.

I don’t have anything against walking simulators, but a walking simulator lives and dies on plot and presentation. And unfortunately, Little Misfortune falls short on both.

This is a game that is deliberately ugly. The characters are all deliberately drawn to be “off”, and everything is drawn to have a run-down and often outright creepy vibe. The main character has a veneer of innocence but obviously has had a messed up life with a messed up family, and the only really nice thing in the game – “Mr. Voice”, the voice in her head – is obviously evil, with the first thing he tells us being that Little Misfortune, the “protagonist” of the work, is going to die.

And while all of this can work if there’s a strong plot and purpose to it, honestly, this game isn’t impressive at all in that department. The problem is that Little Misfortune isn’t a particularly interesting character – she’s a little girl from a messed up family, and she is more or less the same person at the start as she is at the end. The entire plot of the game is an excuse to take us through a series of rather morbid areas while being led on by Mr. Voice, and while the game does try to misdirect us about when and how Misfortune is going to die, that’s really the only “trick” it has up its sleeve. The game is very transparent about almost everything that is really going on, and the overall morbid and gross-out “humor” that the game leans on wears on the audience after playing for only a short while. It is just too one note, and as I never actually came to care about Little Misfortune, there was nothing to connect with here.

I can’t recommend this. It is endlessly morbid, but the messed up humor of the walking simulator is basically three hours of variations on the same joke, and there is a great deal of meandering around before the work finally goes somewhere.",0,False,"Apr 3, 2021"

Однако за привлекательным фасадом скрывается настоящая катастрофа для любого игрока, который ищет качественный игровой опыт.Геймплей, от которого хочется плакатьМеханика игры построена на крайне примитивных принципах. Комбинации карт настолько предсказуемы, что уже через пару часов игра превращается в унылое повторение одних и тех же действий. Никакого разнообразия или инноваций — просто бесконечное перетасовывание одних и тех же карт.Графика и звукВизуальная составляющая оставляет желать лучшего. Скудные, однообразные визуальные эффекты и унылая цветовая палитра создают атмосферу, в которой невозможно долго находиться. Звуковое сопровождение не лучше — набор примитивных звуков, которые быстро начинают раздражать.Проблемы с балансомСложность игры распределена крайне неравномерно. Первые уровни настолько просты, что вызывают зевоту, а последующие — настолько сложны, что кажутся практически непроходимыми без использования специфических комбинаций. Это создаёт ощущение искусственности и несправедливости.Отсутствие глубиныПрокачка и развитие в Balatro реализованы на уровне казуальной мобильной игры. Никаких глубоких стратегий или продуманных механик развития персонажа.

Inscryption,1092790,johko,"I'll be honest. I was very much on the fence about whether I wanted to play the full game after trying the demo but I sure am glad I did. Inscryption is more than it appears to be on the surface and did not fail to delight me all the way through.

The card game itself is fun. It is pretty much a stripped down version of Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone, but the rogue-like campaign format suits it well as you can beef up your deck in ways that would be considered game-breaking in a traditional CCG against human players. If you ever fantasized about having OP cards in these types of games, Insrcyption can very much fulfill that fantasy. The drawback of that is that perhaps it allows a bit too much freedom; if you are at all familiar with the fundamental principles of CCGs and have some basic understanding of deck building and card value, the game will not be a challenge to you.

But I liked that. I honestly did not need the game to be challenging for it to be entertaining. I got to play it the way I wanted to play it, and that was fun for me. The difficulty curve is a bit wonky and it does somewhat lessen the impact by failing to provide a steady increase of difficulty, but this is a minor complaint on my end. The good thing is that it is highly unlikely that you will feel stuck or frustrated at this game for not being able to get through it. The focus here is on the experience rather than the challenge. Inscryption actually has a pretty elegantly integrated hand-holding system to nudge you in the right direction without being overtly obvious about it.

I have to praise the tone and atmosphere of this game. The music and sound design is perfect and the visuals set a unique, haunting tone. Even the camera movements bring about a sense of nostalgia without making the game feel clunky. There are certain parts of the game I would like to review but I am trying to keep this spoiler free, so I'll just say that it never gets boring and that there's always something new to delight your eyes and ears.

The weakest part of Inscryption is probably the ""puzzles."" A lot of these can be passed just by pure random guessing and maybe that was the point. If puzzles aren't your thing, you don't have to worry because they're quite frivolous.

Take your time with this game and savor it. Be creative. It's a good one.

Inscryption,1092790,Bahia8000,"Interesting game. Inscryption is pretty decent, an adventure that changes gameplay and art per acts, tons of secrets, fun gameplay and a interesting lore.

Gameplay wise game is divided into 3 acts that play pretty different. They are each different in gameplay and style each with its own secrets. The first act is pretty fun, explorable, filled with secrets, great art style and a nice pacing. Second one and third one are kinda spoiler ish, but they change, the second one is more about strategy, you do your deck and also have a little adventure. The third one is similar to the first but its less luck based and more skill. The first one is by far the best, well done gameplay system and mechanics, more secrets than any other act, characters, a very interesting place you can walk on and its kind of short but it hits the sweetspot.

Art style and visuals are interesting, they are done with care and suprisingly good, the first and third act have a dark tone while the second ressembles more like a classic rpg (a lot darker). I liked most of the designs and i liked how unique it looks.

Story wise, there are 2 parts. The direct one which is easy to understand, but it is kinda generic, the first act does a good job in keeping it mysterious and interesting, while the second and third kind of abandon that or at least doesnt execute it as well as the first. You have the indirect one, told trough IRL videos and secrets hidden in the game which is pretty complicated, but can be fun.

As for other stuff, OST was decent, nothing id listen but fits the game neatly and thats more than enough. Controls and gameplay is agile for experienced players but you can play it slow until you know more the stuff. 

Its a fun experience, Worth 7-10$, it doesnt last long, after whatever time you take on act 1, the others are 2 hours each, second maybe less, third, maybe more. First like an average of 3 hours, but if you like discovering secrets maybe more",7,True,"Jul 28, 2025"

Inscryption,1092790,Nazrielau05,"Act 1 :I loved the experience. Like i'm usually not into card games at all but this game's presentation and art style in general absorbed into the game almost immediately. It's dark as **** but not in a way that you couldn't see anything, you see just enough for you to put things together and try to figure out the puzzle pieces in the game. The game has this sort of gritty feel to it. I don't wanna say edgy cause it's definitely not that, but it's atmosphere is creepy and unsettling enough to make me wanna piss myself(Positive sentiment).

Act 2 :This part of the game is probably the most controversial one. It changes the presentation drastically. Even though yes the core gameplay is still the same turn based deck building card mechanics, the visuals take a huge turn here. From a heavily stylized 3D gritty horror-ish art direction, it turns itself to a pixelated 2D perspective. It was a necessary decision to build a visual direction that could explain the lore and lay out the general gameplay effectively. While i do think this visual presentation breaks the previous act's immersion and atmosphere, it was inevitable for this game to present itself in the more usual card game aethethic. BEFORE it brings you back to it's previous gritty/horror-ish atmosphere in the third act. I'm getting way ahead of myself here. But with that knowledge in mind, act 2's visual direction actually worked pretty well for a change of pace in contrast to the game's often gritty visual style.

Act 3 & overral thoughts :Absolutely my favourite part in the whole game. The visual presentation is incredibly good, the soundtrack elevates the experience, and stack it up with a genuinely well-made deck-building card game mechanics. Another thing that made this game popular is it's lore, overral story, and the Meta usage of how a video game works. They legit access some of your steam file for **** and giggles lmao i love this game. The story, the lore, and the creepy atmosphere immediately caught my attention and immersed me into the game entirely. I love it. This game is amazing.

It's problem is, simply put, that it isn't an enjoyable system, and adding the two ideas together only makes for double the number of ways that you can be unfairly executed.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,RafaelGR,"PROS

- Unlike other TCGs (Duel links etc), Master Duel is F2P. With minimal daily grind anyone can make one meta deck per month.
- Smooth Yu-Gi-Oh simulator with great visuals.
-This game managed to bring back to Yu-Gi-Oh, players that haven’t touched a single card since 10-15 years ago. Also the replay feature is a great learning tool for not top tier players.

CONS

-The game feels empty. There’s only the ranked ladder mode and the occasional event for a few days every month.
-It can be very cruel for beginners, especially those that don’t even have knowledge of the TCG.

ONE LAST NOTE

This game has a different card pool (not up-to-date) and different ban list from the TCG. Many players find that a huge minus. But I feel that this is more a plus. This way there can be more diversity in the meta (for example Mathmecks) and also avoid bad metas (Tearlament tier 0 meta)",8,True,"Feb 9, 2023"

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,Cloudzy,"I've been a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh for as long as I can remember. And while not perfect, Master Duel is fine. Any deck, if the player behind it is a good pilot, can climb the ranked ladder into Diamond. It also takes luck but we don't talk about that part. Just some broad points from playing the game for a year:

1.) For a game that's purely a multiplayer online battle simulator, the economy in Master Duel is above other popular online multiplayer games. 2.) Being a best of one format leads to more degenerate strategies like stun, obsessive amounts of flood gates, entries strategies dedicated to infinite negates, and ftks, that lead to some games being just plain unfun to play.

3.) The solo gates in my opinion do a fairly good job of not only teaching players all 6 of the summoning gimmicks, but also give players a insight to a number of different archetypes in solo mode so they can get an idea of what deck they would want to make in the game proper.

4.) I do wish there was more prominent modes besides ranked, the occasional festival, and maybe solo (if you squint hard enough.) Even with casual, team battles, and duel rooms, they either don't do anything to flaunt or show those modes off, or the only real enjoyment you can get is with friends.

5.) I wish there was more of an incentive to push in ranked. With the same rank up rewards you find in Bronze also being the rewards in Diamond, I feel like asides for bragging rights, Konami doesn't currently offer enough to sit down and grind on Master Duel.

Overall, like I started with earlier, this game is fine. There's things that I both like and dislike in this game. Hopefully in the future, Komoney can fix the flaws present in Master Duel to have it reach a new level of standards.",7,True,"Feb 2, 2023"

The majority of duels are won before they begin based on the initial coin flip, because cards are so insanely powerful, special summoning and searching mechanics are incredibly unbiqutious and deck consistency is near perfect. Win conditions these days involve going first, and special summoning a field of heavy hitting monsters with various effects that negate anything your opponent plays. The player going second, loses before they even get to play a card.

The game makes no concessions for new players, you will be dumped in with very little explanation, no ability to pause the game, and a 300 second timer to understand what your opponent is doing, make your plays and complete your turn. It's not uncommon for your opponent to pull out a 20 card combo on turn 1 to set their field up and you'll be given zero opportunity to digest this information overload.

Diplomacy might sound like it's just combat, but with a different name, but it is not so. Combat works as you'd expect from other games in the genre. Diplomacy, however, functions fundamentally different and has potentially multiple arguments you need to deal with, while also potentially dealing with or ignoring the ""side objectives"".

Griftlands,1942280,hardkot,"Deck Building Gem

Visual (8/10) I like general sci fy design and drawing characters, but card design a bit average, for example in battle deck you can find a lot of card with same dagger, also after upgrading cards they will have same picture and same design, so you need to double check description, for card game is a minus. Also music is average and almost don't change in different locations. Interface is very important in card games. So my first impression was - emm another one messy over headed interface, but after some games I can say that it's very helpful, you just need to get used yo it.

Gameplay (8/10) Gameplay is very addictive because you constantly upgrade your perks, cards, get new one and you can check different playstyles through one party. Great Idea to have more playable characters with different styles and story missions. On the other hand not so many perks are really unique and main strategy is pretty straightforward.

Story (7/10) Story is pretty average, but I really like characters. And the fact that to know full picture you need to play this game more than one time. I think that all sci-fi lovers can fnd some references to different universes.

So all in all, I like this game and still have it installed on my PC, so I can play it time to time. I definitely can recommend this game to everyone, neither you are big fan of card game, or just want to start your journey.",8,True,"Oct 8, 2022"

Negotiation battles are original but don´t add that much value to the overall experience and it´s hard to fully understand what is going on. These just drag the gameplay.

Y fuera de eso, todo lo que es la jugabilidad, la diferencia entre los distintos personajes, la mejora de los mismos y las barajas, etc. Todo ello es simplemente inmejorable, y además tiene básicamente contenido infinito, siempre puedes ir haciendo más cosas, subiendo más niveles, haciendo dungeons y cosas así aleatorias y más difíciles. Los enemigos también están muy bien diseñados, con variedad de estilos y ataques. Y, finalmente, creo que es de los pocos juegos de cartas que consiguen hacer que el posicionamiento en el mapa de combate realmente sea muy significativo, interesante y divertido.

Gráficamente el juego peca un poco en el sector de las animaciones, pero las ilustraciones de personajes y escenarios están muy bien.

Y voy a ser sincero. Lo consideré sobrevalorado en su momento, y lo sigo considerando así. Tuve que terminarme este juego a remolque. Y odio hacer eso cuando quiero jugar a un juego, pues me deja eso de que no quiero volver a tocarlo más en mi vida.
El apartado gráfico: meh, no es nada malo, pero eso no salva lo poco inspirado que está el diseño artístico.
La música: podría dedicar tiempo a escucharla, pero el resto de apartados hizo que la música quedara en un cuarto plano. Lo que me da bastante repelús son las ""voces"" que les pusieron a los personajes, ese horrible balbuceo que le metieron a Celeste es un dolor en el oído. Hace que no me tome la historia del juego en serio.
Y hablando de la historia: ni siquiera tiene una historia, sino una EXCUSA para perder mi tiempo y paciencia en este horrible juego.
El diseño de niveles: a los creadores del juego, se nota que odian los videojuegos pero les gusta sacar dinero fácil. Era buena idea combinar mecánicas de Metroidvania con diseños propios de un demente? Si este juego hubiese sido creado con mecánicas de los 90 (vidas limitadas y sin guardar partida), muchos jugones irían a sus casas con antorchas para lincharles.

Cuphead,268910,toandepzaivai,i think its an interesting and fun game the game has a lot of content to play my 4 th game but its very hard (sorry for bad English),10,True,"Oct 24, 2025"
Cuphead,268910,johko,"For years I had been eyeing the infamous Cuphead, the notoriously difficult run-and-gun platformer that made everyone throw their hands up and say ""this game is hard."" I was never all that into run-and-gun games – the only ones I enjoyed were I Wanna Be the Guy and Valorant (hah). Megaman wasn't really my thing and I always associated the run-and-gun genre with confusing hitboxes and awkward controls. I knew that Cuphead was visually stunning -- I could never stop looking at it – but I just wasn't sure if it was fun. Still, its reputation of being a truly difficult game drew me in and I gave it a shot. And it's fun. Really fun.

I'm not good enough of a writer to give Cuphead the praise it deserves in the art and sound department. It's a masterpiece. Tasteful, clever, delightful, pristine, maybe even flawless – these words come to mind when I think about what Cuphead looks and sounds like. But you knew that because you've seen the trailer and the promotional art and probably also watched some streamer or Youtuber play it. So read on to learn more about how the game actually plays.

One aspect of the game that I didn't expect to enjoy so much and also enjoy more and more as I play the game is the customizable loadout feature of the game. Being able to switch weapons, ultimate abilities, and charms seemed unnecessary at first, complicating what could have been an elegantly simple game. But I had so much fun switching out my weapons and abilities to suit my playstyle for each level that I can't imagine playing Cuphead any other way.

One of the coolest things about Cuphead is the strategic element. Make no mistake: Cuphead is first and foremost a skill-based game. You won’t be able to “strategize” your way up to the Devil if you don’t have some basic platforming skills, at least not on “regular” mode. However, I’d venture to say that you’d have an almost equally difficult time if you don’t use your brain. I went into Cuphead expecting it to be a muscle-memory trainer in that I’d just play each level that was impossibly difficult over and over again until my fingers somehow learned how to dodge every attack and get the win. But I noticed that I could make a boss considerably easier just by studying the patterns and strategizing the most optimal moves. Where are the safest areas of the screen? When is the best time to switch weapons to maximize damage? Should I hang up in the upper portion of the screen to lob torpedoes or hang back to preserve my life? I found that I could magically make certain sequences that initially seemed impossible into cakewalks just by playing smart. And that is not a bad thing. Cuphead is not only an action-packed finger gym but also a game about experimentation and creative thinking.

Now, I'm going to start nitpicking. My main gripe about the actual gameplay of Cuphead is the frustrating RNG projectile moments. If projectile A is coming at me and I jump to evade it... and projectile B launches while I'm still in my evasion arc from projectile A and collides with me, I get frustrated. Now, you might just tell me to ""get good"" or whatever because there are probably Cuphead-heads out there that can 100% the game without taking a tick of damage but at my level, I have definitely felt robbed of my life just due to bad luck. It’s not a big problem, and I get why the RNG is in there but that didn’t make it any less frustrating.

Another small detractor from the game was the order of difficulty. Maybe I found a style of gameplay that made certain bosses easier, but I felt that some bosses were way out of order in terms of difficulty. Not a huge gripe, but why is the Devil easier to beat than some of the earlier bosses?

All-in-all, I love Cuphead. My plan for this game was simply to beat it so I could tell people that I beat Cuphead. I didn’t need all the perfect scores or anything like that, I was never one to be attracted by the idea of 100%-ing a game. I was going to beat it once, write this review, and be done with it. But I’m still playing. I can’t stop. I don’t know what I’ll do if I stop playing this game.

Cuphead,268910,Coatlith,Le jeu nous propose un jeu de plateforme qui nous change des Mario très redondants avec une D.A sublime et des boss très réussis qui ont tous leur particularité. Ce côté cartoon rend sa complétion très satisfaisante d'autant plus que l'on peut y jouer à deux. Certains boss peuvent paraitre insurmontable mais comme un jeu Fromsoftware il suffit de s'accrocher pour y arriver. Je recommande d'y jouer à deux la frustration y est moins présente même si les boss ont évidemment plus de vie. En point négatif on peut tout de même noter une trop grosse différence de la puissance des améliorations disponibles et les niveaux run&gun qui sont bien en dessous des boss (même si ces  niveaux ne sont pas obligatoires au final).

Bağımsız bir ekip olan Tour De Pizza’nın ilk büyük projesi Pizza Tower, oldukça hızlı tempolu bir 2D platform oyunu. Platform türündeki diğer yapımlar arasında bile kendine özgü bir yer edinen Pizza Tower, yalnızca platform oyunu hayranlarını değil, her türden oyuncuyu kolayca kendine çekebilecek bir yapım.

Oyunda Türkçe dil desteği yok ancak zaten metin miktarı yok denecek kadar az olduğundan bu bir sorun oluşturmuyor.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Peppino Spaghetti adındaki İtalyan restoran sahibi, borçları nedeniyle dükkanını kapatmak zorunda kalır. Bu borçları ödeyebilmek için ise Pizza Tower’a girer. Yani hikâye oldukça basit ve oyunun da hikâye anlatımına önem vermemesi, bunu bir sorun olmaktan çıkarıyor.
Oyun yapısı şöyle ilerliyor: Her katta 4 bölüm bulunuyor. Bu bölümlerden kazandığınız paralarla bir boss odası satın alıyorsunuz. Boss’u yendiğinizde bir sonraki kata geçiyorsunuz. Döngü bu şekilde devam ediyor. İlk bakışta metroidvania havası verse de aslında oldukça bölüm bölüm lineer bir ilerleyişi var.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Pizza Tower genel olarak basit ama akıcı bir oynanışa sahip. Bir saldırı tuşunuz, bir zıplama tuşunuz var. Zıplarken saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “slam attack”, yukarı doğru saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “jump attack” yapıyorsunuz. Oyunu özel kılan en önemli mekanik ise koşu tuşu. Bu sayede hızlanarak hem parkuru çok hızlı geçebiliyor hem de hızlanma ile gelen mini mekani̇kleri kullanarak basit kontrolleri çok daha çeşitli hâle getirebiliyorsunuz. Kısacası: Öğrenmesi kolay, ustalaşması zor.

Savaş mekaniği de basit. Ana amaç hızlı ilerlemek olduğundan düşmanlar, neredeyse “yürüyen tuzak” gibi. Yeterli çeşitlilikleri var ve boss’lar dışında tüm düşmanlar tek vuruşta ölüyor, böylece tempoyu bozmuyorlar.

Boss savaşları ise şaşırtıcı derecede başarılı. Her boss’un iki fazı var. İlk fazda 4-5 farklı saldırı kullanıyorlar, ikinci fazda ise hem bu saldırılar hızlanıyor hem de sahaya ekstra düşmanlar ekleniyor. Sonuç: kaotik ama keyifli dövüşler.

Keşif elementleri üçe ayrılıyor: 10 dolar veren kafesler , üç gizli mini oda , önce anahtarını bulup ardından girebileceğiniz gizli oda. Kafesler ilerleme için zorunlu, diğerleri ise tamamlanma yüzdesini ve bölüm puanınızı artırıyor.

Basit yapısına rağmen, sadece bu koşu mekaniğiyle bile oyunun bu kadar eğlenceli olması , sadece belirli bir şeyi güzel yapmanın bile bazen yeterli olacağına kanıt niteliğinde.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun, elle çizilmiş hoş cartoon gibi bir sanat tarzına sahip. Mizahi tonu, karakter tasarımları ve bölüm dizaynıyla uyum içinde. Ortam tasarımları hem eğlenceli hem de tema ile bütünleşmiş.

Müzikler ve ses efektleri beklentinin üzerinde. Her parça, oyunun enerjik temposuna uyum sağlıyor. Sesler ise hem mizahı hem de atmosferi destekleyici.

️️Teknik Durum ve Performans️️

Teknik açıdan kusursuz. Hiçbir hata, bug veya optimizasyon sorunu yaşamadım.

 Oldukça hızlı ve eğlenceli oynanış
 Kaliteli boss tasarımları
 Mükemmel sanat tarzı
 Güzel mizah
 Harika ses ve müzikler

Pizza Tower, türündeki çoğu oyundan ayrılarak herkesin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım. Zorluğu aşırı değil ama kolay da sayılmaz. Bundan rahatsız olanlar uzak durabilir. Ancak farklı ve enerjik bir deneyim arayan herkesin denemesi gereken bir oyun.

Pizza Tower,1070560,ScrempBootyCall,"I didn't really want to play Pizza Tower at all because I thought it looked gross, but I promised my friend that I'd play it if they played Ghost Trick and here we are. The game does look gross but in like a sick nasty radical way. It is astounding how good it feels to move fast in this video game and I don't understand how Sonic couldn't do this for 25 years. Every part of Peppino's arsenal feels specifically made to make going fast feel like you just had intercourse in a sick nasty radical way. I love his dives and his different speedy punches they're really fun. I used to hate little things about Peppino's moveset like the way he dashes and the different ways that he throws enemies, but the more I play the game the more I am just infatuated with the way he does everything. It might be my favorite game to control behind Celeste it is so insanely good.

The animation is so incredibly amazing. If you hold down the taunt button Peppino just starts busting it down sexual style and that's chill. I love the little Tv in the top right that shows little buddy and how much character it gives him. I'm usually not paying attention because of how fast he is going but every so often I'll take a little peaksie up at the screen and this jokester will be making a very funny face! John Gutter is so fugly that it won't seem like it at first but every single other stage is an absolute feast to the eyes.

Speaking of the stages, it is amazing what lengths that they've gone to making every single one so unique. One stage you'll be running through the desert into a UFO and then you're going to space and then you're at the whims of Mort the Chicken from the hit game Mort the Chicken on the PS1 and then you're in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria and then you are in war it is so fun. A big part of the stages that I love is that the devs are not afraid to make a gimmick to fit a stage and keep it in the stage. I love Mort the Chicken as much as the next guy but I don't think he would really fit any other stage in the game, and he doesn't need to.

When I first played this game it was a very low 8 out of 10, then after a bunch of time playing it was a 9 out of 10, and at the very moment everything finally clicked it became one of the easiest 10 out of 10s that I have ever experienced.",10,True,"Jul 9, 2025"

Pizza Tower,1070560,OnlyOneHere,"This game currently ranks #1 in Top 150 highest rated Steam games of 2023 by game reviewers. I had to see what the fuss is all about, only to find out that this is nothing more than a generic 2D platformer. The pizzas with the red lips make annoying noises. The running animations are very cringeworthy. The pizza guy always makes incredibly cringeworthy faces. To make matter worse, there is a stupid TV on the right-top corner where the pizza guy makes even cringier faces. When you pass a level, there is music that is extremely cringeworthy. It is over-exaggerated and tries too hard to be upbeat in a pathetic attempt at making players excited when they win. It didn't make me excited in the slightest. All this cringe made me grab my monitor and slam it against the floor out of frustration. There is no multiplayer, but I didn't expect one at a cheap price. Did I say cheap? The greedy developers are charging $20 for a flash game. I immediately refunded this garbage after nearly 2 hours. I don't want to torture myself any further with this garbage. Besides, there are plenty of free flash games on the internet. I don't recommend this game at all, unless you like looking at cringeworthy faces literally every second. ● P.S. I originally wrote this review back in early 2023, so that's when it ranked #1 on Steam and I had to see what all the fuss is about.

I have 0 faith on these lazy and greedy devs, so that was the plan. But after the deletion of this review, I'll postphone my departure. I'm not letting you toy-collecting millennials get away with controlling the narrative, and I'll let these devs know why it's a mistake to listen to you. I'll make sure they develop a highly successful $70 game (regardless if I like it) that will trigger the nerds, before I quit gaming for good. Anyways, I slammed my monitor because of this game.

Devolver çatısı altındaki bağımsız stüdyo Sabotage’ın ilk oyunu olan The Messenger, 8-bit , 16-bit retro tarzında ninja temalı bir platform oyunu. Özellikle Celeste tarzı zorlu platform oyunlarını sevenlerin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Ninja köyümüzde sakin bir gün geçirirken şeytanlar saldırıya geçer. Tam her şey bitecek derken, Batının Kahramanı ortaya çıkar ve saldırıyı durdurur. Ardından bize bir parşömen vererek bunu dağın tepesindeki Üç Bilge’ye ulaştırmamızı, dünyanın kaderinin buna bağlı olduğunu söyler. Biz de bu yolculuğa çıkarız. Kısaca bu şekilde , oldukça basit görünen bir hikayesi var.

Oyun, başlangıç , final ve arada görünen minik sinematikler dışında hikâyeyi pek doğrudan anlatmasa da çevresel detaylarla derinleşen, özenle kurgulanmış bir yapıya sahip. Klasik bir kahramanlık hikâyesi gibi görünse de, aslında çok daha farklı , şaşırtıcı ve derin bir yöne evriliyor.

Oyunda bir “sahte son” bulunuyor. Gerçek sona ulaşmak için tüm collectible’ları toplamak gerekiyor. Ancak bu, diğer oyunlarda olduğu gibi sadece küçük bir ek sahneyle bitmiyor; oyunun içinde mantıklı bir şekilde açıklanıyor ve tatmin edici bir şekilde işleniyor. Bu yüzden 'sahte son' ve 'gerçek son' olarak 2 farklı sonun varlığı bu oyun içerisinde oldukça mantıklı bir hale açılıyor.

Harita tasarımı, başlangıçta lineer tarzda olsa da oyunun ilerleyen kısımlarında metroidvania tarzına dönüşüyor. Başlangıçta geçtiğimiz her yerden yeni bölgeler açılınca sanki yeni bir oyunu oynuyormuşsunuz hissi veriyor.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyuna başladığında oldukça basit bir side scroller aksiyon platform oynadığınızı hissettiren bir oynanışa sahip oyun. Genel olarak mekaniksel derinliği oldukça sıradan oynanışı basit bir yapım gibi. Bu açıdan oyunun oldukça basit ve öğrenmesi kolay bir oynanışı olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Ama oyunun ikinci yarısından sonra , oyunun mekaniklerinin zirve noktasına çıkmasıyla birlikte oldukça Celeste seviyesinde kaliteye sahip bir platform oyunu oynadığınızı hissediyorsunuz. Yani kolay başlayan ama mekaniksel olarak fazla gelişen bir yapısı olduğu söylenebilir.

Başta dediğim gibi oyunun gerçek sonuna ulaşmak için belirli şeyleri toplamamız gerekiyor. Bu toplama işlemi ise Celeste'teki özel bölgeler ve çilekler mantığında. Normal oyundaki platform oldukça ortalama zorlukta iken bu toplamamız gereken item'ları almak için yapmamız gereken platformlar oldukça zor ve oyunun mekaniksel derinliğini uç noktalara kadar kullanacak şekilde dizayn edilmiş.

Harita tasarımı başta oldukça sade , sadece aralarda gizli odalar bulduğun gizli odalarla ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra metroidvania'ya dönen bir yapıya evriliyor ve oyunda daha önce gittiğiniz her bölgeden yepyeni bölgeler ortaya çıkıyor.

Düşman çeşitliliği az ama yerinde. Gereksiz sayıda düşman yerine, platform tasarımını öne çıkaran bir denge tercih edilmiş. Her bölgenin kendine özgü teması var ve çoğu bölümün sonunda kaliteli, çok aşamalı boss dövüşleri bulunuyor. Bu boss'ların kalitesinin oldukça üst seviyede olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Hepsi genel olarak 2 ya da 3 faza sahip şekilde tasarlanmış ve birbirinden tamamıyla farklı tarzda boss'lar.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun kendine özgü çok güzel bir sanat tasarımı kullanmış. Oyunun başında oynadığımız karakter ile oyun 8-bit eski tarzda ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra oyun karakteri 16-bit tarzla değişen bir şekilde tasarlanmış. Böylelikle çok güzel bir görüntü çeşitliliği ve kendine haslık yaratılmış. Zaten retro havasını oldukça benimseyen bir yapı olduğundan animasyonlar ve genel tasarım oldukça buna bağlı kalmış ama aynı zamanda modernliği de hala kendinde barındırmakta.

Müziklerin oldukça kaliteli olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Her bölgeye özel birden fazla müzik bestesinin yapıldığı ve hepsinin belirli bir kalite seviyesinin üstünde olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

Oyunun en iyi yaptığı şeylerden biri mizah. Mizah ise oyunun en güçlü yanlarından biri. Dördüncü duvarı sık sık kıran, absürt ve kendini ciddiye almayan bir anlatımı var. Cidden çok özel bir yapım.

Çok Oyunculu ve Ek İçerikler 

Oyun bittikten sonra bedava olacak şekilde 3 boss dövüşünün ve 2 farklı bölgenin eklendiği bir DLC'ye sahip. Bu DLC genel olarak oyunun yaptığı seviyede bir kaliteyi korurken aynı zamanda kendine özgü ana oyunda hiç görmediğimiz çok mükemmel mekaniksel değişiklikler de getirmiş.

The Messenger,1276390,Korelis,"A cute retro-style indie platformer, just like many other games in this genre. But oh boy does this game feel different. First, let's begin by what really matters : gameplay. This game is really fluid, with quick but still precise movement. The characters are a masterpiece of design, with their own sense of humour, quite absurd yet very effective. The time travel mechanic, with this completely different 16-bit style is a great game mechanic, that allows for exciting challenges. The Metroidvania part where the levels that you got through in a classic left-to-right 2D platformer show much more depth is a great idea, although some may find it a bit repetitive. And finally, the OST. Probably one of my favorites OST, with this 8-bit style music that where most songs ended up on my playlist. The NewGame+ mechanic also allows for some replayability if you really enjoy the game.
In conclusion, The Messenger is definitely a great game, and itreally is worth your time.",10,True,"Oct 25, 2023"

The Messenger,1276390,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) The Messenger es un juegazo. Y es que cuando lo empiezas te esperas que es un plataformas más, que está entretenido, pero ya está. Créeme que no. Por si acaso quieres jugarlo, va a contener spoilers la reseña, así que te recomiendo no seguir leyendo o leer sabiendo las consecuencias. Después de esa parte plataformera, el juego se convierte en un metroidvania sobresaliente que también combina de forma magistral la exploración y el plataformeo, haciéndolo un indie maravilloso. Voy a hablar largo y tendido, así que poneros cómodos y empezamos.Jugablemente, es una maravilla. Al principio nos presenta un plataformas de juego de los 80 que está bastante bien. Un diseño de niveles bastante bueno, bastantes mecánicas que hacen a cada zona única, unas boss-fights increíbles y unos controles y mecánicas de movimiento sobresalientes. Hasta aquí, el juego está bastante bien, pero es que en un momento el juego pega un giro tremendo y ahora sorpresa, puedes viajar en el tiempo y tienes que recorrer todas las zonas como si de un metroidvania se tratase. Esto puede sonar a extensión artificial. Pero es que aquí reside el núcleo y mejores partes del **** exploración que se luce The Messenger es una barbaridad. Recorrer los mundos es una gozada (gracias a las anteriormente mencionadas mecánicas de movimiento y controles) y realmente sientes que hay muchas cosas por hacer en zonas que son realmente pequeñas. Los sellos de poder, por ejemplo, expanden la exploración una barbaridad y nos permiten tener retos más difíciles apartados de la historia principal. Pero de la mecánica principal que quiero hablar es de los viajes en el tiempo.Estos nos permiten alternar entre los 8 y 16 bits (cosa que le da un toque cómico al juego) y así cambiar el entorno en el que estamos. Esto al principio no se nota mucho, pero la mecánica se desarrolla muchísimo a lo largo del juego, basando muchos puzzles del entorno solo en cambiar de tiempo para poder avanzar o teniendo hasta mecánicas únicas en una línea que no hay en la otra. Donde más me han gustado las ideas a mí ha sido en el futuro. Siento que hay más variedad de jugabilidad, las boss-fights son sobresalientes y tiene mecánicas únicas que lo hacen diferente.Audiovisualmente, es un 10. El juego visualmente es incrreíble, tanto en el estilo de 8 como en el de 16, ofreciendo un diseño de zonas, enemigos, personajes y de todo. Pero es que ya la banda sonora de este videojuego no tiene ningún tipo de sentido. No entiendo cómo alguien puede hacer temazo tras temazo y encima dos versiones y que todas queden bien. Es una barbaridad. Encima mientras juegas, es como volver a los 80/90. Increíble.Narrativamente, es donde me parece que más flojea The Messenger. No está mal y de hecho la trama me ha gustado bastante, pero cómo se cuenta la historia es un poco raro. Sí que es verdad que los personajes están muy bine hechos y tiene un humor bastante bueno, pero la historia se concentra sobre todo en el final, haciéndolo un poco extraño. Aunque lo compensa también con pequeñas historias que están bien. Está lejos de ser malo en este apartado, pero simplemente, es donde peor está el **** resumen, The Messenger es una obra maestra moderna. Que no te deje engañar ese estilo simple y de los 80 o te parezca que va a ser un juego retro, porque estás ante una carta de amor al medio y a los juegos clásicos, que sabe innovar en lo suyo y ofrecer un juego diferente y divertidísimo que te enganchará hasta que te lo pases. Un must-play sin ningún tipo de duda",9,True,"Mar 29, 2024"

The Messenger,1276390,Babutto,"Pros.:
- Great characters and dialogues.
- Great idea of platformer then mutating into mild Metroidvania.
- Weapons - not many but effective.
- Mechanics mostly are intuitive.
- So many Easter Eggs about previous franchises and games (Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads at least).
- Friendly to achievement seekers.
- Special secret areas.

Cons.:
- I hated that ""hit"" jump. Why didn't do normal double jump? Because of that some seal areas are quite annoying.
- Phantom and Muse - I found these names quite lame for the characters. But it's personal thing.

The game is awesome. Buy and play :D",9,True,"Feb 26, 2023"

Thoughts-
Ultimately, however, Shovel Knight Dig manages to pull off just about everything it was going for. The new roguelite gameplay loop works quite well with the protagonist’s limited-but-adaptable move set, and the game does as much as it can to engender the “one more run” mindset.

The main game alongside with its DLC Lost Chapter is outstanding.
The title of the game says what’s happening in the game - Shapes and **** how these shapes and beats are executed is magnificent.
Gameplay provides player with a huge variation of colorful and challenging level, yet there’s a casual mode, but I find original difficulty fair and giving player a satisfaction upon defeating a boss or difficult level.
Unfortunately I cannot say something like that about lore or story, the only thing I can say it **** it only serves as justification of gameplay.
Soundtrack is consists of lots of cool songs from some famous musicians such as Bossfight, Chipzel, Nitro Fun, Shirobon and **** the soundtrack is magnificent.
Also these arguments also perfectly fit DLC, but I’d like to add that Undertale Easter eggs, and even a whole level called Spider Dance is pleasing to see.

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,DragonHeart000,"I first heard about this game from a YouTuber I watch on his Favorite Game Animation of 2018 video. When I saw it there I found it kinda interesting, how can a 2d game with just simple shapes be considered one of the best-animated games of the year? I looked a bit more into the game and figured the concept seemed fun and it had some songs I like so I bought it to give it a try and boy was it worth it.

First off Just Shapes & Beats 100% deserved that spot on New Frame Plus's video. The animations are sublime. You'd never expect to see simple shapes convey such personality but Berzerk Studio does it so well! Everything in the entire game is just loaded with personality and creativity to the point that you can just get a feel for the dev team behind it and how much they enjoyed it themselves.

The only negative note I have on it is that my typical rule of thumb is that I get 1 hour per $1 I spend but in this game, I beat story in 4 hours. Typically this would make me more hesitant to recommend but with how beautifully crafted it is I am totally fine with letting this one issue slide. This issue could also be taken care of if the devs release a way to make custom maps, this would become one of my most played games if that was a thing.

Unrailed,1116740,LT_Gruber,"Fun game with fresh concept.

(Played via Remote Play)

There are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. However, Unrailed! has something unique. You need to transport a train from point A to point B, while completing the tracks under its wheels. 

You need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. The multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task.

After each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. However, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track.

When your little train crashes, it is game over. All progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. 

Unrailed! uses simple, ""Minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. The character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving.

The sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background.

Control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn.

Благодаря динамическому изменению местности и разнообразию препятствий каждая игра остается уникальной и заставляет вас снова и снова возвращаться за новыми вызовами.
Однако, несмотря на все свои достоинства, Unrailed! страдает от отсутствия глубины геймплея после нескольких часов игры.

I like some weapons better than others. As I said, this game is not for the faint-hearted. But if you are faint-hearted and you already got it, here's some things to remember before you commit to hating the game:Even if you have your favourite weapon, it will slowly become less and less powerful as you go on. The further you go, the more powerful the enemies and items are, the items you have become relatively weaker. You can still find stronger versions of your items later on, don't get too **** can't choose all of the scrolls. Sure, the extra health is nice but it makes you much weaker in terms of weaponry. Are you forbidden from getting one or two from the scrolls you aren't maining? No. But just pay attention to your weapons and mutations, which class are they? Mutations and damage are affected by scrolls, not just **** you die, it's okay. The fun is not in beating the game but playing it. The story is interesting if you pay attention but it is not the best story ever written. You shouldn't be playing the game for the story, you should be playing it for the action. If you die, it's an opportunity to play again.",10,True,"May 29, 2025"

Dead Cells,588650,RandomBolt,"This feels a similar game to play compared to PSO or Diablo, when it comes to how you progress.
You get some pre-determined buffs after X deaths and collect cells to unlock upgrades.

What does not look the same is that the randomness aspect means you have to slog through the same dungeons looking for the way out, instead of getting to the new areas fast, as on more classic RPGs. The areas just do not change enough to be interesting.
It is the same type of upgrades scattered, same type of enemies, just spwaned differently.

There is a pretty big lean into increasing difficulty through not restoring your life, which can make this incredibly frustrating. There is not much room in the combat to feel you are getting better, it is much more related to what you pick up and what upgrades you can keep unlocking.

The massive christmas lights also don't help with enemy visibility and further deter from the combat being interesting.

Collectively, this has been the most frustrating game I've played in years.

The levels became more and more maze-like where it becomes less of a platformer and more of a search for the right path by revisiting the old areas over and over again.

The build system is the same - there's no variety or depth to the build - you choose one thing and focus on that for the entire run, because if you try to focus on multiple things, you won't have enough damage.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,MostaS,"Recently, I gave Deadcell another go, but unfortunately I found that the game's mechanics ran out of steam rather quickly, and that there was too much linearity in the game's progression, based on collecting cells to unlock upgraded items. This meant that I had to finish the game several times to see what would happen next, and then start again with an extra level of difficulty. After 1 or 2 days, I'd get fed up, drop the controller and never want to pick it up again to continue the adventure, and it was the same with Darkest Dungeon...

FTL is the only roguelike to have kept me going for more than 135 hours. And it's the one with the least scenery, and no carrot for upgrading your ship post-mortem. It's a game that demands insane creativity and great foresight to optimize your ship and the confrontations. All the elements that make up the game are both original and complement each other so well that it's hard to get bored even after hundreds of hours. The possible combinations and strategies are virtually unlimited, making each game unique! That's why, in my opinion, FTL is one of the best roguelikes ever released.

The uniqueness of each game, which forces you to think and find the best strategy to optimize your ship, making every run unique.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,Molok,"FTL is composed of wide variety of possible scenarios that are arranged randomly to create a unique run. Each play is distinct and creates a personal story of individual player's struggle. Here is just another one of them.

I started with federation cruiser. Defying odds I progressed through increasingly difficult sectors before arriving to the Nebula under the control of Slugs. There I resolved a few challenging combat scenarios, taking heavy damage because I didn't encounter any appropriate equipment and didn't really have an opportunity to upgrade weapons in earlier sectors. Luckily I found one more advanced weapon in stock, randomly found earlier. But I couldn't power it yet, needing a separate upgrade. With that in mind I pressed on. Eventually I arrived at a sector that housed a planet with several moons. The slug found on the surface quizzed me about the number of natural satellites orbiting the planet and taking advantage of my momentous distraction stole some of my missiles, drone parts, all of my exp and most of my remaining fuel. With exp gone and without a way to upgrade my system I didn't have realistic way to win future altercations but I pressed on.
I encountered a dangerous ship. I disabled shields using my remaining missiles so I could actually damage systems using my pitiful lasers. All of my shots missed and I without ammo I couldn't switch to missile weapons. I dropped the shields, disabled the weapons, ordered all of doors opened to vent the ship of oxygen and concentrated the crew in one large chamber so they would suffocate. After they slowly and (I hope) painfully died I uninstalled the damn game.

FTL is based entirely on your luck. It is a digital version of Russian roulette. Some weapons, augmentations and systems are just better than others. If you luck out and get them advancing through the game becomes trivial. If you do not it is impossible.
I understand that it is alluring to some people as they like the risk. But I would advise anybody who likes to have any actual agency to stay away from the game.

There are achievements that you can collect and unlock bonus ships. Unfortunately a standard run seems to be at least two hours long and if you die before getting an achievement you don't unlock anything. In that case each minute of your life spent playing is retroactively wasted away. There is absolutely no payoff if you lose. A standard tagline for rogue-lites is ""Losing is fun"". But this game simply isn't fun.

On the other hand soundtrack is awesome. I would say that if you can get it without the game it's worth buying. Just don't buy FTL and don't give it any bump in it's statistics.",1,False,"Apr 24, 2021"

Enter the Gungeon,311690,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) Soy bastante principiante en esto de los rogue-lites, pero sé que Enter the Gungeon es un gran referente del género. Y después de jugar durante 10 horas, entiendo por qué. Enter the Gungeon es un juegazo que lleva muy bien el género. Ahora voy a hablar en profundidad del juego así que, **** Enter the Gungeon, tendremos que explorar las Armazmorras, unas dungeons de toda la vida solo que tienen como temática (intentad adivinarlo) las armas. Se dividen en varias recámaras, y en cada una hay diferentes enemigos, tipos de sala y jefes. Jugablemente es una locura. El sistema de combate es sin duda lo mejor, teniendo en cuenta que han hecho un sistema de apuntado que funciona muy bien para ser en 2 dimensiones. Al sistema de combate se le añade la profundidad de objetos (tanto activos como pasivos) y de diferentes armas (algunas muy graciosas por cierto) que hacen cada run realmente única. Los enemigos y bosses de las mazmorras (aunque me quedan muchos por descubrir, sobre todo jefes) están bastante bien y tienen maneras muy diferentes de combatirse, por lo que acabas haciendo estrategias para cada enemigo o boss del **** diseño de mazmorras del juego me encanta. Están se crean procedimentalmente (o en idioma normal, aleatoriamente) haciendo todo tipo de combinaciones. La progresión en estas también se siente muy natural, teniendo muchos tipos de salas que se van desbloqueando poco a poco y haciendo que cada run pueda tener algo de importancia, desde encontrar un nuevo NPC o conseguir un nuevo objeto que no habías visto nunca. El hub principal (que se llama la Brecha) también está bastante bien, aunque siento que es un proyecto muy a largo plazo (como todo el juego en realidad) pero que se siente muy bien al avanzar un poquito.Audiovisualmente, está muy bien. En el apartado gráfico, el juego tiene un estilo artístico muy bonito, que aunque sea pixel-art (algo que ya tenemos sinceramente todos muy visto) es muy bonito, con un diseño de personajes, enemigos y zonas espectacular y animaciones bastante buenas también. Y la OST del juego es una pasada. La verdad que tiene temazo tras temazo y me ha sorprendido mucho en este aspecto.Como me queda mucho narrativamente que ver (aunque puedo decir que los personajes que he visto me han gustado mucho y que el humor aunque a veces sea un poco absurdo, está bastante bien) termino la reseña diciendo que Enter the Gungeon me gusta muchísimo.

Enter the Gungeon,311690,Mene0,"This game is very good, however, it tries very hard to be more difficult and less fun than it is, especially with the random elements.
While the enemy patterns and boss fights are pretty much skill based, your experience each run varies WIDELY based on the items you get. Some items are great, some are just fine and the vast majority are borderline useless and unfun. I cannot express enough how much more fun rainbow runs are, because you can get some cool weapons and items and just experience more of what the game has to offer you. A lot of the time in regular runs I realized I just wasn't having fun because I'd take a lot more time to clear floors and bosses because I had to use the default weapon, or some terrible item and gun and run out of ammo for it. The ammount of times I'd restart a run on floor one/two because I got 3 D-C quality weapons in a row is more than I can remember.
This is not to mention a bunch of hidden mechanics and item descriptions and synergies left intentionally vague that will just result in you opening a wiki to see what it does.

The soundtrack is charming i guess, but none of them are anything to write home about.This game's strongest quirk is the mechanics. It's basically a 2D platformer game with metroidvania and rogue-like sauces. Also, in the start of each run, the game gives you an option to pick between 3 characters. These characters have their own class, abilities and quirks. Guess what? You don't control what you get. You only get to choose between whatever options you're presented ****'s not like Dead Cells where you could buy and sell weapons when given the option. It's not like Hades 1 & 2 where you get to put together your own build, combining weapons, boons, and other abilities and you stick with them for the rest of the game. In Rogue Legacy 2, your choices are basically locked in whatever the game's RNG is feeling like. This game does have permanent progression in the forms of upgrading your characters' health, armours, unlocking new characters etc. But the very core of the game's mechanics is still randomly generated. You're not fully in control of your runs.This game is heavily reliant on RNG, which in itself isn't a bad thing. However, it does kinda ruin my lust to 'master' the game's mechanics. Simply because I'm not in control of everything available. Rogue Legacy 2's premise is very arcade-like. Which makes the game perfect for pick-up-and-play whenever you want. Rogue Legacy 2 is a good experience still, and i won't deny that. It's just a very different type of Rogue-like compared to what I'm used to. Of course, that doesn't make this game bad or anything.

Monster Train,1548850,Saume,"This is a great deck builder.

The concept of combining 2 classes (or races) is always great and underused in games. It leaves so many potential combos, and surprisingly many of them work well. Each race has their unique cards and combining 2 races' cards leaves some interesting potential combos.

Runs include a card selection after every encounter, as well as 2-3 activities of choice, including various types of shops, recruiting a unit, removing cards from your deck, copying a card in your deck, relics, special events, etc.

There are also ""challenges"" that you can toggle on or off on some encounters to increase your reward, but also difficulty. These can be interesting because the extra rewards is not always worth it depending on the circumstances.

This feels more complex than Slay the Spire and you need to manage which units you put at the front, which units on which floor, which enemies will skip a floor, etc. This is not that similar to Slay the Spire though, as you don't directly control a hero that attacks & casts spells, you summon units & use spells from the ""outside"".

Monster Train,1548850,Sepherim,"Monster Train es un juego bastante entretenido, a medio camino entre roguelike deckbuilder y autobattler. La idea es que vamos por el mapa escogiendo rutas aleatorias y formando el mazo, más o menos lo esperado. Pero las batallas se luchan jugando cartas en los distintos pisos del tres y luego dejando que las criaturas invocadas luchen automáticamente según sus posiciones. Los enemigos intentan matarnos y sobrevivir hasta llegar a la parte alta del tren, nosotros intentamos evitarlo y matar al boss. Hay cinco mazos de juego en el juego básico y lo cierto es que son muy distintos entre sí, dando pie a jugabilidades muy diferentes y estrategias muy originales con algunos de ellos; y, como se pueden combinar siempre en parejas, da para interesantes combos. Los enemigos y bosses quizás no son tan variados como podrían haber sido, pero cumplen bien su labor. Quizás lo que más me falla es la falta de una historia que anime a seguir jugando, ya que no hay historia como tal.

Gráficamente el juego no es ningún portento, especialmente en las animaciones que son bastante flojas, pero cumple con una estética llamativa y colorida. La música también cumple, sin grandes aspavientos, lo mismo que los efectos sonoros. Y, al menos en mi tiempo jugándolo, no me he encontrado ningún bug.

Besides, top players frequently achieve a low win rate on StS A20 Heart runs (sometimes 25% win rate, and that is the best players in the world). To me, that is not just difficult, but in many ways impossible. In Monster Train,a run is almost always winnable - if you play perfectly. And to me, that's much better, as if I lose it was my fault! Long story short, it's plenty hard and well worth your time, just go straight for Covenant wins to start unlocking the highest difficulty where (imo) the game truly shines.",10,True,"Oct 9, 2021"
Monster Train,1548850,savvym,"Monster train is a turn based card strategy where you fight your opponent inside the train, protecting the Spyre. It's very much like Slay the Spire with extra layers to the combat system. It's also less RNG as you know where you're heading to.

Each run starts by selecting one of two (three in total) superpower options for the champion and an artifact of our choice. There is also a temple (from DLC) which allows us to gain artifacts and various rare upgrades for an additional difficulty.

Our goal is to get through 9 rings of frozen hell in a monster train; that is 8 battles if we get to the final boss.

Each combat starts off with deploying your champion unit against waves of enemies. Most of the time, the enemy boss will be flying between the floors deploying some distractions and joining the forces at the last wave into the combat phase or simply spawn last. Until that time you're supposed to fill up all floors with units and buffs to survive.

The boss destroys the floor once it clears it from our units and it means we have less space to put units and less turns to beat the level. If the spyre falls, it's game over. Luckily, spyre still shoots back so it can serve as a 4th floor well if you've got dazed cards and increase its strength. We can also upgrade our Spyre with additional damage, armor, health and apply dazed to enemies entering it.

The cards have various effects and can be upgraded, having 2 upgrade slots by default. The best part is 5x duplicating double, triple or even quadruple upgraded cards but having so many upgrades on one unit is uncommon. Each unit takes up space in the floor so when they're full we can use magic on top of it, and it's wise not to have too many units without enough buffs because they will be easily wiped out in the late game so there should be a nice balance.

Another great feature is the alliance. We get to receive cards from two races depending on which railroad we choose or when we receive after battle rewards. We can make useful synergies, but sometimes allied cards just do not fit with our main one and only take up valuable space in our deck, but we can still get rid of them.

Between battles, there are events like merchants for units, spells and artifacts, special caverns, duplicate hellvents, remove vortexes and health wells. We can even gain an extra gold. And the best part is, we can preview our run from start to finish, however we do not know the outcome of special events. So it is always wise to first take gold, buy upgrades, visit cavern, and then take artifacts, duplicate and regain health.

Apart from those, we will be able to upgrade our champion 2 more times, once in mid and once in late game. We can have as many different artifacts as we get. They make the run easier in a way.

Early game offers 5+1 champions, starting at level 1. We can also play Daily Challenges which are always Covenant 1. That is where the PvP element comes in. We can create our own runs and share them with friends. Our rankings are saved after we finish the run. We can also play simultaneously with other players at the same time, being only time limited.

In mid game, we unlock the second champions and higher covenant ranks, probably reaching covenant 10 and getting used to all of the races in the game and learning some useful strategies. Now it is about making the perfect decks with a bit of luck from rewards.

We will understand the whole concept of the game once we reach Covenant 20. Upon reaching 25, we gain even more difficult challenges that are usually available to mix up in custom games. The game is significantly more challenging than Covenant 1 and we can even easily lose the first battle with all challenges accepted.

The game has a very high skill ceiling and me as an occasional card player, now only became an addict thanks to this game. I usually gain half or third of the best players ranked in the daily and custom challenges.

There are 5 races + 1 in the Last Divinity DLC;
Hellhorned - high damage multi strikers, rage and armor gainers focused on melee combat.
Awoken - high health gainers, multi strikers and sweepers with abilities to draw more cards.
Stygian Guard - incanters, frostbiters and spell users, low melee damage and starting HPs.
Umbra - unit eaters, lifestealers, damage shield gainers, a lot of small units, late high stats.
Melting Remnant - stealthers focused on resurrecting units and slow stat and gold gainers.
Wurmkin - eggs and worms, echo infusers, focused on making the floors magically strong.

Every run is unique, we can replay the same alliances and get different starting decks and meet different bosses.

There are 3 major bosses and 12 minor bosses; they are accompanied by many heavy and support units. There is also a bonus level with 1 more boss but I only got there once.",10,True,"Jul 12, 2021"

With minimalistic controls but deep progression systems, it’s easy to pick up and hard to put down.Developed by Luca “poncle” Galante, this indie gem began as a small solo project in 2021 and exploded into popularity thanks to its affordable price, nostalgic Castlevania-inspired art, and wildly satisfying gameplay loop. What starts off slow quickly turns into chaotic bullet-heaven mayhem, with the screen packed with colorful enemies, projectiles, and loot. Despite its visual simplicity, it’s mechanically rich, offering endless combinations of characters, weapons, power-ups, and unlockable **** game constantly rewards experimentation and persistence. Each run earns gold that you can use to unlock permanent upgrades, characters, and relics, and players are encouraged to explore different builds and gameplay modifiers. Its DLCs (both paid and free) continue to expand the content with new stages, characters, weapons, and crossover content from franchises like Castlevania, Among Us, Contra, and SaGa.Content-wise, the game now includes local co-op, mobile cross-platform versions (with ads), and ports on nearly every major platform—including Tesla cars—and even has a live-action film adaptation in the works.With nearly 53 hours of playtime, one player likened the experience to a serotonin bomb, comparing it to the addictive mind-control game from Star Trek.

There are tons of its own categories within those that give different set bonuses for using that class of weapon, and different weapons with some different abilities within those, but they all feel the same when you play.

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,Atratzu,"-Quick Review-Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in 2015. Crypt of the NecroDancer combines all the elements of a 2D Top-down Roguelike with procedural generated levels, picking up different weapons gear and items to make your “build”, all the while digging through walls and battling monsters in an underground dungeon to the beat of the music.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: At the start of the game, there’s a cutscene of the first playable character named “Cadence” digging in a graveyard to uncover the truth of her long-lost treasure-hunting father. She falls underground and the NecroDancer steals her heart and forces her to move to the rhythm of the **** Cadence plays through the acts, she will unlock new characters which will have different quirks, some helpful, some not so helpful, for example one character has infinite bombs, and another character can’t attack at all.

Gameplay: Movement is up, down, left, and right, some items require you to tap two directions at the same time, like down + left to drop bombs, and up + left to use an item (The Steamdeck assigns buttons rather than directional inputs. This game is great on Steam deck by the way). You attack by moving in the same direction as an enemy or attackable **** the previous mentioned movement must be done at the rhythm of the music, if you miss or skip the beat your character will NOT be injured however you’ll be at a “disadvantage”. You lose your gold multiplier, and the rest of the dungeon will move around you to the beat of the music, sometimes you’ll miss a critical turn and die because the monster got an extra turn. I have used this to my advantage once or twice… but the game definitely rewards and incentivizes the player to move with the **** experience at the start of each zone was “Oh no… there’s no way I’m going to figure out how to play this game”. Then after playing and dying on the same level for a bit, I’d make progress and get lucky with my weapon, armor, items, etc… then I’d get to the next zone, and we were right back at square one “oh no… this is when I’ll need to quit, it’s too hard”. But I did slowly learn the monsters’ attack patterns through lots of trial and error.

Conclusion: Crypt of the Necrodancer is a good game. I’d recommend it to people who enjoy rhythm games… maybe more so than recommending it for people who like roguelikes. Certainly, it has roguelike stuff in it, but you really need to like the rhythm-based gameplay, if you don’t like rhythm-based gameplay the game really won’t appeal to you in the same way. However, it does have options to make the game easier too, so it can be more accessible to **** you don’t commit to getting everything, you’re looking at roughly 13-15 hours playing the game as Cadence. (More or less playtime will be required depending on how naturally good you are at the game, and how lucky you get on your runs) And if you’ve got the time and motivation to really learn the game you’re looking at hundreds of hours of play. The game is a completionist nightmare, I wouldn’t recommend doing that to yourself… but completionists already subject themselves to that agony… what’s there to lose to a little indie game, right?

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,dogukansapmz,"Crypt of the Necrodancer bir rogue-like oyun olmasına rağmen rakiplerinden oldukça sıyrılarak önümüze orjinal bir iş koymayı başarıyor. Oyunun genel yapısı her bölümün kendisine özel şarkısının ritmiyle hareket etmek. Bu oyunun direk core mekaniği çünkü rakiplerimiz de aynı ritimle hareket ediyor ve biz ritimi kaçırırsak onlar ilerleyebiliyor. Bizim ritmi kaçırdığımız durumlarda kendi saldırı hakkımızı kaybediyor bazen de durduğumuz özel bloklara göre hasar alabiliyoruz. Oyunda 15 tane oynanabilir karakter var ve bu karakterler düz skin'ler değiller de oynanabilir oyun mod'ları gibiler. Mesela birinde sadece bomba kullanabilirken bir diğerinde hiç para almadan oyunu bitirmeye çalışıyorsunuz. Oyunda 10'larca farklı mob var. Aynı zamanda 7-8 tane miniboss tipi düşman ve 5-6 tane ana boss tipi düşman var. Bu mob'ların ve miniboss'ların aynı zamanda farklı skin'li halleriyle de karşılaşıyoruz ki normalde bu durum diğer tipteki oyunlarda çok göze çarpmasına rağmen bu oyunda düşmanların bu skin değişimiyle ayrı mini mekanikler kazanması ve bir  yandan güçlenmesi oyuna çok çeşitlilik katıyor. Mesela 1 cana sahip kalkanlı iskelete 1 vuran bir silahla vurduğumuzda direk kalkanı düşerken 2 canlı kalkanlı iskelete vurduğumuzda kalkanı yerinde kalıyor , onun kalkanını düşürmek için yandan vurmamız gerekiyor. Sadece mob çeşitliliği değil aynı zamanda en dış tabakası dışında tamamiyle kırılabilir haritadan oluşan bu oyunda aynı zamanda etraftaki blokların da belirli item'larla kırılıp bazılarının kırılmaması , çeşitli tuzaklar , 6-7 tane silah tipi ve bu silah tiplerinin de 4-5 tane tarzı var. 10'larca büyü var. Bunların dışında kafana , göğsüne taktığın zırhların ve taktığın kolyeyle yüzüklerin de her birinin ayrı özelliklerinin olması tamamiyle oynanışı değiştiriyor. Özellikle oldukça cezalandırıcı bir gameplay'e sahip olduğundan item'larınızı tam potansiyeli kullanmak zorundasınız. Aynı zamanda bu sahip olduğumuz item'ları kullanmak için sadece ''q'' ya da ''g'' ye basmak gibi değil de ''aşağı ok+üste ok'' şeklinde olmasından ötürü o hızlı aksiyonun varlığından ötürü elinin ayağını dolaşması , yanlış item'ı kullanmak gibi durumlar oldukça zevkli bir oynanış ortaya tutuyor. Oyunun genel rogue-like elementlerini de güzel kullanıyor. Klasik bir şekilde run'dan kazandığımız para birimiyle kalıcı upgrade'ler , sonraki oyunda karşımıza çıkabilecek silahlar , zırhlar satın alabiliyoruz. Genel oynanış dışında arka planda bir hikaye de ilerliyor ama çok da iyi değil zaten ana odak da bu değil. Hikaye ilerledikçe yeni oynanabilir karakterler açılıyor ki bu da ana oyunun setting'inden sıkıldığında minik bir rahatlama hissi veriyor. Rogue-like oyunlardan artık sıkılsam da türün diğer örneklerinden kendini tamamen ayırmasından ötürü oynanış sürem boyunca bana oldukça güzel eşlik etti. Türün sevenine kesinlikle öneriyorum , sevmeyenine de kesinlikle denemesini istiyorum. 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢",7,True,"Feb 16, 2025"

Peglin,1637730,luberchris,"TL;DR Fun deck builder with a good challenge. No bugs.

I have high hopes for the future development of this game. It combines elements of chance through Plinko with deck-building and dungeon-crawling akin to a Slay the Spire clone, which is as refreshing as it is unique. The enemies are challenging, and the unlockable levels of the Cruciball mode add further challenges after each successful run. In addition, the option to speed up the entire game is a nice touch that helps with the grind. 

Negatives are few and far-between, outside of the normal frustration of difficulty.

Elden Ring,1245620,noleme,"I don't find this game to be much fun. Mostly just tedious. I made it maybe halfway before I decided it just wasn't for me and quit. I stopped after the underground part, after beating ancient spirit I think. This was my first fromsoft game besides sekiro which is awesome. I did like the legacy dungeons. 

The open world is a time waster. You're really just going from boss to boss. The things in between are either worthless enemies or rewards which, 9 times out of 10 are also worthless. 

That'd be ok if combat was good but I find it boring, especially coming from Sekiro. Mostly stay away from the boss or dodge roll until you get an opening. Repeat until boss is dead. Vastly inferior combat system compared to sekiro. People will just say git gud but what's git gud even mean in this game. I had a lot of trouble against an optional boss, ancient hero of zamor I think, so I left and came back much later and whooped it. I hadn't gotten any better at the game. I simply had better weapons and leveled up. So it did not feel satisfying to me. That's really the whole point of these games, the satisfaction of beating a boss, but Elden Ring just feels like a chore to me.

This game got endless praise so I've watched a lot of criticism videos hoping to find I'm not crazy for not liking the game. I think it's odd that many of these videos called it a great game or even a masterpiece with flaws. That makes no sense, a masterpiece to me means as flawless as one can reasonably expect. There seems to be a culture around this game that can't accept criticism.

I gave it 1 star because I personally disliked the game mechanics — not because it’s buggy. It’s an easy game, but frustratingly hard to play. The gameplay is clunky and takes a long time to get used to. There’s no story. No guidance. It’s artificially difficult due to the lack of information needed to play it properly. The difficulty is poorly balanced. The beginner tutorial is a complete joke. Combat mechanics feel outdated and poorly coded. The latency is awful and takes ages to adapt to. I’d estimate you need around 50 hours of practice just to handle the battle interface.

Dark Souls III,374320,LuceLuna,"До выхода Учан это был лучший представитель СЛ который в принципе и породил данный жанр. В целом игра заслуживает оценки 7, но я поставил 8 только из за того что это культовая игра, теперь о плюсах и минусах. Среди минусов причем для меня очень значимых это сюжет. Его практически нет, и тот факт, что он в данном стиле практически не раскрывается не является оправданием, что игру создали просто как слешер в своем уникальном стиле без надобности для игрока что либо объяснять. Мало текста, мало персонажей, невзрачные пару секундные концовки, всё это огромный минус, для игры которая могла нести в себе оболочку смысла и сюжета, а не быть просто отличной сложной по геймплею игрой. Второй значимый минус отсутствие желания её проходить снова. Почему? А в чём смысл, если сюжета нет и ты не откроешь для себя ничего, что мог бы пропустить в первый раз? НГ+ в этой игре становится крайне лёгким из за типичной инфляции характеристик и уже заученных боссов. Последнее. Это отвратительные модели персонажей. Без шуток, главный герой просто создан быть уродом, как бы ты не старался создать нормального(даже не красивого персонажа), у тебя вряд ли получится. Во первых модели тела ужасны, они не естественны и корявы а лица это вообще кошмар. Самый лучший вариант это надеть броню на всё тело и закрыть это безобразие. Броня это единственное что хорошо сделано в плане моделей связанных с персонажами. Теперь плюсы. Шедевральный саундтрек. Один из лучших в плане погружения и так сказать подходит именно для этой игры на 200%. Геймплей, на первом заходе сложновато, но это также зависит от типа оружия, которым ты решишь проходить. Класс очень решает. Теперь графика, в целом она устарелая, но люди которые занимались конструированием дворцов, замков, архитектуры скульптур, они реально гении.

Lies of P,1888160,SzeBBe,"If there’s even a hint of Soulslike appreciation in a player, it’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t fall in love with Lies of P. The bosses are fantastic: never unfair, always exciting, and the game gives countless ways to customize difficulty—summons, consumables, or powerful weapon options—so how tough it feels is truly up to the player's choices. It’s often called challenging, but with these tools, the real difficulty is self-imposed. Lies of P gave me that “once-in-a-lifetime” feeling I only rarely get—in many ways, it made me feel the same magic as playing Dark Souls 3 for the first time. It isn’t just a clone; it has real identity, a unique story, and NPCs whose fates I genuinely cared about. The motivation to push through tough moments and the excitement of discovery are both strong, thanks to its powerful narrative. Krat, the city you explore, is incredible—dense, atmospheric, and refreshingly straightforward. I’m grateful it isn’t another bloated open world; instead, it strikes a balance, offering side routes and hidden areas to explore, but with purposeful direction. Rarely these days can a game deliver a peak experience in a tight, focused package without unnecessary padding. The story, inspired by Pinocchio, is charmingly unique and walks a perfect line between mystery and emotion. Choices matter and deepen your investment in the journey. That said, the game isn’t flawless. In the latter stages, enemy designs are often reused, sometimes making encounters feel repetitive or dull. It can be disappointing to see an imposing boss earlier in the journey reappear later as a regular foe. Additionally, one or two of the more gimmicky bosses didn’t live up to the challenge or creativity of the rest. While narratively justified, these moments felt like missed opportunities for more engaging gameplay and broke the momentum at times. Gameplay-wise, it delivers crisp, challenging combat with phenomenal weapon variety, thanks especially to its unique blade-and-handle crafting system. Mixing and matching weapon parts kept my experience fresh, allowing for creativity and making every battle unique. For me, Lies of P is more than a game—it’s an unforgettable adventure that I’m genuinely happy I experienced. Despite these minor hiccups, I can wholeheartedly recommend Lies of P, even at full price. The journey it offers is truly worth every penny.",9,True,"Sep 21, 2025"
Lies of P,1888160,Achraf05,"The game is truly beautiful and stands as one of the best Souls-like experiences, very close to Bloodborne. The bosses are powerful and beautifully designed, and the world is exactly as it should be. There’s only one real issue: the shortcut system. At first, it was well done, but later on, the placement felt completely wrong. However, this doesn’t kill the fun at all, since the save points are perfectly distributed, making it not too bothersome. As for the story, it was good at first but became excellent with the addition.

That’s why I highly recommend it!️️
One more thing for those who say the game is extremely difficult: it’s a Souls-like, what did you expect? The game actually becomes relatively easier once you master perfect parries.

I'd describe it as a story-driven soulslike, thanks to its focus on narrative, the inclusion of multiple difficulty modes, and the fluidity of both gameplay and storytelling.Combat-wise, it holds its own against FromSoftware's best. The parry system, while challenging to master, offers incredibly satisfying feedback once you get the hang of it. It rewards precision and timing in a way that feels genuinely rewarding. The soundtrack deserves special praise—it's phenomenal. Every track complements the story and the atmospheric setting beautifully. That said, I would have liked to see more engaging and less linear level design. While the ambiance does a great job setting the tone, a more interconnected world could have added another layer of depth to **** area that could be improved is the pacing of difficulty. The game begins in a fairly approachable way, making it welcoming for newcomers, but later boss fights—despite their excellent design—feature abrupt difficulty spikes that might feel discouraging to those new to the genre.

I'd argue that the mechanics are a little too obtuse and that as a result I didn't commit to any other playstyle rather than my starting one, but the sense of being lost in an aggressive dream-like world is very strong.  The combat for me was repetitive and sluggish and the bosses aren't the best I've seen.  For me the game shines in it's 3 main 'dungeons', and the genuinely scary 'run-backs' to base camp after killing the bosses.

The game is a bit of a maze if you just wander so use the visions or you might want to look up a quick playthrough.

The biomes are great and are designed so that you don't spend too much time in them so they don't get repetitive too quickly.

Everything that isn't a boss isn't as fun to fight though. Mechanics are fun but I try to avoid using the hardening ability to make it feel less choppy.

Sertleşme muhabbeti ilginç. Kalkan gibi ama tekrar kullanmak için bir kaç saniye beklemek gerekiyor. Kabuk denilen cesetleri bulup artık o karakter olarak oynama fikri de ilginç olmuş. İstediğiniz zaman oyun stiliniz tamamen değiştirebiliyorsunuz. Ama bir ritim tutturduktan sonra her düşmanı ve hatta her boss'u aynı taktikle kesiyorsun zaten. Başta alışması zor oldu ama sonunda oynadığım en kolay soulslike oyundu.

Item'ları bir kez kullanmadan ne işe yaradığını bilemiyorsunuz. İlk kullanış genelde boşa gidiyor yani, beğenmedim. Bir de item'lıar belli bir sayıda kullanınca aşinalık kazanıp daha çok verim alıyorsunuz, iyi bir özellik.

Haritası bu kadar karmaşık bir oyun görmedim.  Bir de ana boss'ları kesip bir item alınca aynı yolu siste ve karanlıkta dönme fikri çok saçma olmuş.

Mortal Shell,1203620,Quelocura8,"He jugado a juegos malos, lentos, tediosos, que no cargaban bien los personajes, con combates aburridos y sin sentido, con parrys malos o inútiles, con escudos inservibles, juegos donde el prota es lento y torpe o donde hay muchísimo delay en las acciones, frustrantes, donde los enemigos te ven desde muy lejos y te atacan, juegos donde los enemigos que normalmente tienen poca vida, tienen más que de costumbre, juegos liosos, sin historia, sin lore, incluso juegos sin sentido, pero este se lleva la palma! A parte de todo lo anterior, no he jugado un souls más malo en mi vida, menos mal que me salió gratis. Parece sencillamente una demo (sin acabar) de un juego, los enemigos no cargan bien, el combate es monótono y aburrido, el parry no sirve de mucho, los objetos y cosas que salen en la pantallas de carga ni siquiera te sirven como consejo o para enterarte de algo, parece claramente que ni lo han testeado, tienes varias armas y no vas a pasar de la principal (la tengo al máximo y el resto todavía no puedo tenerlas ni a la mitad de nivel), las mejoras de los personajes no tienen sentido (porque no son mejoras; hay un ataque que si te conviertes en piedra en el aire haces mucho daño al caer, pero no puedes ni saltar ni caer por los sitios, ¿para que he gastado monedas y vestigios? todavía no he podido usar el ataque) y estas mejoras no se aplican bien (por ejemplo no hay otra oportunidad al matar muchísimos enemigos o no te curas al conseguir vestigios, aunque diga que aumenta la probabilidad de conseguir vestigios los enemigos no sueltan más, etc.), no he visto nada del tráiler en el juego, ni las velocidades de los personajes, ni las habilidades, ni nada de todo lo chulo que parece que promete y además de todo esto, es injusto y muy corto. Está sin pulir, con controles que en mando dejan bastante que desear, controles de cámara bastante malos, esquivas contra una pared que no sabes que está porque no ves a tu alrededor, hay muchos objetos que no son destruibles ni movibles y te entorpecen la batalla (como las tiendas) y muchísimo delay, no tiene nada de profundidad ni en el mapa ni en la historia (no sabes porqué haces nada, no tiene ningún sentido ni motivación detrás, ¿salvo el mero hecho de explorar?) ni con los enemigos (ni con nada), te lo puedes pasar prácticamente corriendo todo el rato y evitando un montón de peleas (son mejores las peleas contra boses que contra los enemigos normales, tienen más sentido). El tema de la familiaridad, que me parece algo innovador, queda totalmente opacado por el resto de cosas (lo pondría como algo ""bueno"", pero ni si quiera). Los vestigios se quedan en cada armadura (o shell) lo que genera que cuando te cambies de una a otra para mejorarlas, te lleves una desagradable sorpresa, además de obligarte a manejar una clase de personaje que igual no es tu estilo y te deja con clases/armaduras a medio mejorar. Para usar las ""habilidades"", necesitas determinación, que consigues al rellenar unas barras tipo stamina en los combates pegando enemigos.... pero si dejas de combatir y no has rellenado lo suficiente la barra, desaparece y se vacía (cosa que pasa bastante porque no quieres estar todo el rato peleando), las mejoras de las armas no puedes comprarlas, debes encontrarlas, pero tampoco sirven de mucho ya que consumen muchísima determinación (hasta el parry la consume, quitando un personaje, el resto casi no tienen barras de determinación y no es algo ampliable, encima esta es una de las cosas top que aparecen en el tráiler, pero it's a trap.) En consecuencia a todo esto, el precio base me parece una pasada y que los DLC sean de pago me parece todavía más basto. Hablando de esto último parece ser que han metido en el DLC una 5ª clase al estilo pay to win. No sé de donde habrán sacado nada para hacer el 2, pero espero que sea mucho mejor que esto. Un juego estilo souls no es un juego frustrante, desquiciante, austero o con mecánicas injustas o limitadas, son juegos que te ponen a prueba y con bastante dificultad pero te permiten mediante mecánicas a tu alcance poder probar diferente modos de combate y demás, pero este no lo hace. No sé si es que las nuevas generaciones se conforman con cualquier cosa mediocre (o con cualquier plagio, ya que intenta desesperadamente parecerse a Dark Souls), pero creo que deja bastante que desear. Como culmen de todo esto, además, tiene bugs... No se lo recomendaría ni a mi peor enemigo. Por sacarle algo bueno, los gráficos no están mal (y eso es gracias a UE4) y las canciones del laúd. No pretendo que esta crítica sea un ataque al juego, es simplemente mi experiencia con el mismo y lo que me ha transmitido (decepción). Lo probé desde la beta y ahora que han pasado varios años y lo he vuelto a probar esperando alguna mejora, me he encontrado con lo mismo que en la beta.",1,False,"Oct 28, 2025"

This is one of, if not the worst, Souls like I have played in my life.

The enemy placement is not clever, it is annoying, Dark Souls 2 SOTFS levels of annoying. The bosses are uninspired, or worse, buggy, I have been killed MULTIPLE times by lingering hitboxes after an attack has clearly, visibly and obviously stopped.

Mortal Shell,1203620,TwoBe,"###  **Mortal Shell – A Soulslike That Forgets the “Like” Part**I picked up *Mortal Shell* looking for that classic Soulslike experience — intense combat, memorable bosses, and rich, atmospheric dungeons. What I got instead was a glorified running simulator with the worst dungeon design I’ve ever seen in a video ****’s break it down: **Dungeon Design? More Like Labyrinthine Headache**I spent more time running around in circles than actually fighting enemies. The level layout is so confusing and poorly thought out that I constantly found myself ending up in the **same area I just came from**, only from a different angle — as if someone twisted a maze and forgot to label the exit. Some sections are so large and **completely empty** that I genuinely wondered if I glitched into unfinished areas. Zero enemies, zero atmosphere, just giant hallways for no reason. Whoever designed these environments seriously needs to reconsider their career.️ **Combat: The Lone Shining Light… If You Can Reach It**Boss fights were decent, I’ll give the game that. But the journey to get to them? **An absolute joke.** You’ll have to run a **marathon-length trek** through those same confusing, enemy-scarce hallways just to get back to a boss if you die. No shortcuts, no reasonable respawn points — just a big ol' middle finger to your time and patience. **Item Descriptions? Nah, Figure It Out Yourself**You want to know what an item does? Too bad! *Mortal Shell* gives you **zero info** unless you use the item first — and once you waste it, well, that's just your loss. No forgiveness, no hints, just frustration. This isn't challenge; it's **bad design** dressed up as mystery.🪖 **Shells Are Cool… Until You Try Upgrading**The Shell system — where you can possess different fallen warriors with their own strengths and weaknesses — is actually a **great idea**. It gives you flexibility and encourages experimenting with different playstyles. Unfortunately, the **skill upgrades are mostly trash**. You’ll waste precious resources unlocking garbage-tier perks that barely change anything. What’s the point of customization if it’s not worth the investment? **Final Verdict: Save Your Time, Save Your Sanity**I spent like $2 on this, and honestly, that feels like $1.50 too much. If you’re craving a Soulslike, **replay Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro**, or even other indies like *Lies of P* or *Nioh*. *Mortal Shell* is **not worth your time**, no matter how cheap it is.️ My Advice: **DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.**Save yourself the pain.

Mortal Shell,1203620,KillerBunny,"This takes every mechanic from a soulsborne, and misunderstands them completely.

Leveling: you don't. There are no stats to speak of in this regard, or rather, you start ""level evened"" with your enemies and it stays that way. You'd think this is a good thing, but it absolutely is not.  You have ""shells"" (which you have to find). It's basically a class with extra steps, and you can't develop that class outside its bounds- like giving the no-stamina tank some stamina, or the no-HP rogue some HP.  They're stuck with those stats.

You purchase sidegrades for these shells, of which only half per shell actually relate to combat in any way, and three are universal between shells. Each shell has to have their tree unlocked *individually.*  ""oh that's not so bad!"" wrong. There's only four. If your playstyle doesn't fall into one of these four ideas the devs had for you, you're S.O.L. It also means that if you DO find one that's your playstyle, and you unlock the stuff you want, the EXP resource of the game becomes completely obsolete besides buying consumables.  There is no fear of death besides having to go back to the starting area of that zone.

Parrying: Parrying isn't a normal thing. It's attached to an item you have to locate. This item needs to be charged in segments, by dealing damage. If you don't, it doesn't work.  If you don't fill the segment, it decays.  Half the enemies in the game ignore parrying anyway, because ""they hit too hard"" or -surprise- it was actually a throw attack and you were supposed to I-frame it with a dodge. This leads to healing.

Healing: Awful.  Parrying when it's charged, and consumables you have to find in the wild.  No, they are not blood vials- blood vials you have a max you can carry and they actually work. In Mortal Shell, the consumables that heal worth anything tend to remove the resource that lets you parry. Yes, you read that right.  Healing, removes your ability to both parry & by extension, heal more.  By the way, that resource is also the resource used for special moves.  So if you ever have to heal, you can't use special attacks, because those attacks cost so much of the resource, and your healing just deleted that resource.

Weapons: There's only four weapons. Three of them are big beefy two-handers your character swings like they're just waking up. The only short weapon that swings ""fast"" is dual-wielded, and only does full damage if both weapons in the attack animation hit. This dual attack swing has the same overall attack speed as the big two handers with none of the range.  In addition, all the weapons seem to do the same general damage besides the one small fast weapon, for the reason I just listed (everything has to hit). It's literally just choosing what you want your attack combo to look like, and maybe some consideration to range.  Now, how about upgrades?

To unlock your special move, you have to locate a unique item for that weapon and upgrade it at the workbench or anvil.  You also *cannot switch weapons* without going back to the hub, which you cannot do regularly because there *is no fast travel.* The other alternative is finding a specific item related to that weapon, which is an item you have to ""use.""  However, these items tend to be hidden. That's right, they made weapon switching an item usage.  By the way, that goes for shells, too.

You can't just stop and switch your class outside the hub. You have to find a *consumable* item to switch your class out in the wild (no joke, these do NOT refresh on rest).  If you want to swap out before a boss, since there's no fast travel, you have to go *all the way back to the starting hub* or burn an item.  How bout travel, then?

There's no fast travel from point to point.  There is an infinite use item to go back to the start of the zone you're in and lose your important resource, glimpses, which don't drop on death anyway.  It's literally simpler to teleport by letting enemies kill you and respawning. If you have your shell's sidegrades unlocked, which is all glimpses do, you won't even care then.

Finally, enemies.  Half the ones had throws that'll eat huge chunks of HP, can't be parried, and are long-range lunges.  Some bosses have them and they ignore parrying AND blocking.  There's an abundance of snipers that always stun when they hit you, overlooking fight zones with heavy enemies that can two shot you.  There's multiple ambushes in every zone that are completely untelegraphed, and no way to trigger them early when you DO know about them. There's no dogs, but there's worse- poisonous suicide bomber frogs.  It's actually impossible to hit them due to how the combat animations work, their size, and when they explode.  You whiff high on every attack as they approach, and angled attacks are aimed where a torso would be, but they're on the ground.  Furthermore, they're in thin tunnels, so you just have to accept getting poisoned or burn a poison immunity.

Salt and Sanctuary; Ska Studio'nun yaptığı, oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvania yapımı. 2016 çıkış yapan bu yapım cidden bu 2 türü de kendi içinde çok iyi bir şekilde birleştirmiş. Sadece iki türü birleştirmekle kalmayıp aynı zamanda iki türün özelliklerini cidden aşırı üst seviyede yaparak başarısını ortaya koyuyor.

Oyunun Türkçe dil desteğine sahip olması da ayrı şekilde güzel.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Krallıklar arasında savaşın neredeyse patlak vereceği kaotik bir dönemde , ortam biraz sakinleşsin ve barış yapılsın diye iki krallık evlilik yapmaya karar veriyor. Biz de diğer krallığa prensesi götüren ekibin bir parçasıyız. Gemiyle yolculuğumuzu yaparken gemi saldırıya uğruyor ve saldırı sırasında gemi batıyor. Bu olaylar sırasında bir şekilde bayılan biz de uyandığımızda kendimizi bir kıyıda buluyoruz. Amacımız prensesi bulmak ve her neredeysek buradan çıkmak. Temel hikaye örgüsü bu. Aslında çok güzel bir dünya yaratılmış. Şu an spoiler olacağından anlatmıyorum ama çok güzel bir lore yaratılmış.

Hikaye anlatımı souls oyunlarının çoğunda olduğu gibi çevresel anlatım şeklinde ilerliyor. Yollarda ilerlerken gördüğüm şeyler , insanların anlattıkları falan bilmediğim olayları gün yüzüne çıkarıyor ve olaylara derinlik katıyor. Tabii ki de bu anlatım hikayenin çok büyük planda olduğu yapımlar kadar iyi olmasa da , aradığımız şeyi tamamiyle verdiğini düşünmekteyim. Oyunun iki sonu var. Ama bu olay gene her Souls oyununda olduğu gibi çok minik olayları yapıp yapmadığımıza göre değişen bir yapıda. Yani yapımı değil de varlığı tatmin edici son tarzlarından.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyunun kontrolleri eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen oldukça akıcı ve genel oyun şeması kolay. Ama yeni başlayanlara çok yardımcı bir yapıda olduğunu söyleyemem. Bazı kendisine özgü mekanikleriyle Souls oyunlarından ayrılıyor ve bu durumun işimizi kolaylaştırmıyor. Oyunun genel zorluğu Souls oyunlarından biraz daha az olsa da kolay olduğu kesinlikle söylenemez. Hatta zor demek aşırıya kaçmaz.

Silah çeşitliliği oldukça fazla. Ama genel olarak belirli bir sınıfa kısıtlı kaldığımızdan ve skill tree de kullandığımız puanları yeniden düzenleme mekaniği olmadığından direk başka bir sınıfa geçme durumunuz olmuyor. Mekanikler klasik souls mekanikleri zaten. Stamina kontrolü , dodge , parry , hafif atak , ağır atak falan. Oyunda çoğu Souls oyununda olan mezhep mekaniği var. Bu mezhepler bu oyunda diğer souls oyunlarına göre çok daha önemli yer tutuyor. Çünkü direk sağladıkları kaynaklar senin oyun tarzını etkiliyor. Mesela rahip sınıf büyülerini sadece bir mezhep veriyor kalan hiçbir mezhep sana bu büyüleri sağlamıyor gibi gibi. Aynı zamanda bu mezheplerin getiridiği çok güzel bir mekanik var. Oyunda sandıklardan falan belirli totemler buluyoruz. Bulduğumuz bu totemleri bulduğumuz checkpoint'lere yerleştirerek o checkpoint'in içerisine farklı özelliklere sahip dükkan tarzı yerler açabiliyoruz ve bu totemleri koymamız aynı zamanda totem koyduğumuz bölgelerde bize ek özellikler kazandırıyor. Mesela keşif totemi bize farklı checkpoint'ler arasında fast travel imkanı sunarken aynı zamanda koyduğumuz bölgede mob'lardan düşen itemların düşme oranını arttırıyor.

Genel düşman ve boss yapay zekası oldukça kaliteli. Ama boss'ların kalitesi hakkında bunu söyleyebileceğimi sanmıyorum. Boyutu küçük boss'ların çoğu güzel fight'lar sağlarken boyutu büyük boss'ların çoğu genel mekaniksel kısıtlıklardan dolayı oldukça kolay boss'lara dönmüş. Bazı boss'lar ise zor olmasını sadece 1-2 bozuk harekete borçlu olduğundan bu konuda tam bir tutarlılık sağlanamamış. Zaten oyunda genel olarak boss'ların hasarının az olduğunu düşünüyorum. Ama aynı şekilde bazılarının belirli saldırıları var , bir kere vurduğunda kombo yapıp sana tek atabiliyor. Yani bu konuda minik sıkıntılar olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

️Grafik ve Sanat Tasarımı ️

Başta çok basit bir tasarıma sahip gibi görünse de aslında oldukça hoş bir yapısı var. Genel renk paletinin tercihinden dolayı zaten karanlık hava içimize işliyor. Çevre tasarımı da oldukça hoş. Her bölgenin birbirinden farklı yapısı oldukça belli oluyor. South Park misali karakter tasarımları insanı rahatsız edebilir cinsten ama ona da alışıyorsun. Animasyonların öyle aşırı mükemmel tarafları yok ; yeterli ve güzeller.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

Klasik mekaniklerin oyuna çok güzel entegre edilmiş olması
Mezhep mekaniği
Harita tasarımı
Düşman çeşitliliğinin fazla olması

Map'in olmaması
Bazı boss tasarımlarının basit kaçması

Oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvaniası olan Salt and Sanctuary; bu türün ilki olmasına rağmen bazen nasıl bu kadar iyi olmasıyla insanı cidden şaşırtıyor.

It has an interesting gameplay, a bit sloppy controls, OK sound design and overall has tough as nails boss fights and a over-simplistic story. Its souls-like elements feel unfinished. All of the classes - even the Rogue - feel slow to control, this feels like a huge step-down from its competitors such as Hollow Knight.

Игры серии souls изначально по сути своей были переносом жанра метроидвания на рельсы 3D, очень уникальным и своеобразным но все же. Salt and sanctuary еще раз перевернула ситуацию, она перенесла dark souls на рельсы 2D. С самого начала игра дает понять на что она опирается и вообще этого не скрывает, скорее прямо заявляет, что вот мы - фанаты dark souls и сделали игру под копирку, так как ее обожаем. Изначально я скептически отнесся, но когда влился оказалось что это нереально круто, жанр метроидвания идеально сочетается с dark souls, как атмосферой, так и боевкой. Тут присутствует почти все элементы присущие souls - ковенанты, души, множество разного оружия и брони, боссы и т.д. Ты как будто реально играешь в dark souls но в 2D. Боссы очень простые, проходятся с 1-2 раз, последнего босса убил с первого раза, но возможно я собрался как имба, играл фулл хэви билдом с двуручником и щитом. Основная проблема игра - отсутствие карты, насколько вы можете знать - в дарск соулс карты нет, но дарк соулс это не метроидвания, а тут огромный 2д мир И БЕЗ КАРТЫ! Скорее всего большинство людей сошли бы с ума из-за отсутствия карты и дропнули игру еще на середине или даже раньше, но поскольку я топографический гигант, то я выдержал, люди не готовые перманентно держать карту в голове не перенесут такого напряжения.

As for the combat itself, maybe it could be more ""complex"", but the difficulty is ramping up with few bosses. Overall it keeps the metroidvania's combat style and feel.

Salt and Sanctuary,937010,nervengas,"S&S is pretty much advertised as '2D Dark Souls', but it falls short of it's 3D inspiration on many accounts. The graphics are mediocre mid to upper flash game tier. Forget about feeling something like immersion in this game. The general theme of the background music, if present at all, alternates between repetitive and repetitive & annoying.
Weapon and armor balance is probably S&S's weakest part. Items are tiered from 1 to 5. High tier weapons are awkwardly placed and mostly useless filler - by the time you get to craft tier 3/4 stuff you can already access tier 5, making the former pointless. Lower tier weapons are simply not worth upgrading, unlike in dark souls. Lore consists of RPG boilerplate mediocrity sprinkled with the expected DS references - same for level design. It's not bad, but nothing really stands out as innovative or memorable either.
Combat.... sigh. It quickly becomes cheap and unrewarding - there is only so much you can do in this regard in a 2D engine. Total opposite to the original. There are enemies that pounce you or have some other lockdown (in some  cases instant kill) mechanic if you get close, enemies that have long range melee which you need to evade between attacks ( rinse and repeat) and various projectile attacks. The parrying system is a bit easier than in DS. High HP pools on the mob side combined with limited HP and few opportunities to attack on your side feel like something in between an attempt between a ramped up version of Dark Souls difficulty. Bosses basically require learning of patterns as well as their faster alternates which trigger once the 50% HP mark is reached, making for very drawn out fights. If that's your thing, or if you enjoy spending hours just getting through one boss pretty much every single time, this might be the one thing that will give you some enjoyment in this game. But if you think ornstein and smough or manus type fights felt least rewarding about DS, chances are you wont enjoy the boss fights in S&S because 'fast and aggressive' is the common theme here.
Blending out the copious boss fights there's actually pretty little content in the game. Excusable because there are only two devs from what I've heard but it's another thing that makes the game feel a bit too much like something that evolved from a cheap flash game hobby project. Which makes you wonder why you had to pay to play it.",3,False,"Apr 20, 2017"
Salt and Sanctuary,937010,Coldest13,"Una auténtica lástima.

Desearía que me gustara este juego, pero no va a ser posible. Salt and Sanctuary solo se ha dedicado a matarme injustamente y a robarme mis merecidas almas; pero el mayor pecado de SaS es, sin duda, el olvidar que SaS es otro juego, no un remake de Dark Souls en 2D.

Había jugado en el pasado un remake de DS para Spectrum, un pequeño juego hecho en coña parodiando el original. Ese remake para Spectrum, aún siendo una parodia hecha por un fan, aportó elementos en su jugabilidad que no se habían visto en el DS original, no muchos, pero algo nuevo metió.

Esto no lo ha hecho SaS, se ha olvidado de su propia identidad, y se ha limitado a calcarlo todo de DS, solo dejando sin copiar los elementos imposibles en un entorno 2D. Además, ha fallado al entender porqué DS funciona, lo que tampoco le ayudó a copiarlo bien.

Es una auténtica lástima, insisto, llevo siguiendo este juego durante años y lo he jugado ahora solo para llevarme un batacazo y una decepción, con todo lo que prometía.

Tal vez, no sé, los developers ahora hagan un DLC arreglando el juego básico y añadiendo más contenido, copiando lo que ocurrió con DS 2, pero algo me dice que no va a ser así, y que este juego llamado SaS que parece un prototipo, seguirá siendo un prototipo toda la eternidad.

Towards the end, I was a little disappointed with enemy variety. I think they probably needed a couple more tough later game enemies. Additionally, I was begging for one or two more unique and challenging bosses by the end. The Odur fight at the beginning is notoriously challenging, but I absolutely LOVED it.

Steelrising,1151340,korzychxp,"Please do not be discouraged by the beginning of the game, as it is only difficult and looks unimpressive at the start. The storyline is also challenging initially, but later it becomes understandable with notes, videos, conversations – it’s well done. As a long-time fan of Spiders games (still waiting for Mars War Logs 2 and Technomancer 3!), I must add my opinion. Pros:

- Great music and atmosphere (the first time I see robots with souls). 
- Fun combat, though it gets a bit tedious after side missions with recycled locations (if you play just the main story, it remains consistently good). 
- Good graphics in most locations, mainly urban and underground; the worst is the beginning of the game and the bastille when walking by the river (but I play on low settings) – the river is awful, and what’s beneath it    
- Very interesting, though serious story, definitely has potential for development (despite the robotic elements, it’s emotional, and the historical thread picks up later)
- Huge selection of weapons, fewer outfits, but it's okay    Nice protagonist, relatable, has a cool voice   
- Nice storyline characters (though I discarded La Fayette)   
- Cool feature with the vestals where you buy things 
-  Also like the new options over time, such as breaking walls or the rope for climbing higher (though there could be more of this) 
-  Quite a variety of enemies, but towards the end, you know them too well and maybe four more would be needed  
-  Worth buying the Discus Chain DLC, as it can attack from a distance and interrupts many enemy attacks

Cons:  
-  Terrible optimization, on an RX6600 I have to play on nearly minimal settings, and still, the fps can drop from 80 to 30 in many places. Luckily, I like this game enough to grit my teeth; the worst are a few options including textures, which even on high can exceed 8GB VRAM usage, not to mention ultra, and they aren’t even hyper beautiful; the game also takes quite a long time to load on HDD 
-   Lack of newer FSR (1.1 looks ugly and helps little) etc.  
-  Lack of patches for the game, as if the developers abandoned it  
-  A downside is part of the combat where the enemy can attack even if we attacked them; that is, our attacks do not interrupt the enemy's attack animation, though sometimes they do (probably a paralysis issue); the best is to play with the chain as you can hit from a distance, avoiding enemy attacks 
-   Poor character development; I played as a dancer, focused only on strength, health, and stamina, the rest seemed unnecessary (unfortunately)    
- The first location is a downside as it puts many people off the game and they return it, as it’s not as carefully made; once you get through it, it’s great  
-  Zero game balance; I’m someone who kills the monsters on hand, destroys all crates, so I collect various items and have a lot of them 

And yes. The beginning of the game is as hard as Dark Souls, but you can level up and develop your character, so you manage (I play without assists). Then the game is moderately difficult and fun. However, at the end, I play with one hand. At the end of the game, I had around level 40, weapons upgraded to level 5, over 100 healing oils, 50 grenades, lots of HP. Just any boss I encounter takes maybe 10-15 attacks, throw a few grenades at him, add a special attack, and the boss is gone. And I have so many healing tools that there’s no fear of losing life. I just play the game without major emotions, unfortunately. I play only because I like the overall setting, atmosphere, but there’s no challenge.

And I play without assists, so I don’t understand people who need assists. Really only the beginning of the game is hard (indeed too hard). But then not anymore. Then you have various special attacks, the weapon has 2 attacks, you have fire, ice, and lightning attacks. There’s really a lot of it. Therefore, the game offers many development options, equipment, various attacks, it’s overwhelming at the beginning. But later, when you know how to use it, the game becomes very easy. Really very easy. With high endurance, you also easily dodge enemy attacks and don’t get tired, which is obviously a plus for people who don’t like Dark Souls, as there you have to be 10x more careful.

I would buy the game for up to 150 PLN if only it had good optimization, FSR/DLSS updates, and if the developers didn’t abandon it.

Of course, I hope for a Steelrising 2, but seeing that the developers don’t like sequels to their games, I probably won’t get my **** I also hope the game brought some financial success. Because it’s really not bad. The beginning of the game is off-putting, the story is not understood, the game is difficult to master, and the first boss is also very hard, the optimization is terrible, but if these were improved, it would really be a solid 8/10.",9,True,"May 22, 2024"
Steelrising,1151340,Sepherim,"Steelrising es un soulslike que innova muy poco (alguna de las armas son algo originales, y puedes saltar y tienes algo más de movilidad que en otros juegos del género) pero ejecuta bien lo que se propone hacer. Para mi tiene una virtud innegable en su ambientación, ya que la Francia revolucionaria está desgraciadamente muy poco explorada en juegos o películas y es un periodo fascinante, incluso en esta versión fantástica. Caminar por las calles del París de la época, visitar palacios y lugares importantes como la Bastilla o Versalles, es genial. La historia en sí está bien pero tampoco es para tirar cohetes, pero sin duda está mejor contada que en cualquier Souls, cuenta con diálogos y decisiones que afectan al final de la historia, etc. Y el combate es ágil y fluido, con una personalización del personaje más simple que en un Souls pero que funciona decentemente bien. Gráficamente no pasará a la historia, especialmente algunas animaciones faciales flojean un poco, pero como ya dije la ambientación me fascina y está muy bien recreada, con lo que a nivel visual acaba resultando un juego distinto y bienvenido.

How these 10 out of 10 morons simply ignore this is beyond me.

Sea of Thieves,1172620,jdmsjmsrscgm,"At its heart, Sea of Thieves revolves around the thrill of exploration and the hunt for treasure. Players set sail across a beautiful, open world filled with islands, shipwrecks, and hidden coves, all packed with treasures to be found. While on these voyages, you can encounter various threats, including rival players who may be looking to steal your loot, or AI-controlled enemies like skeleton crews that provide exciting combat **** shared-world nature of Sea of Thieves adds an unpredictable element to your journeys. You never know when you might cross paths with another crew, which can lead to tense standoffs or full-blown naval battles. The freedom to play either cooperatively or competitively keeps the gameplay dynamic, as your treasure hunts may end in epic victories or heartbreaking **** of the game's most thrilling aspects is the random encounters with legendary sea monsters. You might be peacefully sailing with a hold full of treasure when suddenly the waters turn dark, and the Kraken's tentacles emerge from the deep. Or you may hear the ominous growl of the Megalodon stalking your ship.
One of the standout features of Sea of Thieves is its highly detailed and enjoyable navigation system. Steering your ship is not just a matter of pointing in the right direction and hitting “go.” Instead, it involves a range of ship management tasks: raising and lowering sails, adjusting their angle to catch the wind, managing the anchor, and even patching up holes when your ship takes **** collaborative nature of managing a ship with a crew of friends makes this experience especially fun. Each crew member has a role, from helming the ship to navigating using the map, or managing the cannons during combat. The sense of teamwork needed to successfully sail and survive in the open world is one of the game’s most satisfying elements.While Sea of Thieves nails the navigation and exploration aspects, the combat system leaves much to be desired. Whether fighting other players or AI-controlled enemies, the melee and ranged combat can feel unsatisfying and overly simplistic. The melee combat, in particular, often devolves into repetitive and ""spamy"" exchanges where players simply mash attack buttons rather than using any sort of strategy or **** some players, the experience of sailing the high seas in Sea of Thieves can come with an unfortunate side effect: motion sickness. The game’s realistic ship movement, combined with the rolling waves and constant swaying, can cause dizziness or nausea for those prone to motion sickness. Spending extended periods navigating the ocean can exacerbate this, especially during storms or rough seas, when the ship’s motion becomes even more pronounced.",8,True,"Sep 22, 2024"

Rust,252490,Nonameinmind,"Rust was released to an “early access” stage in late 2013, debuting to a peak of 22,000 players in the release month. As of now, Rust has peaked at approximately 260,000 concurrent players in January of 2025, more than ten times increase. Rusts growth has been continuous, due to the “Force Wipe,” a concept that on the first Thursday of every month they release a big update, wiping everyone's progress, across all servers. Rust is from the development studio, “Facepunch,” responsible for games such as “Garry’s Mod,” a sandbox game where anything is possible, and “Chippy,” an arcade style game based on the mechanics of “Space Invaders.” Rust is a multiplayer survival game, comparable to the likes of “Ark Survival Evolved” and “Day Z,” both of which are also set in post-apocalyptic warfare filled maps. These types of games are immensely popular due to their sadistic nature, taking others hard-earned resources for your own gain. Rust has been one of the most consistent games i have ever played, every single month they release a noticeable update to change the meta of the game. This keeps the gameplay fresh, this in addition to the server “Wipes” makes sure that players will be able to play for the whole month without it starting to feel old. However, this makes Rust extremely addicting, and very impactful on social life.  Rust is based on a post-apocalyptic island, leaving the island radioactive. It is rumoured that the island which all players first interact with was infested with the likes of a cold war, the island was used as a testing ground for weapons and personnel to do as they will. This left it in a state of warfare and an idea of “every man for himself.” Rust is a difficult game to learn, and it takes a long time to learn the mechanics, let alone to gather enough knowledge to be able to take fights, at the right time, with the right weapons and with the right amount of people. In Rust you also must learn recoil patterns along with refining your aim to insure you will hit your shots, without learning you are bound to lose every fight you take. In Rust there is not a definitive end, you can always have more resources, raid more people, take more fights. That's the beauty of Rust, you can never actually “complete” the game, this is what keeps players consistent through the month, chasing a never-ending goal. Since you never actually can complete Rust there is no “replay”, however, there is a concept of server “Wipes”, where there is a set schedule and on the day specified everyone's progress gets reset, just for them to go back and get it all again, showing the true nature of Rust. Rust’s settings are vast and varied, however you cannot modify the game farther than they let you, since its multiplier they must discourage and punish third party programs, especially ones that aim to modify the games memory. Rust is available on Steam, PlayStation Store, and Microsoft Store on XBOX, bearing in mind Rust is not cross-platform since PC players would have an advantage. Rust usually sells for £34.99; this is on console stores and on steam. Rust hovers around a 40GB size, reasonable for the large amount of content. Rust pays a large amount of attention to the graphics, the greenery and the buildings all have intricate details to make them look as realistic as possible, and they do an excellent job at it, the interiors of the “monuments” are all rustic, adding to the feel of a post-apocalyptic island. Rust has a variety of sound effects and music cues, the gun sounds are somewhat realistic, although not the best, the music is commissioned especially for rust and gives an aurora of creepy, scary survival. Rust changes the sounds depending on the environment a player is in, for example in a cave, sounds reverb and appear louder and somewhat inaccurate, while above ground there is a distinct sound for everything and a direction of where it came from is recognizable. This is unique and enhances the player experience, really helps in a survival game. Rust usually does not experience many bugs, every update is meticulously tested before being pushed to the main branch, additionally they have a “staging” branch which allows players to play updates before they are officially released, allowing for user-reported bugs to be fixed and community feedback to be taken before a new update. Rust is a multiplayer game, the game requires an online aspect to actually be enjoyable, other players are out to get your resources and you have to protect them, no matter if you’re online or offline, which introduces a sense of urgency to get back to the game and play it for even longer. In conclusion, Rust is absolutely a game to try if you have not played it already, it has a certain player base who chase the adrenaline of losing and gaining resources throughout a period, making it intense and exciting. Although, I'd be careful about the addictiveness of it, it's no joke how many hours you can pour into this game without realising.",8,True,"Oct 10, 2025"

Rust,252490,DragonulX,"Rust Huh, the game that made my childhood better since I was watching the continuity creators on YouTube back when Zombies were on the map. I ended up playing with a friend for about 140 hours, most of which hours were done on empty servers or done by one of my friends using our monthly subscription initiated servers. Initially, I would have several reasons not to recommend the game, mainly because one of those main reasons is the overpriced price. But instead, I won't do this, because from my point of view, for how many hours I invested in the game and how I didn't feel them passing by me, being the game at the same time and very fun, I suppose they deserved their money. Starting with the worst phases of the game, as long as you don't play on a server made by you, you can't really put your soul into what you created or built on the game. In the game there is the wipe term, which at the choice of the owner who owns the server, can be: weekly, every two weeks, or every month) After this deadline, the whole map returns to its initial form from the beginning without any progress. The houses, your items in the inventory and everything you have mined or collected will disappear and you will basically get it from the beginning every time. It sounds very bad since most players of Survival games grew up with Minecraft, The Forest or Don't Starve, where in these games your progress was saved for the entire period of ownership. But it's not really like that, this only applies to servers officially listed on the server page of the game, if you want to create a server you can keep it for life without giving it a mandatory wipe but it will be unlisted and not you can set it as public, if you want it public you will have to comply with this requirement. It sounds decent so far, but there is another part to come. For you to be able to maintain a server is not as easy as in other games and especially since the game does not maintain the server created by you. Either you use Wireless Lan Party programs to invite others if you have a map and want it to run on your computer, or you have to buy a server domain which is not at all cheap unlike what I was used to do until now. These would be some disadvantages in what prevents its purchase if necessary. (You can have a public server with ""No Wipe"" only if there are no servers with Survival game mode. (example: PVP)In the rest, apart from these aspects, the game is ingenious, and comes to its base with a lot of new features and monthly or bi-monthly **** updates do not in any way damage the game or its image and even revive it every time something new appears because you always have something to do in it, especially if you are just starting out with the game and especially if you have a server with Wipe. The idea is that having a server with ""No Wipe"" you cannot expand your creativity as you want on it, most of the time you end up making a construction with the walls upgraded to the maximum and then you think that you have nothing left to do being that everything you did you did during the construction of the house. That's why Wipe exists, to evolve each player individually and all starting from the same point at the time of the Wipe. Imagine Hungar Games with Unlimited Respwn (that is if you don't play on Hardcore Mode) and with several players all evolving differently and attacking each other to capture territories and get materials from the battle or loots found on Map. The idea is very good and I wonder how since its launch it has not received an award or a congratulation for this complex idea, the basis of which is the community that continues to create and maintain active servers even today after a long time. I haven't really seen any bugs or glitches, the game is decent on the optimization side and the difficulty of the AI ​​in the game is to be congratulated. I recommend the game strictly if you have many friends with whom you can have a Party or Squad for Raids because otherwise it would sometimes seem boring to you and you would want to take a break with the game more and more often until you end up losing your interest completely, so that later to return to it again being a good game. On the music side, they tried to copy different ideas from other well-known Survivor games that have good music, and somehow they came out, but not how the developers expected it to come out. All in all, it's good, but it hasn't received updates with the music packet for a long time and I'd be impatient to see that. There are many things I could talk about when it comes to this game, but many of them end up having a positive impact on the game, which makes the final conclusion I recommend it with confidence, especially if you get it at a discount like - I also bought it by the way.

Rust,252490,EricReviews,"Created by Facepunch, a group known for games such as g-mod, comes Rust. This PvP survival game pits you against both the struggles of surviving on a stranded island with no escape, but also the threat of other people and NPCs. Rust differs from other games in this genre because of its vast plethora of mechanics alongside a seemingly simple premise: survival.  Rust has a reputation for being a very challenging, unforgiving game, but I believe this simply adds to the excitement. Although it might seem that after a short while, there may be nothing new to do, but the constant fear of losing all your progress to either another player or natural causes is what makes this game stand out, as there is no safety for your hard-earned resources when offline.  This does, however, cause many players to develop severe addictions, with many members of the community gaining hour counts into the thousands.  Rust is well known for its steep learning curve, with players being judged harshly by others based on their playtime alone. The gunplay in this game also is quite difficult, making players memorize recoil patterns for many different guns, and get used to the fast time to kill. Even with the short TTK, fights involving larger groups can last hours at a time, with neither side wanting to leave the battle after putting so much time and resources in.   Many servers also introduce prizes and incentives such as bounties for the most competitive clans to compete for. This leads to the formation of very large groups, sometimes with 40+ players, working together to win money on a regular basis. The nature of the game, however, means that to keep a bounty for long enough to be cashed out, the clans have to stay active on a single server for days at a time, often leading to many sleepless nights lying in wait for an attack.  The gameplay loop can vastly vary in length with some so called ‘wipes’ lasting anywhere from a couple days to over a month. However, even though it may seem repetitive, with little variation on the gameplay, each wipe has many different encounters with new people each time, leading to an enjoyable experience for as long as you make it enjoyable.  Rust is available on both console and PC, costing upwards of £20, and can be played on either keyboard and mouse or most standard modern controllers. However, the advantages offered by keyboard and mouse leads to problems in the console community with external devices such as zens.  Graphics/Attention to Detail and Environmental interaction/Scenery/Art Direction and Style Rust has a reasonably minimalistic art style, but this doesn’t detract from the game's positives.  The sound design for the game is both immersive and reliable, with most sounds being easily distinguished between. Rust can be very difficult to run on lower end devices, and can often crash alongside excruciating loading times, but there are very few noticeable bugs, and with the game being updated regularly none stay around for too long. One of the worst and best aspects of this game are the interactions with other players. While some can be kind or funny, most are extremely hostile, and the majority of encounters involve a stream of slurs through the microphone. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend this game to younger individuals as a lot of the language and threats used are quite nerve racking for less confident people.  Overall, the game itself has many strong features, but the community does slightly let it down at times.",4,False,"Oct 9, 2024"

Jeff is the dev's favorite hero. Massive AoE healing for insane amount that also very easily deals damage to enemies at the same time for fairly high damage and can hit around walls.

Moves really fast. Has hitbox issues that have been in the game since launch that the devs for some reason refuse to fix. Always has at least 2 or 3 team-up combos.

I've provided lots of video proof of cheaters to the devs, with hard aim snap and aim lock, sometimes even doing so through walls, which is very easy to spot in a replay where you can see both team's outlines. No one on the enemy team able to see through walls or able to ping the target for the team to see, so it's insanely obvious that they are cheating, but they don't even look at the video and just claim the cheater isn't cheating.

Update: it's still absolutely terrible. Myself and literally all of my friends who used to play this game have quit because of the abysmal, unfair, toxic matchmaking. Good riddance. NetEase, sorry I won't be spending another penny on your awful game. 

Placement matches. Is it so hard to do NetEase? Guess not because 'something something something' money?  This game is already horrendously terrible enough with matchmaking with ""engagement optimized"" matchmaking where it literally puts you with/against higher tier players, but the seasonal rank resets and literally non-existent quickplay matchmaking are the icing on the cake.

It is in fact similar to other games as far as the story / lore goes, but it’s not just killing demons (although it has a lot of that too !). Planets and stars from our own solar system, such as Regulus are revered and worshipped, making this game more believable and in turn, immersing the player in the story and game.

Dota 2,570,MorfenA,"Dota 2 is not just a game; it's an experience—a challenging, sometimes infuriating, but ultimately rewarding journey. For those unfamiliar, Dota 2 is a highly complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that demands strategy, skill, and ****’s be honest: Dota 2 is hard. The steep learning curve can make it feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers. The intricacies of the game mechanics, the vast pool of heroes, and the ever-changing meta can leave even seasoned players scratching their heads. It's not uncommon to feel frustrated, to the point where you might consider breaking your keyboard or mouse after a tough **** that's also what makes Dota 2 the perfect game. The intense emotions it evokes—from the highs of pulling off an incredible play to the lows of a devastating defeat—create memories that last a lifetime. Every game is different, every match a new story.Beyond the gameplay itself, Dota 2 has a way of bringing people together. Whether you're teaming up with old friends or meeting new ones from around the world, the bonds formed through shared victories (and defeats) are strong. Many players find themselves making lasting friendships through the **** conclusion, Dota 2 is a demanding but deeply fulfilling game. It challenges you, pushes you to your limits, but also rewards you with some of the most unforgettable gaming moments. If you're willing to invest the time and effort, you'll find that Dota 2 is not just a game—it's a community, a passion, and a source of endless joy (and maybe a bit of rage too).",10,True,"Sep 5, 2025"

Dota 2,570,sakalipsa,"Throughout history, there have been numerous moments where discoveries embody the ""perfect formula"" principle, whether it's fire, the wheel, electricity, Coca-Cola... All of these discoveries or inventions are inherently part of a continuum of refinement driven by civilization's evolving needs through time and space. For example, Chess was played thousands of years ago with unlimited time per move, each piece had very different movement rules and overall rules differed significantly from modern ****, the ""perfect formula"" of Chess itself remains unchanged and will likely endure as long as our cognitive 'modus operandi' remains as it is. To put it more illustratively, these ""perfect formula"" discoveries and objects resonate with us much like corners resonate with spiders or trees and rivers resonate with beavers. Our minds are wired to engage with these perfect circuits in all their brilliance, because the human mind is a brilliant invention of evolutionary processes and this engagement is simply enjoyable wallowing in our own **** such perfect circuit, among many others in different fields, is Dota 2. This game is flawless in its **** course, you would make a logical mistake in qualitatively comparing Chess with the wheel, or fire with Coca-Cola, or electricity with Dota 2, or even Chess with Dota 2 - which is usually the case. Each of these phenomena holds its own utility field, and their disparate, incommensurable states should be considered within their own contexts and frameworks. Chess and Dota 2 may have superficial similarities, but they are fundamentally different, like ""original Cola"" VS ""DIY Fanta"" different, the only similarity might be the carbonated bubbles in both drinks, which metaphorically could resemble your mental engagement through all aspects of being tricky, witty, or cunning in strategizing and anticipating moves of your opponent in Chess, or timing your spells in Dota 2 either alone or in synergy with your... ****, yes, THE TEAM. Damn. This sounds like it's always the same team and holy f, it actually is. The game has SO MANY players and has been out there for so long that it has crystallized a distinct pattern of mentality, which could literally be captured by the term ""Team of Dota 2"" with its own hypostatized face. The community in this game deserves special attention; it is a phenomenon that needs a separate review. Actually, it deserves a psycho-pathological study. It's no joke. It's unlike anything I've encountered in any online game before and I'm not using now personal experience (or lack thereof) as a validating instrument for this opinion - it's an objective fact, especially in recent times where its collective mind has reached its peak form.Anyway, back to the game, some surrounding aspects: I've seen many people discredit it, saying things like, ""Damn, that game seems complex and time-consuming; I don't have the energy to invest in it."" Yet they proceed to play Sudoku or Chess 24/7, others invest time in watching bare-bottom TV shows, some work and provide for their families, others gamble, others read books, etc... Everyone is occupied with something, but the 'rational' fear of this game persists, as if it's a virus that will devour their life like nothing else already does. This perception is completely distorted and based on faulty assumptions. As I said, the game is perfect in its core, and that ""perfect formula"" allows you to enjoy it endlessly...HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you should sacrifice your personality, abandon your character and dreams just to immerse yourself in this sinkhole. I mean, if you're confused about your priorities and lack essential personal values, that's your own weakness and fault. It's not the game's fault if you're inclined to start compensating for that weakness with a dominance-at-all-costs attitude in the game - initially just trying to win every match, and later becoming hyper-toxic towards others. Would you blame a beer company for your careless driving while drunk, or a casino for losing enormous amounts of money?

If you are already individually dissociated and dissolved into the crystallized Dota 2 mentality, of course you would. Noob.

If you think you can just go FREE and grind for everything, you WILL SUFFER . The new player experience is realy bad. If you are interested in this game, play it for a while, and then when you get your first 75% platinum discount, make a choice.

If you are willing to BUY the starting platinum, it will carry you through the whole game, ONLY THEN you can truly enjoy the experience of progress in this game. Just go read all the other negative reviews; they are all about ""hitting the wall"" and ""repetitive grind,"" which is all caused by the platinum grind that halts your progress; without it, the game is good; with it, you have to pay for the game to be good. Also, everything for real money (not platinum) is absurdly expensive. Everything is bundled up with stuff you do not want/need, like boosters, artificially making things expensive—for example, exclusive skins for 60€, etc. So if you are not rich, you won't get those even if you are grinding for platinum in-game.

Apex has its difficulties, whilst having multiple game modes for players to play and enjoy, the game can get quite repetitive, and players can get bored or frustrated with the game over a period of time. Although the game is a multiplayer game so if you find some good friends to play with you can have endless fun. Apex is set on several mythical islands with one that is a giant ship flying high in the sky, and each island have lots of different POIs and lots of decorations such as huge creatures that look like dinosaurs and some players can even interact with and fight against to collect valuables in the game that will help the player later on in that game. The main aim of the game is to kill every other squad, trio, duo, or person and be the last remaining survivor and be pronounced the Apex champion, although to become a champion, the game has a skill-based matchmaking system, so based on your skill level of the game you will always get put against someone your skill level although sometimes it does have its faults, however there is always something new to learn such as new movement which can confuse your enemies however takes hours of practice to perfect. Apex is a battle royale based game so if you lose one match you can instantly go into a new one giving it constant replay ability and you can play until your hearts content. It is a somewhat modable game where you can access controls within the game files which allow you to set multiple movements to 1 key and set a timer for it which specifically helps in Apex as it helps players who are struggling with all the movement techniques do the with ease.                                                                                             Apex is a cross-platform game allowing players to play with friends on all sorts of game consoles, however apex is a mildly big game as it is 56g to install the base game which may cause problems for some players.                                                                                                Apex legends is a free to play game however some long-time players would argue that buying certain skins in the game would highly benefit the player, but the game is free however what comes with this is that apex can be a very aesthetically pleasing game if played on a powerful enough device and high enough graphics, otherwise the game may look extremely basic, and you may suffer performance issues.                                                                                                                          Apex has a large variety of soundtracks that each player can collect different soundtracks that add a sense of either intense music or fun exciting music, apex also has quite a stable game most of the time with few glitches but sometimes a player can get severely unlucky and run into many glitches or bugs with the game. And sometimes the server. In conclusion Apex is a fun multiplayer game with lots of different game modes for players to enjoy with a constantly changing game modes that will keep players engaged with the game.",7,True,"Oct 11, 2024"

Apex Legends,1172470,jdmsjmsrscgm,"Apex Legends is one of EA’s most notable titles, a battle royale game that continues to captivate players around the world even after several seasons. Since its launch, the game has managed to maintain an impressive relevance, not looking its age, thanks to regular updates and the introduction of new content. One of the main reasons for Apex Legends’ continued success is its competitive and accessible development. The game is structured in a way that is friendly to new players, with a gentle learning curve that allows newcomers to quickly adapt to the game’s mechanics. At the same time, the game offers enough strategic depth to keep veteran players challenged and engaged, with a constantly evolving meta and a variety of characters, each with unique abilities. EA has managed to find an effective formula to keep players engaged season after season. The introduction of new characters, game modes, seasonal events, and map updates keep the gameplay experience fresh and exciting. This constant stream of new features and improvements keeps players coming back regularly, avoiding the stagnation that can plague other games in the genre. Despite its success, it’s inevitable that some players have dropped out of the game over time. However, Apex Legends’ player base remains robust, with only a small portion of the original audience having left the game permanently. This is a testament to EA’s ability to keep the game engaging and relevant, ensuring that the majority of players continue to find reasons to stick around and explore the dynamic world of Apex Legends.",7,True,"Jun 6, 2024"

Apex Legends,1172470,LT_Gruber,"Great Battle Royale game with high tension.

When the Battle Royale genre came to market, I played a couple of them. After PUBG, which I found fun for a while, but eventually bored me, Apex Legends hit the scene and it was an amazing experience.

In Apex Legends, you start in a team (with friends or random people) and choose a character and class. Each class has its own starting layout and proficiencies and, depending on the play style, can really make the difference between winning or losing.

An epic cutscene plays in which you are dropped from a plane, and while descending, you can choose where on the map to land. On your drop, you can also see the spread out other players, so you can determine somewhat how close they are going to be. After landing, you can explore a giant map in search of new weapons, enemies and gear.

Every so often, the playable area gets smaller and running into other players will be more likely by the minute. The tension is great and with each passing second, the chance for victory or annihilation gets closer. In the end, the combat arena is not bigger than a living room in a house and the combat en tension rises to a whole new level. It is them or you.

Apex Legends looks great. The huge map, the forests, the water, character models and color pallet, it is beautiful to look at. For me, the way the game looks, really enhanced my experience and made me choose this game over other Battle Royale games in the genre.

In terms of sound, the game is also outstanding. The glorious battle music at the start, the ambient, threatening tracks when exploring the map, it is just great.

The overall atmosphere of the game feels like a whole crowd of fans and supporters is watching. It has some sort of “Super Bowl vibe” if that makes sense. Sure, players who have been eliminated can watch you struggle (or die) but most move on to another game, which makes sense. Still, Apex Legends has this appeal.

I really liked the overall setting of the game. The action, the constant alertness of your surroundings, finding cool stuff, the adrenaline rush combat when you turn around a corner and the enemy is standing there, and one time, I even won the match with my team and I felt like a God.

The game is, of course, most fun to play with friends and the coordination and teamwork is just great. You are playing a video game, but it feels like you are in the army.

My only personal problem with Battle Royale games like this, is that you find a lot of cool stuff, get one-shotted in the head, and the game is over. This has nothing to do with the game, it is just how it is played, but I always get a little bumped out over building up something cool and strong, and then lose it all in a second.

Overall, I think Apex Legends is a great game and I would recommend it to everyone.",8,True,"Jan 22, 2024"

Drop rates are insanely low and will drop gear for all classes which makes getting any upgrade for your class very hard to come by. The only way to progress is to stock pile items and switch classes when you have enough good items for the other classes because you won't be finding upgrades for the class that you are playing.

Level ups feel worthless as STR, DEX, INT no longer provide major stat improvements. Skills no longer level up. The only character they seem to have balanced the game around is the Warrior, ever other class dies so quickly it's not funny.

Performance wise the game stutters a lot and floats between 40-50 FPS with a 2080 on medium.

I'm so tired of devs labelling their game dank souls because they are too lazy to balance their game and then to top it off throwing in instant death attacks to further ruin the game.

But I do feel that I have to mention that first, due to the image the game has and how much that oversimplification has harmed the game's reputation.

This game honestly feels infinitely more balanced than OW foundationally. OW forces you to play certain team comps, on certain maps, with each character usually having a single viable playstyle with little room to budge. Paladins offers tons of playstyles for each character through options like talents, in-game store abilities (think MOBAs, not actual cash stores), and even a loadout system using deckbuilding to sway your characters skills to your playstyle, optimizing exactly how you play.

Overwatch is such a frustrating experience because of how thin its meta is and how you're forced into certain playstyles and comps. If you don't follow them, you're going to get steamrolled. If you play support or tank and don't have reliable teammates, you're going to get steamrolled since you can't manage enough to defend yourself. Paladins gives you the option to play your role and hold your own when you need.

This game is not an Overwatch clone, it is better. You have options, you're not limited in how you can play characters, and while you probably aren't going to win without solid teamwork, you can at least have more freedom to sway the game in your direction and keep yourself alive by fighting back.

Overwatch right now is in it's best shape since 2017, the roster is balanced, little bugs, matchmaking in Comp is nice and the best one is that Blizzard cares for it very much, they listen to the player's feedback, they always try their best with balancing now and try to not make power creeps like before, although the anti cheat system is a bit crap.

playing this game on its fullest requires roughly an ammount of 180 euros if you want the full fleshed out experience, in a place where doing endgame activities requires a group of people (3 in total for dungeons, 6 for raids), thats rather hard to find in a community that on one side calls the experts elitists with massive egos and one the other views helping new players out a rather big waste of time.
Is destiny 2 worth playing? yes (on pc expecially) despite the downsides a new player has a lot to work with, improving, finding a team/clan and testing themselves on normal and hard versions of interesting raids and (for the more masochist) testing themselves in trials on a pvp ruled by meta ability spam of certain characters, exotics and damn smgs with qa rather **** balancing. (it aint worth it trust me). On a run for normal and adept loot with specific rolls.

La razón principal es que es imposible ponerse al día, no solo por la parte mecánica (he metido muchas horas a Warframe, entiendo que para que un jugador nuevo entre a un juego así y se ponga al día va a necesitar invertir tiempo) sino porque han quitado tanto contenido que literalmente es imposible que nos importe lo que está pasando. Un ejemplo, nos dicen que Cayde-6 está muerto y todo el mundo está tremendamente triste, y entiendo que sea un personaje importante del 1 y el 2, pero como han quitado todo su contenido del juego lo único que podemos hacer es jugar la misión en la que se muere, que falla en tener ningún impacto emocional porque no conocemos al personaje. Y así con todo. Sabía que el vault existía, pero pensaba que habían metido en él cosas laterales, sidequests y demás, pero como han metido campañas enteras, lo que encuentras es un desastre a nivel narrativo que es muy difícil seguir, saber en qué orden hacer, etc. Una de las peores experiencias que he tenido como jugador nuevo en un juego.Y eso que, la parte de combate, las clases, las habilidades, las armas y demás, todo eso es divertido. Bueno, menos las secciones de plataformeo, que son un coñazo ortopédico y parece que les gustan mucho. Pero todo lo demás realmente es muy bueno, y los trozos que te dejan ver de la historia parece un mundo interesante, con buen worldbuilding e ideas chulas.

Con lo cual a nivel técnico cumple muy **** una lástima que sea este desastre injugable el resultado final, realmente me estaba gustando y estaba bastante decidido a comprarme las expansiones y eso hasta descubrir que en realidad aún con ellas me iba a perder multitud de contenido, historia y demás.

Destiny 2,1085660,ztokdo,"Despite a rough launch that led to a divebomb of negative reviews just about that, there's plenty of other things that really make you hate it.  
THE FINAL SHAPE LACKS REAL CHARACTER.   The villain is just annoying to see or even hear any wierd ramblings from.  The amazingly beautiful visuals and gunplay are so contrasting to story and overpowered ability spam.   The final shape is a mediocre offbeat soap opera.  The final shape is lucky that no other game is trying a first person live service looter shooter.    

Honestly Zavala, Ikora, and ghost are relatively annoying.  Did you realize that the story mentions some great apocalypse, then the FINAL SHAPE FEELS NOTHING LIKE THAT.  The missions are tedious and have several ""gotcha"" moments.  A lot of time I feel like I'm just waiting for some dialogue or something to just play out.

The best parts of Destiny's past have been the speaker, Cayde, Savathûn, and Ghaul.  All of the world and feeling of complete power that Savathûn had in the Witch Queen is just gone since then.

The ""end game"" still boils down to making the same dozen exotics work.  The grind to get perfect gear and eggballs is aweful. The most recent ""events"" are all based on FOMO and are horrible to play.   I hardly know anyone who could put in the hundreds of hours to complete the 25 lost sectors or 50 runs of onslaught.  The dev team has completely lost touch with their player base.  

Who wants 2 hour long actitives like the recent raid.  It's great for streamers and aweful for friendship.  People get bored repeating fights in a room with wave after wave of stuff spawning in.  The main way to die is to not memorize where things spawn in for their gotcha kills.  

It's going to be the same thing as usual.  Bungie literally gives Destiny expansions and all current FOMO items to all their streamers to keep them streaming it.  This is public knowledge.  In contrast, I keep running into people with 30-100 clears of dungeons and raids without the exotics or main loot.   It's absolutely repetitive to the point that you hate it and has only double downed on that.

If you feel like it's worth a playthrough of the story and not getting the main items of value that it's probably worth getting it for you.  If you are lonely and have nothing going on in life, it's a great opportunity to stay that way and that may be for you.   The final shape really didn't capture a gaming experience and is really hoping that you buy it for nostalgia of what once was a game.",4,False,"Jun 11, 2024"

Destiny 2,1085660,LT_Gruber,"Absolutely not the game for me personally.

I did not like Destiny 2. Although my reasons are entirely personal, I just could not get into it. I never liked service model games to start with, and Destiny 2 is no exception.

From the start, I could not care less about the main story of the game. There is a whole universe of lore, story, events, memorable characters etc., but for some reason, I could not give a flying ****. I created my character, finished the tutorial and already felt pointless and bored. Normally I would “educate” the reader of my reviews with a quick recap of the story or main goal, but in this case, I just cared too less.

I played some missions and quests but nothing felt like it mattered. I go to the location, kill stuff, complete the mission, earn my rewards and felt hollow inside afterwards. The thought of repeating this process until I grew to a certain level pained me, and when reaching level ten or so, I was done.

Graphicly, I think Destiny 2 is boring. It is blend, stale and flat. The worst environment with these graphics is the Central Hub location. Weapons and animations look well and polished enough, but the color pallet is just boring.

Sound wise, I think this is one of the worst I have played. Sound effects and music is so generic and dull, and distant enemies do almost not make any sound or grunts at all.

The controls and menus were horrendous and really hard to figure out and understand for me, and the sleek, SQL database design of it did not appeal to me.

Loot was absolutely pointless in my opinion. You get the same weapon or armor twenty million times, but with a different rarity or color. The stats meant nothing to me and I had no freaking clue wat was good and wat was bad. The numbers showed me that an item was way better than the previous one, but when equipping it, I did not notice any difference.

Destiny 2 has a certain “theme/skin/feel” that is the same as games like Anthem or Starfield (in hindsight). It is hard to explain, but revolves about the look of the inventory screens, stat screens, quest markers, etc. It is purely based on the menus and inventory management. For me, that was a problem, because Anthem was one of the worst games I ever played in terms of boredom.

The feeling of a freemium game in which you complete generic missions over and over and over again is just not for me. I constantly got the feeling that I could achieve nothing, unless I pulled out my wallet, although this is technically not the case.

Because the game is “Freemium”, you constantly get confronted with “deals”, “special offers”, “new store items”, and “best values” from the in game store. In the menu’s, at the start screen, at every interactable screen, it just felt like playing a online webstore in a browser. I understand it, because of its model, but I just don’t like microtransactions in games in general and, in hindsight, it is just better for me not to play this kind of games at all.

In conclusion, my own personal experience with Destiny 2 was very miserable. I hated every second of it and was bored out of my mind the second I even started the tutorial.

I personally would not recommend this game.",0,False,"Jan 11, 2024"

SQUAD LEADER is the most important, as you are on the front, in the trenches with your men, capturing points and painting targets for the Commander...while under fire. Also responsible for digging tunnels for spawning purposes. Without the SQUAD LEADERS, the Commanders have no drops. In my opinion, this is one of the hottest shooters to date.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,garethvk,"The trend in war based shooters of late is to literally take a blast from the past. Battlefield 1 looked at WW1 and Call of Duty returned to its WWII roots for the most recent game in the series. As such when Rising Storm 2: Vietnam was announced, it seemed like a good progression and one that holds a lot of potential for gamers. The previous game in the series focused on the Pacific Rim conflicts and focused on the conflict with Japan.
This time out the focus is Vietnam and players can opt to fight for either the Vietnamese or U.S. forces and they will also be able to select a class and loadout unique to each side before entering the fray.
The matches I took part in showed off the large and detailed maps which provided plenty of options to flank and enemy or attack from cover. Fields, towns, temples, and more were all an option and I had intense battles in a multi-level building, trenches, fields, and in a town. The weapons were varied but I opted mainly for an M-16 or AK-47 depending on which side I was assigned to. I did have a great opportunity early in the match to ride on a Helicopter and took my position manning one of the machine guns, which allowed us to strafe enemy targets as we traveled.
Our focus was a mix of taking and securing an objective and of course eliminating as many enemies as I could. Using a mix of grenades and rifle shots I was able to dispatch a few enemies but you could tell that there were some seasoned players online who used to the map to their advantage and were masters at striking without being seen.
I also experienced some people who were more than happy to call in a Napalm strike without any concern to the number of friendly troops in the target area. Naturally as you progress you will rank up and have more options for your character and loadouts.
The graphics of the game were solid but did seem a bit dated compared to other shooters. But this does a great job of giving a rough and battle-worn look to the game and not trying to make a blasted and remote area looked like an over-polished presentation.
If you are a fan of team-based online shooters and want some great action in the Vietnam setting; then Rising Storm 2: Vietnam just might be the game for you.

Prodeus,1200570,kwstas2,"Prodeus is an old school classic FPS which takes inspiration from both the Doom and Quake series. It is a pretty good game and a satisfying shooter though is not perfect by a long shot in my opinion. What is best about it is the shooting and the sound design especially when it comes to gunfire sound effects. The level design through a decent amount of missions it provides is almost superb at its best to almost quite **** at its worst. The guns are pretty amazing overall and they are extremely fun to use with some being even better than others. Visually is alright even with the retro thingy that is going for but still I wouldn't exactly say it's anything spectacular. what keeps it down for the most part in my eyes it's a lack of viriety in general whether it's the enemies, the environments, the textures etc. there is not much of any of that really. What annoyed me personally is the respawn system after death which is something similar to bioshock, I could explain why but I will just say that it just doesn't work for me. And the final thing which is not exactly a problem but maybe is worth mentioning is that the game is pretty short, it can get 10 hours give or take to do most things in the game.",7,True,"Apr 11, 2024"
Prodeus,1200570,Nmaa18,"Short review: I have three main issues. I noticed after 10 hours of playing that I had never died from an enemy, the difficulty is in finding the ores and the exploration/platforming more than the enemies themselves unlike in Doom where both are difficult. Secondly, I find that finding these ores is incredibly difficult, to the point where I often need to look online for their locations. Even getting the map doesn't help much, as it lacks clarity and is convoluted. The issue is that the store is an integral part of the game, and not getting ores holds you back gameplay-wise. Finally its a little bit repetitive, but I guess this is an inherent/vestigial trait of this sort of old school FPS-style game. Nevertheless, the game is still fun, and the sound design, style, and sfx are great and helps set Prodeus apart from the rest. Shooting feels great too. Finally I like the amount of content there is, and the community maps is a great feature that adds a creative aspect and more replay-ability.

Enemies and the environment are highlighted with red accents on a white background. This design choice enhances the player's focus and strategic thinking.Gameplay:The game allows players to progress through challenging levels filled with formidable enemies. However, thanks to the time-slowing mechanic, players can carefully plan each move and foresee dangerous situations.

SUPERHOT,322500,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) Después de completar la campaña de SuperHot, puedo afirmar que no esperaba encontrarme con un videojuego tan bueno. Un juego simple pero complejo al mismo tiempo. Un juego que me ha sorprendido narrativamente. Un juego que tiene mucho contenido al terminarlo. Un shooter único en su especie vaya. Voy a empezar hablando del gameplay.SuperHot es un shooter que cuando no nos movemos, el tiempo transcurre muchísimo más lento (casi se para), permitiéndonos hacer auténticas virguerías con los enemigos (unos personajes rojos). Ya está. No tiene muchísimas mecánicas, no te atosiga con armas. No. Tú te inventas la forma de pasar los niveles. La cantidad de interacciones es única y es una gozada ver la repetición de un nivel en el que has hecho alguna fantasmada. Aunque el tiempo se pare bastante, se siente muy frenético y nos da una sensación de adrenalina muy **** variedad de armas que hay me ha sorprendido. Tanto que puedes usar hasta objetos del entorno (cosa que se hace muy divertida de ver) para lanzárselos a los enemigos. La mecánica que más me ha gustado ha sido la del HotSwitch. Consiste en que podemos cambiarnos el cuerpo con enemigos para transformarnos en ellos. Parece raro, pero a la hora de la verdad resulta increíble usarla. Ahora bien, esto se usa a partir de la segunda mitad, por lo que me parece que no se aprovecha todo lo que podría, pero el tiempo que se aprovecha, es un 10.Audiovisualmente, me ha gustado. Es un juego muy simple en este apartado, pero ser simple lo hace tan bien que acaba siendo muy bonito. Un estilo artístico muy limpio y unos sonidos muy buenos hacen de este juego una sorpresa en este aspecto.Y la historia me ha encantado. No porque tenga un guión elaboradísimo, sino por las sorpresas que da por el camino. La manera en la que la enfocan y cómo se va torciendo el juego me han fascinado, a parte de que tiene un transcurso muy natural y poco forzado. Aviso que os va a encantar.Resumiendo, SuperHot me ha gustado muchísimo. Es un juego único que creo que todos deberían darle una oportunidad al menos, porque no dejará indiferente a nadie. Un shooter como ninguno en una experiencia como ninguna. Recomendadísimo",8,True,"Jan 1, 2024"

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,Flemat,"Solid mechanics, nice art style and card balance is fairly ok. Without the 1 major cons it would be a 8/10.
HOWEVER
the 20 hp that the players have is JUST NOT ENOUGH in my opinion. Why make expensive, decks (why buy or grind), when you can just go ""Noxus"" / ""anything else"" but i recommend ""Ionia"" to just go ""face aka. Nexus, and win in sometimes 3, usually 4-6, and at most 8 turns!? Ofc. you can go meta Heimerdinger/Vi or something similar, but again...WHATS THE POINT?!

Because of this kinda game breaking thing (easy to fix, yet still isn't: Nexus hp 20 -> 30) its VERY CHEESE, very EASY to dominate casual players and to grind up EVERYTHING in 2 weeks (inc. Bildgewater). So yea after 2 weeks i'm left with: ok, what now? NOTHING really. So w8 for next big updates / uninstall, that's it.

PS: If you play anything else, it will take you MONTHS to get everything. Some of my friends stopped playing it all together after 2 weeks because ""its too grindy"" / ""too slow to progress"". When I told them and showed them my method, they were like "" F OFF!!!"". Some came back and finished their grind in a few days, some swore to never touch this game again EVER!

In either case, you MIGHT have a solid 2 weeks of fun (by that i mean Strategically and tactically go ONLY Face/Nexus like a totally skilled player. Units live or die? Doesn't matter! Amount of cards in hand and/or deck? Doesn't matter! Mana cost/efficiency? Doesn't matter, only playing with cheap BS units and everything comes on curve 97.50% of the time! Leveling up Hero units? Doesnt matter, if it lives or dies! Strategy, positioning, synergy, tactics? DOESN'T F-ING MATTER!!! FACE FACE FAAAAACE like a total moron. Aaand it actually WORKS XD). Would usually rank it higher for that fact alone, that I had 2 weeks worth of fun, but we are talking about a company that has a lil. bit of che ching ($$$), so nope. League of Legends wanst made to last 2 weeks. I mean COME ON someone rewrite the 2 to a 3 (20 -> 30), if its mixed up! is it THAT HARD? Yes it is :)

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,NDiggy13,"Another pay to win card game in the same vein as Hearthstone and Gwent.  If you like Hearthstone but would rather play a card game set in the League of Legends universe then this game is worth checking out.  Be forewarned though, just as with Hearthstone, you'll either have to spend a lot of money up front or spend a copious amount of time playing the game over the coming months to be able to build a competitive deck.  Matchmaking is abysmal and deck balance doesn't exist.

The game seems generous at first with rewards, but you quickly learn that the rewards aren't the powerful cards you really need to compete.  And if you decide you do want to spend money, then I hope you have plenty of cash to burn because it will cost quite a bit to build a competitive deck or two with how the shop is structured.

Card balance and mana costs need a lot of tuning, which is surprising since I would have assumed they would have gotten this more balanced before going live.  Some champions are absolutely broken, Tryndemere springs to mind.  He's insanely powerful and once he's on the field it's a guaranteed win.  Doesn't require any set up or intricate card combinations to pull off, just play him and you win 95% of the time.   That's not well balanced, and that's just one example.

Stay away from this game unless you plan on spending a lot of money, or don't plan on having a competitive deck for several months, because it will take at least that long to build with the reward system currently in place.

Sea of Stars,1449850,Hackattaque,"Like Chained Echoes, Sea of Stars is a beautifully crafted throwback to the 90s RPG era, complete with all the quality of life improvements that we’d expect in the 2020s. No more random battles, painful level grinding and scattered save points; and as for the old-school ways of turn-based combat, it’s been given some clever twists, including a puzzle-lock system that gives you a chance to stop your opponent’s attack with the right spells.

Where Chained Echoes goes for a very elaborate and epic story full of plot twists, though, Sea of Stars goes for a more intimate and cozy tale of friendship and loyalty between three childhood friends who have a clear enemy to defeat. And whereas Chained Echoes had some fairly sprawling level environments, Sea of Stars has a more compact approach to dungeons, with tight puzzles to solve and pretty varied themes.

I would say overall I preferred Sea of Stars for its moment-to-moment gameplay and Chained Echoes for its story.

Crusader Kings III,1158310,matis9323,A great game in its genre. The RPG style adds a lot to it! Paradox really made one of their best game with that opus.,8,True,"Mar 30, 2025"
Crusader Kings III,1158310,PWC_ee,"Having found myself stuck deep in 1000+ hours with this game, I believed I could say that it is a great game.  

Overall, this game isn't just about warfare; it has within it intrigues, strategies, and some unpredictable plot twists just like in real life! You wouldn't be surprised to find out about why medieval people love to marry their kin and offspring off to some powerful duke or king. Even though it is sufficient enough to play it with the base game, I highly recommend the extension like ""Roads to Power"" and ""Tours and Tournaments,"" as it would add more varieties and more engaging content to the game.  

The game mechanic is quite good with a great UI; you can play as historical characters such as Kaiser Heinrich V of the HRE or King William the Conqueror (Duke of Normandy) or even the Mongols Borijin dynasty, and if you're up for something new, you can create your own character and rule the land you choose!  

For the mechanics, first let's begin with cultures. Cultures, of course, determine what we are like; If we are Mongols, then we are good at riding horses, and you can challenge your ruler for the throne or vice versa. While some cultures are more advanced, each culture shows different strengths and weaknesses. Next, the religions: there are also many religions unknown to me in this game, so I'd like to mainly talk about Christianity and what's unique about it; The pope will likely declare a crusade around 12th century, and you can either pledge to support it financially or militarily or both; the worst case scenario would be not to support it, as you'll lose piety and prestige. While participating could lead to a gain in prowess, prestige, and gold, you may have to take the risk of losing your knights or heirs in the battle. You can also create your own religion if you'd like to.  

Now, it's the characters time. So, if you choose some of the historical characters within the recommendation, then you will surely have a great stated character. The stats of a character comprise of prestige, diplomacy, intrigue, learning, stewardship, martial, and prowess: I guess the names already give hints of what they do. The higher the stat, the better your character will be at each task; high diplomacy means you can soothe other rulers and may be easier to make friends with them, etc. There is also an education mechanic where you can raise your child to have a certain personality upon their growth period (0-16 years). Choosing guardian can be a hard task, as you must choose according to the baby's traits such as the ""Charming"" should be studying diplomacy, and the guardian should have a great number of diplomacy stats, etc.  

To conclude, I do urge you to try this game out. It's got everything you'd expect. As an Asian, I don't think you should buy it full price, as lately, this game has been out on lots of discounts, so I do highly recommend you wait until the next promotional period.  

The rating would be 8.5/10.",9,True,"Mar 7, 2025"

Divinity Original Sin,230230,bskierys,"6/10 + 1 because of the perfectly executed couch coop.
Short: The game with great combat system, but generic setting and the plot that you don't really care about. I loved levelling up, and hated music and visual style.
Longer: What ""Divinity: Original Sin"" does very well is the combat system. Levelling up is slow and you rarely gain any new skill - and this was a great decision. After a while you perfectly understand every action you may take, its pros and cons. I played the whole game with my wife in a couch coop way and it was a great way to experience this game.
However, I was expecting more from an RPG when it comes to plot and atmosphere. When playing it, I felt like I was playing a hack&slash game with turn-based combat. The atmosphere is dull, generic and the dialogs are poorly written. We either skipped through them or was bored by them. The silly tone both in visuals and in dialogues was more annoying than entertaining.
We also hated the music that was so much anti-climatic. Especially that you have to listen to it over and over again during many many fights.
The quests were designed in clever way, presenting many ways of solving them, using the game elemental interactions. But beware the riddles. I usually love riddles in the games, but most of them in this game, are based on finding a correct object that you don't know that you are looking for.
Overall, it is a good game, but based on reviews I was expecting more. I was constantly comparing it to Pillars of Eternity, which I liked much more. If you want a good gameplay mechanics I encourage you to play ""Divinity: Original Sin"". But if you are looking for a good RPG, keep away from it.",7,True,"Jan 12, 2020"

Divinity Original Sin,230230,NightGeisha,"One of the advantages of wait to buy this game is that now (2019) when bought it, I get two different experiences. I get the classic version and a enchanted version.
It may not seem significant, but it is. They are two distinct experiences of the same fantastic game.

I have not finished the game yet, because it is an immense and challenging game, but honestly I think I will not going to finish it for now, at least on this classic version of the game. Little more than 20 hours of playtrough in the classic version I think I have a good feeling of what the classic version have to offer and going to do the same with the enchanted...

But back to the game, it is simply incredible. Visually, mechanically. A pure role playing game experience, where the roots of the genre were transposed to the maximum.
Fighting for me is the most interesting and challenging element and it is necessary to use the head and the elements that surround us against the enemy.

It is a game of elements where fire, earth, water and air annihilate each other in a perfect circle. Its a game where an ""area of effect spell"" reaches not only the enemy but the ally in that area. And it's so perfectly done every single way, every moment on every fight.

Those small details are also huge and make this game unique. For me it is a masterpiece of the genre, that I strongly recommend.",9,True,"Jan 2, 2019"

Divinity Original Sin,230230,MeritCoba,"Captain Jack dropped us off at a beach instead off at the harbor of Cyseal as the town was besieged by orcs, mostly from the sea. The town, with its sizable harbor, apparently lacked a navy of sorts, which left it at the mercy of the orcish incursions. Well, not quite, for it did have an army called the legion, which would also have failed to defeat the orcs if it hadn't been for some magical crossbows the local hedge wizard had put together.

We didn't really mind to disembark as Jack seemed a bit too much like a pirate with his eyepatch, wooden leg and speech spiced with harrs and yarrs. In fact we were certain he was one as he knew the situation in Cyseal all too well.Since pirates prey on local shipping by hiding out in coastal waters, it stands to reason that they are perfectly aware of the comings and goings of ships and people in that harbor and the associated opportunities and dangers. Anyway, he was crash enough to tell us about the plight of the town only when we were about to reach it and proposed ditching us on a beach as if he was offering us a way out. We suspected that the only other option would have been walking the plank.

We were source hunters. Source was a thing that sourcerers used to power whatever needs powering. Actually we forgot the last part as we were stuck thinking about sourcerers/sorcerers thing. Somewhere a guy behind a screen in a universe far away thought this brilliant or hilarious and he was even able to convince some other guys in other rooms of that fact. It is indie and therefore it is excusable we were informed.

Somewhat further inland we ran into a dead guy. The note on his corpse informed us that some statues convinced him that he could fly. Apparently he took some time to write this down, either before or during his leap of faith. We suspected foul play as it was far more likely that he was killed and then the perpetrator took time to cover this up by planting this note on him.  It is that level of (N)CIS writing we are talking about. We found out later that nothing of the sort happened; he actually did write the note(!).  But at that point we actually didn't really care one way or another as we were not the law in those parts, in fact we soon found out.. nobody was.

After an encounter with a poetic shell(the only highlight) and some undead summoned by some guy which we dealt with by summoning stuff of our own, we encountered two drunk soldiers, then ran into a group of orcs headed by a mysterious man, which would have made mincemeat of us if  three sober soldiers had not taken care of them for us.

Finally we reached the town Cyseal which was noteworthy because of three things. The first were the dozens, nay hundreds, of barrels, chests, caskets, baskets filled with random content running from nothing to incredible powerful, if you happen to require stats improvements for two stats that are diametrically opposed. The second thing were quests that started someplace, continued at another place, without being clear how to go for one place to the other, and then earned you a trifle experience if you finished them. The last was that exiting the town on the other side too soon resulted in instant death as you need at least one or two levels and be equipped with some good stuff to beat even the three undead lurking on the outskirts. And once we did have that we found out that our gear deteriorated at such a rapid pace that we had to repair our gear every second battle.

Furthermore we ran into an imp called ZixZax who was the historian of all events in time, which was really funny, if we had been eight perhaps, a morai who had migrated out of the Greek legends(or a norn out of the Norse mythology) and dozens of more stuff stolen from history, mythology and stories that hailmark this game as superior uninspired as it comes to storytelling, which would not even be so bad if it just had added something original to it, like a twist instead of a silly play of words.
At this point we gave up and went to read a book or watch a movie or redo tombraider.

Original Sin is a LRPG. A looting role play game which is the wet dream for anyone who wants a nickname that spells micromanagement. You get to loot and loot some more and do that save-before-opening-the-random-chest-and-reload-if-it-doesn't-give-you-anything-worthwhile thing. The loot only marginally improves you scores as does the leveling. The whole thing is aimed at having you spend most of you time on deciding things like: should I use this dexterity +1 and strength +1 / + 10 % poison resistant sword or this speed +1 and intelligence +1 club with double durability? Only to find out  weapons either break two battles later or have become worthless after you progress one or two levels. But if you do not micromanage: prepare to die. A lot.

Apparently.. this is what what the people who kickstarted this game wanted.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,EpicCalibur,"Tried game for one hour. The combat is insipid, slow, and thoughtless. Combat is turn based. If this game played like Dungeon Siege, it would have been awesome, but, it does not. The good graphics does not save this game. As a hero, you feel pretty weak and the characters are fragile compared to the enemies. The combat is painfully slow, it takes 10-15 minutes to fight 3 -6 skeletons! Your spells and abilities seem only to pinch the enemies and the enemies heal 2 turns worth of your attacks in one turn. The enemies are also very spread out so you are walking around a lot with nothing to look at except the map. This game absolutely is a chore to play, and is not fun.

But I did watch gameplay of this game and it interested me as I could create and play as my own **** world is so amazing, unique, wondrous and creative. Interesting to explore at **** Castle is the most interesting to explore. Everywhere else seems like a repetitive boring after thought and wasn't necessary and would of preferred if they put more focus and effort into making NPC's more interesting in dialogue, interactions and choices.Combat is done well even though it lacks enemy **** story is sort of ok.I do like exploring and trying to solve and complete things, but the puzzles and objectives are a bit too repetitive and rather dull. And there is too much of going back and forth as everything is gated behind skills that you get gradually. It took a long time trying to find all 95 Merlin trials and complete all challenges. I got all Revelio pages but it's so boring trying to find and complete the collection, so don't think I'll bother as it feels like a torturous waste of time.I don't like how you can only sell gear, you can't sell potions or materials. Even when you get your own shop. But even so I had so much money left even after buying all seeds, potion recipes and all the items you could for your room.Beast breeding is a bit disappointing the offspring doesn't grow up. All you can do is sell them to the beast shop. So no breeding different mounts or anything fun like that.I feel the game needs much better content. The conversations and narrative are boring, bland and weak. The game encourages you to converse with the professors  but what they say isn't interesting at all. I didn't find the characters interesting at all either. And it feels like the professors talk to you like you are a moron. It seems like this games speech is more catered towards young children than adults. It doesn't feel like a good open world game. It's an alright game. The game play doesn't feel very meaningful. I only kept playing as I am a bit OC about trying to complete a game and I will keep playing an alright game as long as I don't absolutely hate it.I didn't have any technical issues and only minor stuttering in some areas besides the  over bright lighting in treasure vaults making it impossible to see during the day which is an issue caused by a previous patch. This game is a bit too simplistic and seems it's made more for children.I like the castle, Hogwarts is enthralling and it's creatures. Riding around on a broom is fun and love when you finally get a beautiful hippogriff. Summoner's court was fun and it would of be nice if we could play it as much as we like.

Octopath Traveler II,1096530,Tiwill,"Octopath Traveler II tells us that we don't need to be a superstar in order to bring hope to people. If you can make even just one person smile, you've accomplished something incredible and they will be a ray of happiness to you in return.

It conveys the idea that anyone can lose their way if they let their own pain taint their actions, and that it can be difficult to get out of that state of mind without a helping hand. Being patient with such a person in a time of need may blossom into a lifelong bond. Saving someone from their inner turmoils and giving them a chance to get back on their feet is a worthwhile endeavor.

It urges us to seek our own path, for we can never be truly free when adhering to someone else's expectations unwillingly. Sometimes, if your words fall on deaf ears, the only option left is to remove that person from your life.

It encourages us to be good to people, with no ulterior motive, and not to be insecure when challenged by misguided individuals who perform irrefutably malevolent deeds. If you let yourself be swayed by someone who acts with hatred, resentment or jealousy in their heart, you can quickly become just as lost as they are. It also reminds of the importance of patient critical thinking over immediate emotional response.

It even manages to tackle the topic of technological advancement and the need for wealth redistribution as new things get invented that improve the efficiency of production. After all, if knowledge exists to be shared with all, dough shouldn't just be hoarded either.

It is a tale about enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and spreading warmth and happiness around us.

~ ~ ~

This game is more than everything I had hoped for in a sequel to the first game. Much of the praise I had for that game also applies here, so I won't repeat all of the things Octopath Traveler II took from the first game that didn't need to be fixed, but let's dive into the ways in which it improves upon the original.

Improvements to the skills make it so there are much more ways to break enemies, and classes have been rebalanced in a way that feels like they all complement each other even better than before. The new Latent Power and EX Skills also make each character have a stronger identity in combat, and there is now a way to equip the same sub-class onto more than one character if you want to.

This series continues to have best-in-class music. As catchy as it is epic, as comforting as it is melancholic. Most of it is new, but a couple of melodies from the first game made a return in remixed fashion, striking a chord of nostalgia within me while strengthening the continuity of the series. It gave me the sentiment that these eight new travelers were experiencing emotions that the characters from the first game had also felt on their journey, despite having completely different stories. This is just one example of Team Asano's masterful understanding of emotion. Emotions are not unique; if it's a real emotion, then anyone can relate to it, because we are all human. Hearing those melodies again made me feel those intended emotions twice as strongly, as I thought of my past adventures in the continent of Orsterra as well as my current ones in Solistia.

Something I love about this series is how much the story feels like it ties into the gameplay and vice versa, and they went above and beyond this time to give us some jaw-dropping moments with the path actions at the end of each story. They somehow even managed to weave in the new day/night cycle mechanic into the plot.

The world is even more fun to explore due to the addition of boats and the way the map is less predictable to navigate. I think there are also more bosses to defeat, or at least they are spread out better. I still recommend equipping the Evasive Maneuvers scholar skill to reduce the encounter rate, making it just right as you explore. The chapters are also less formulaic this time around, making it so you don't know for sure what to expect from a given chapter. The post-game is much expanded as well, with some fully voiced side-quests that let you see what happened to some important characters in the story. Speaking of, the Japanese voice acting performances are absolutely fantastic and full of life.

The new cross paths really help tie everything together. And when I say everything ties together in the end, I mean it. Also, in the first game, a lot of the camaraderie between your party members came from your own imagination and roleplay. I'm glad that aspect is still present throughout the game, but there's a lot more jerky around the bone this time around, if you will. The final segment of the game made everyone feel even closer than I imagined my party in the first game to be, boosting the affection I have for these characters even more.

As the end approached, I didn't want to say goodbye. I'm grateful for this warm feeling... thank you for traveling with me.",10,True,"Apr 23, 2023"

There's a fun job system, reminiscent of the ones you'd find in the older Dragon Quest games. Tongue-in-cheek callbacks to other popular JRPGs are everywhere, from direct references to Dragon Quest to more subtle nods like the ""New Age Hippie"" that was one of the sillier enemies in Earthbound.

The story is just about what you'd expect from Yakuza; the main plot is a somewhat more serious crime drama, while the subplots are every bit as zany as the ones in Kazuma Kiryu's adventures in the previous games. One of the best modern RPGs I've had the pleasure of playing.",10,True,"Jul 3, 2023"

All touch the perfection for me and in every city I discovering it was a real expierence for me. All it was so beautiful and the game has something to put you inside. How you move the char and you feel it. Is like you really you are inside in this place and feel all these things around you.

Nier Automata,524220,Valeriaaaaa,"Personally, my expectation from an RPG game is definitely having combo mechanics in combat. In my opinion, this was one of the biggest shortcomings of Nier. When we look at other RPG games like Devil May Cry or Final Fantasy, we see that they do this very well. We experience combat at its peak with dozens of combo mechanics. Nier, on the other hand, only offers us 2 different attack options and doesn't really showcase the combo differences between weapons. For example, I didn't see much animation difference between swords. I don't know. Nier disappointed me in this regard, although the combat animations are quite nice. The second issue is the insufficient variety of enemies. I don't call the same robot with some metal scraps added on top and its level increased a different type of enemy. Another issue is the environment design; I really didn't expect it to be this weak. If you want to understand what I mean, just look at the Abandoned City map. That's all I have to say. This game, which has the potential to be much better and to enter the top 10 of the greatest RPG games, has been left in the lurch. It's sad that it is so little known even with 2B's influence. When I ask anyone around me, I hear that the only reason they play this game is 2B. It actually explains a lot...",7,True,"Jul 15, 2024"

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,CnPx98,"This game is really underrated. I thought the story was amazing and because of the interactions I focused even more then I would whilst watching TV which made it even better. I really loved all the characters and found them all interesting. The game can be slow at times but even during them moments I never lost interest because the story still was moving forward at a good pace.

A couple of things that I didn't like was that the game was way to easy. I know it focusing on Story telling but still would have been nice if on the odd occasion something challenged you like QTEs (Quick time events) or some harder puzzles. A couple missions were kind of detective sort of thing but they were mostly self explanatory.
Another thing that was frustrating but not really an issue with the actual gameplay. For some reason when I 1st installed the game it kept crashing after completing chapter 1 and loading chapter 2. I tried verifying files (Xbox App) and that didn't fix the issue. When I reinstalled it was fine thou. Mite have been a corrupt file or something. It was saying something about a UE4 siren but no error code.
Another thing to note was that throughout the hole game I was getting random screen tearing during cutscenes. I tried messing about with video settings but nothing solved the problem. Apparently it is just an issue with the game. Its annoying thou cos the game has been out half a year and this should be fixed.

The main story itself is neither particularly innovative nor offers many surprises. Still, I liked the way the story was told and it makes you think about it even after you've finished. It changes from sad to happy situations without exaggerating them.

Unfortunately, there are hardly any decision-making options and if there are any, they have little effect, but that didn't bother me personally.

As usual in Life is Strange, you spend most of your time walking around, talking to other people and listening to monologues about things. The last one could have been shortened to a more bearable level for my taste. At least it gives you a bit more context sometimes.

If you don't like games like this, which focus very much on the story and offer hardly any gameplay, you won't be happy with True Colors.

The story can be brutally sad at points though so don't say I didn't warn you.

The Walking Dead,207610,onyxian,"The Story

The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts brings you into an apocalyptic world where zombies roam the world. Throughout the game you play as Daryl Dixon, one of the main characters from the television show. In Survival Instincts, the story line gives general players and fans of The Walking Dead and insight look of how Daryl, and his brother Merle Dixon, met up with the main group and what they went through before that time occurred as well as show how Daryl achieved his ever-so famous crossbow.

The Graphics

Graphics quality in Survival Instincts somewhat lacks a dynamic punch, for example a walkers, otherwise known as a zombie, hair looks like it was made of glue or clay then molded onto the head. However, the diversity of each walkers face has it's own unique pattern of bite marks, scratches, shapes of the jaw, teeth and more, these all add to a good fright factor at the right moment of time e.g in a dark room, turning round and a walker attacks you out of no where. There are a great amount of bugs relating to graphics, such as broken fence pieces still floating midair, gates flashing black when opened, walkers floating when killed. All around missions have invisible walls, preventing you from going further away from the current map without any sort of police barricade, for example, taking away a bit of the realistic touch.

The Mechanics and sound

The AI is very sloppy, throughout gameplay I had opened a metal fence and the walkers still attacked the fence, paying no attention to me whatsoever, I then began to kill them one by one. When one walker died another took its place, as if they were lining up to die. The scavenging mechanics allow you to gather survivors and send them out to gather supplies, but the amount of survivors depends on the size of the car you currently have. That said, there are missions that allow you to find car keys to either bigger, or smaller, cars. When sending out survivors to scavenge for supplies, there is always a chance of getting them killed by walkers, depending on what item you give them to defend themselves with as each survivor has their own skill trait such as being good at using blunt weapons. There were countless sound bugs within this game, fences breaking with the sound of wood getting chopped, walkers dying with the sound of a metal fence breaking and more. The game includes a feature where the player can choose a method of travel such as highways, streets and backroads. Depending on what method you choose, one method can either consume less fuel or another method may take a road such as backroads where it consumes a lot of fuel with a high chance of breaking down. If, by chance, your car breaks down or runs out of fuel, a side mission will take place allowing you to scavenge the nearby area for fuel or car hose. The issue with the side missions is that they're very repetitive, as there are about 3-4 different areas.

The Gameplay

It felt a bit stiff trying to kill walkers, e.g using the sledgehammer was a lot quicker than normal. One thing that gives a good addition to gameplay is sneaking around, trying to sneak past walkers and stealth killing them by sneaking up from behind and executing the stealth kill action. Like any realistic movie or game, gun fire attracts walkers to your location so be sure to only use your gun in dire situations and ammo is scarce to watch out, you don't want to run out of ammo when you desperately need it. If you ever happen to get grabbed by a walker, it activates a grappling mechanic where the player must place the circle onto the walkers head, activate the attack trigger and stab them in the head. This method breaks fighting gameplay by 50% due to the fact after killing the walker that grabbed you, if there is another walker, it will grab you almost instantly after you let go of the previous walker, this allows you to kill over 15 walkers without using any ammo, losing any health and just drains the fun and realism out of the game entirely. On the last mission, near the very end the last thing you did is mount a military vehicles machine gun and kill any incoming zombies, after which it cuts to black screen and goes to the credits, without showing you how exactly Daryl and Merle met the group like the game was purposely made for.

Final Verdict

The game seems rushed, only to gain quick money. For the price of $49.99 or £31.99 makes the game a complete rip off, due to the lack of effort of the game. I feel the only reason others need to buy this game, is to play as Daryl Dixon and get to see Merle, even though he is barely in the game.

The Walking Dead,207610,Sky-Moondrift,"An atrocious game, And possibly one of the worst Ports in video game history. I could only stomach about 40 minutes of this trash until I wanted to throw my mouse at the wall.

The graphics look like a Playstation 1 game, the sounds are repetitive and annoying, but the one thing that makes this game total garbage is the horrifying controls, most notably the forced Mouse Acceleration that makes aiming and navigating a complete disaster.

Not only does it have the most **** Mouse Acceleration, but the mouse aiming will just glitch out and start sticking on different parts of the screen.

Oxenfree,282140,Simoss13,"Oxenfree delivers a thrilling experience which delves into the supernatural. You start as a teenager (Alex about 17) and she is accompanied by some friends to have a good time on a remote island. Things suddenly go pear shape as you awaken an ancient spirit that can possess and disorientates you and your friends.
The theme and interaction of characters is top notch, I am always wanting to know more about these characters lives and situations to lead them to being who and why they are. These spirits leech onto Alex's insecurities through the game and provoking unresolved issues.
At this point I should add the voice acting and character interaction is what really executed the plot and brought the game together as a whole. If it wasn't for voice acting and characters, I cannot see how this game would of panned out.
I really like thrillers that also develop characters and showing a 'coming of age' undertone. Movies such as 'IT' is a prime example of this. Although a different plot, it has that common theme. I scare easily so having an emotional personal plot really brings depth making it tolerable.
The art style and visual effects in the game are also breathtaking as it really immerse you in the games theme making me disorientated.
The major complaint I have on this game is the actual gameplay itself. It felt like a visual novel and walking sim, therefore the game play and skill is minimal. You have dialect choices constantly in the game which is great. I just wished they allowed me to select an option after a character has spoken, as the game seems to force me to choose and interrupt another characters dialogue. This can distract on the brilliant voice acting and plot which bothered me.
The game is priced well for a 4 hour adventure and if you want to see alternative endings (like me) you will give a second try to see how you choice matter in the end credits",8,True,"Jul 4, 2021"

A Short Hike,1044720,Merse,"A Short Hike es una experiencia hermosa que le deseo a todo el mundo. Es un juego reconfortante, con un arte bellísimo y un estilo pixelado por defecto que lo hace entrañable. La música es otra de las grandes virtudes que hacen de este juego una obra maestra, fuera de Nintendo recuerdo pocos juegos con bandas sonoras tan maravillosas. El personaje que controlas en el juego es Claire, un pájaro que va a la isla de la que viene su familia con su tía para alejarse de la ciudad y pasar el verano. Al despertarse cuenta que está esperando una llamada y no llega, entonces su tía le dice que ahí no hay cobertura, que solo la hay en Hawk Peak, el pico más alto de la isla. Así, Claire se decide a hacer la ruta, y en el camino se encuentra con toda suerte de personajes con actividades e historias interesantes. Aficionados a la pesca, jugadores de una nueva especie de variedad de Volley cooperativo en la que siempre ganas, un atleta que achaca sus victorias a su vincha de la suerte y termina reconociendo que sus éxitos vienen de su trabajo y no de la suerte, un pintor que insiste en pintar cosas que no le convencen para complacer a otros hasta que decide pintar lo que le gusta de verdad, un escritor trabajando en el final de su novela, unos escaladores un tanto lamentables, etc. Al llegar arriba del todo, Claire contempla el espectacular escenario en el que hay una aurora boreal. Entonces recibe una llamada, la que tanto llevaba esperando: es su madre. Conocemos que se ha sometido a una operación, de la cual no avisó a Claire, y por eso ella tenía tantas ganas de recibir la llamada y hablar con su madre. Sabemos que todo está bien, también comenta su madre que Claire ya es mayor y pronto ya no la necesitará. “Nunca dejaré de necesitarte. Te quiero, mamá”, responde ella. Todo esto sucede mientras suena una melodía preciosa, posiblemente la mejor del juego, con lo que es imposible no emocionarse en este momento, que ya es una de las memorias más bonitas que guardo de un videojuego.

Balatro,2379780,Nazrielau05,"After 4 hours of playing Balatro, i think I've shaped up a reasonable opinion;Yes, i could see why this game took the world by storm. It's incredibly intuitive in user interface design and combat mechanics. The soundtrack is cool, the visuals are okay, and the gameplay in general is addicting. But for me, that's when it ends.I absolutely have a certain bias against this game and I'll admit that. When i see reviews on Steam and Metacritic, i feel like people are praising this game just for the sake of it. They're mentioning these, very VERY basic structures and spices for any Rogue-like game entry. ""No two Balatro match is truly the same"", ""The game's deep mechanics deserves so much love"", as if those two things aren't always THE standard of a rogue-like game???Maybe my bias is; I'm a very seasoned Rogue-like player. Hades, Inscryption, Slay the Spire, Risk of Rain 2, Dead Cells etc. all of these games shaped up my expectation of a rogue-like entry. While I'm not taking away the fun that people are having with Balatro (I'm absolutely having fun with the game too!), i feel like these things that people give Balatro so much credit for, aren't anything but the genre's standard for me.This game is amazing, i won't deny that. It's a great value for anyone into the rogue-like genre, but i feel like the praises this game gets are a little overblown. Compared to Slay the Spire, and Inscryption, this game stands tall as a deck builer rogue-like with a fun & charming poker game aesthetic. Presentation-wise, Balatro isn't the most interesting thing out there, not even in my gaming library. However, an amazing game is an amazing game.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,RealNova,"The game is solid, fun, and the format is finally fair (Idk how much is gonna last do), but Konami is giving almost no support to this game, there are almost no tournaments, no interesting new things etc.
I'm gonna say making decks and opening box is rewarding and its really not pay to win.
Also the game is very luck based being a best of 1 with no side deck, players hate this and Konami refuse to give us best of 3. Also its just not that interesting to play the OCG meta of 1 years ago because that is what the Master Duel format always is, they need to support the current TCG and OCG more instead of making more and more alternative formats that nobody likes.

The  best of one format is annoying but playable and it would be really nice if they implemented a banlist to follow that, but oh well.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,Revuc,"I have played MD until the end of December 2022. I would like to make it clear, that I am speaking from my own experience and as a player who went to Diamond 5 I want to give my opinion on the game.

Yes, it is true that the game is a good F2P, at first. Newcomers will receive a good amount of Gems and support to make a few decks of your choice, be it for casual or ranking. However, the Gems' income from playing the game alone becomes quickly inefficient. At the moment, I have stopped playing, you make 145 to 195 Gems from doing daily missions by playing in rankings or events, including logins and watching live duels. Those Gems are necessary to acquire cards. For 10 packs of 10 cards, you are guaranteed to received at least a SR, it cause 1000 Gems, plus if you have no UR the next 10 packs guarantee 1 UR. A F2P player can only acquire 1 bundle of 10 packs per week. It is true tournaments and events gives you more Gems through their own missions, but those aren't always available and you need those Gems to get those packs.

Speaking of packs, I would like to speak about the issue with them. MD announced a new selected pack with 4 new archetypes in it. So I kept my Gems from my missions, since I was interested. I accumulated over 4 000 gems. When the selected pack was released, I bought the bundle of 10 packs 4 times. The results I got was, 2 out of the 10 URs necessary to play this deck. The biggest issue I have is that they aren't doing a specific pack like they did with previous archetype on release date and even if they did, I still need to buy 10 packs or craft a SR or UR card of that specific archetype just to have access to that archetype pack and said pack will be only available for 24 hours, regardless if the client is down or not.

The material system of MD works as the following; you have a card you don't need, you have the option to destroy this card and create 10 materials equals to this card's rarity and quality. For example; if I destroy 1 UR non-foil I get 10 UR materials, if it was foil = 15 UR and rainbow foil = 30 UR. From those materials, you need 30 to create a card from the same rarity then those materials; so 30 UR to get 1 UR cards. Which mean, if I don't buy many random packs and get multiple URs and SRs I don't need I'll never get those more difficult URs to get. Also, I couldn't destroy more URs, because some of them are classified as Legacy, which you can't destroy even if you have extras of. Plus, it's not possible to try out a deck before using your resources on, the only exception is if they are available on Story Mode, but they restrict what you can play in the structure deck.

My biggest complaint in the gameplay is the absurd amount of time to play a turn. I had to wait 6 to 8 minutes to play my turn, or when my opponent takes 3 to 4 minutes to decide to play that  face-down Called by the Grave. I should not wait so, so, so long to play my turn and my cards. The turn should be restrict to five minutes or a penalty for inactivity of 20 to 30 seconds, punishing those who make the decks and immediately play them without taking the time to read their effects.

The ranking system is flawed. You can only climb the ranks. This is an issue, since you are stuck on the rank you have climb to and there's no penalty to lose multiple matches. Which mean, if you are at Platinum, but your deck isn't strong enough to defeat anyone, you are stuck at Platinum until the end of that season making duel experience miserable. The ranking should work around the experience of the players and not the amount of duels they have won in a row. Free to play isn't an option, since it is completely random and the only way for me to know the level of the opponent I'm getting in is through the brief description of the room.

As for those other ways to duels, with the exception to ranks and events, they are useless. You can't get Gems except those two modes. Unless you are playing with a friend in free duels, there's no need to play Free, Story or multiplayer if you want your daily Gems. Also, forget to surrender if you have to go and still manage to pull off the mission during your rank duel, because you need to either win or lose the duel to complete your mission.

Since decks can be difficult to make because of the limited resources, events are hard to complete since those are characteristic specific. Making your duels boring and difficult, since the other option, rent decks, are terrible.

Finally, I spent a large amount of money in the hopes to get more decks and further the ranks, however my attempt was futile since I buying so much gave me nothing in return. Not even enough to get the cards I wished to craft. If the situation was in real life, I would have at least have the possibility to sell the unwanted cards to get a bit of my money back.

Yes, this game is F2P, but don't do the same mistake I made. Don't spent for a possibility.

Thank you for your time and have a good day.",1,False,"Feb 3, 2023"
Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,Giovanilevin,"First thing first i'm a beginer, i never played this game in any form before... basically i'm a complete noob and my comment is a bit long but it's just my honest opinion x)

For me there are 2 obvious problems in this ""game"" that popped real quick :
1- the mentality of the players...
It is clear that many of them have nothing against those who play differently and remain fairplay.
However, the vast majority of comments I have read were at best disrespectful at worst insulting to anyone who didn't play like them, be it users of old decks, new ones or blockers.
2- Considering the glaring differences between the old fast decks and the new slow ones, there should be the possibility to choose between the 2 game's modes.

For me a good game is a game that gives everyone a chance to play in their own way, to find a playstyle that suit them, not a game that seems to offer several archetypes to finally just impose one or two.
Balance issues in PvP games are everywhere but this is the first time I see something like this or at least feel this way.

I dont care about wining or loosing, what i want is to have fun while playing/learning something that is new to me.
So now I have 3 choices :
- I stop,
- I build a floodgate deck since these meta decks really don't interest me,
- i forfeit everytime i end up against one of those decks (wich seeems a bit unrealistic since the vast majority is made of them).

The worst thing is that feeling of copy/paste between my opponents, i swear i checked their names just to be sure it wasn't the same player --'

O card game é e sempre será divertido, porém já faz tempo que a Konami não faz um game a altura.
Resumindo, para um jogo lançado em 2022, parece que tudo foi feito com pressa e apenas para cumprir tabela.
Não me leve a mal, mas toda a diversão que você vai ter nesse game é proveniente do próprio card game, e não do jogo ""MASTER DUEL"", que poderia fazer MUITO mais do que fez.
O modo solo é simplesmente esquecível.
Se você esperava alguma atenção para modos de jogo não competitivos, esqueça, o jogo simplesmente não te recompensa se você não buscar o competitivo.

E pior, o competitivo também é largado, com uma ranqueada sem novidades ou recompensas relevantes, eventos feitos esporadicamente e também sem um sistema de recompensa legal.

O jogo também te trava de várias formas claramente artificiais, pra não te dar recompensas. Exemplos: pacote de cartas legado (recompensa pelos duelos ranqueados), só te dão 2 cartas por pacote, além de dar cartas irrelevantes e que não podem virar recurso pra fazer novas cartas; gema pela subida de nível na ranqueada (uma das melhores formas de juntar gemas, mas, a cada nova season você não vai voltar da ranqueada do zero, isso pra te travar de obter recursos de subida de nível) e por ai vai.
No geral, você começa sendo bombardeado de recursos, mas depois o negócio simplesmente desanda de uma maneira que estraga a experiência, parece que o jogo não quer mais que você jogue.

What is the genre?

Its less **** and more of Physics-Engine.

Are there any similar games or is it a sequel?

It's like Garys Mod or something along those lines. Its a not in its self but its a Physics Engine that allows the users to play any game that they want.

How is the gameplay?

As I said before, it gives options to allow users or players to play any game. Specifically any card, board or tabletop game. Tabletop Simulator comes with a few basic games but where the application truly excels is in the  Steam Workshop where there are thousands of games. It's a great way to try new games before spending $70-80.

How is the offline and online?

It includes both, I have yet to play online with other people but I have played locally and it works very well.

Is there any single player?

Of course, you can. You can download Mods that have single player. You can also create your own games. The nice thing is, its a great way to playtest a new game that you're working on.

Would I recommend it?

Absolutely, I keep trying to get my friends to get the game. We used to get together and play Tabletop games every Sunday but then one of my closest friends moved away. Now obviously don't get together to play tabletop games, I keep telling them that this is a fantastic alternative.

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,Nove123,"What is this game is difficult to notice among many indie games, as it seems at first glance one figurative. But is it? Today I want to make a remark about what to look at it. Well, let's start with the visual, it's beautiful here, these words will be enough. And what about the gameplay has something to say. Firstly, he is strongly associated with music here and it is damn unusual in comparison with today's indie games. Secondly, its dynamism in some moments just rolls over, sometimes you don't even know where to hide in order to survive. The plot is here, but it is difficult to call it not childish, because it is built on friendship and mutual assistance. But in addition to the advantages in the game there are downsides, but rather they are connected with my preferences.
Firstly, the duration of the game is negligible, because it took me almost 2 hours to go through it. Secondly, there are too few music levels here, as they depend on the amount of music, but all music is not really them, therefore I see no reason to add so little music. And then there are some problems with complexity. Since it is at some points off scale, and in most cases average. If you warn us about the occurrence of epilepsy and you are aimed at a Danish audience, then why add casual mode, you'd better add a more complicated mode.
Summing up, I want to say, if you like the genre of dubstep music, electro and you want to have a nice evening, then this game is just born for you, since there is online and cooperative modes and answering the question: ""Is the game worth the money?"" I can answer: ""Yes worth it!"".",9,True,"Jun 1, 2019"

Unrailed,1116740,savvym,"Coop or competitive online game about making way for your railroads which you have to build fast. You control a character with basic movements and you only use two tools, one for wood and one for stone. Furthermore you can equip your train with extra wagons and improvements, such as dynamite producer, extra space, ghost wagons, jet pack and such.

GAMEPLAY 5/5
The game is divided by stages, so your goal in each one is to reach the final station by putting down the rails in front of your train. If you fail, the train will derail and game over. The players tend to block each other, even the terrain complicates movement. They can use predetermined icons for simple interactions.

GRAPHICS 3/5
Very simplistic, colorful and in later stage somehow confusing change of perspective. There are few models of character. There is a day and night cycle, during night each player has its own small light radius. Orientation and planning is important. The map moves slowly to the right towards the final station as the train moves, leaving the left side of the map covered but the player can wander off there. The main menu is nicely done controlled as if playing game itself.

REPLAY VALUE 5/5
The coop offers three difficulties and few modes. As you progress further, you have new fauna and flora, some is just annoying, some dangerous, some slows you down and some prevents you from advancement. You can collect some yellow things while running around. Each map is randomly generated seed.

MUSIC 5/5
It is soothing, little playful, good ambient sounds, not distracting from my objectives and nice at the same time.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
Non-gaming.

HOW DIFFICULT
Normal and Hard. Gets really nerving when your team does a lot of mistakes.

HOW LONG TO FINISH
Competitive mode lasts for few seconds, depending on the player skills and speed. Other mode can be endless.

VERDICT 9/10
Entertaining.

Original coop multiplayer with simple controls and limited maps. It is like Minecraft from a top-down view with objectives, the map keeps track of your distance so when the game is over, you will see a presentation of all your railroad through the map which is a satisfying look.

Nuclear Throne,242680,VahNabooty,Wonderful roguelike thats very fast paced and has a great amount of content. Gunplay is some of the best I've played in a game.,9,True,"Apr 3, 2019"
Nuclear Throne,242680,DeaDMeme,"Nuclear Throne is a brilliant example of everything and anything that a top-down rogue-like shooter should strive to be and have. It's a game in which you play as one of many unique and different characters, each with their own special attributes and abilities and fight through all the enemies on any given floor. On each floor, you find new guns ammo and sometimes secrets.
Your objective is to get as far as you can floor after floor, kill after kill, bullet after bullet. It's a very simple concept a mite more simple than other games that try and do this like Enter the Gungeon or Risk of Rain as they are a little more mechanically intensive than nuclear throne while this causes a slight lack of mechanical depth this is more than made up for in the simplistic fun the game offers. Everything from just shooting a new gun to destroying the nuclear throne itself feels good. out of the massive library of guns, you'll find not one doesn't feel good to shoot with and use. That's not to say that there aren't any bad guns as there are certainly some that are worse than others and others which are better. Which brings me to the next point of game balance.
All of the game balance is done very well in terms of the player's arsenal as the way the game handles it is by giving the player some of the worse guns early on and holding the good stuff till later on, and when I say good stuff I mean Gatling rocket launchers and cluster nuke guns. While this is done very fairly, the game is a rogue-like and relies on replay-ability, while the guns early on are for the most part bad if you are lucky you could just come across a heavy crossbow and other weapons a cut above the cloth from the first level standard.
In terms of the game's aesthetics, the pixel art is both wacky cool and imaginative with funny and unique art for the enemies and bosses. On the other hand due to the simplistic gameplay and the simple geometry of the rooms gameplay can get repetitive for some but I find that to be a factor more dependant on the player than it is the game.
Overall I think nuclear throne is a fantastic example of what a good roguelike shooter should be like, fun gameplay fantastic replayability and an encouragement to keep playing to experience all the content.",9,True,"Jun 7, 2018"

Enter the Gungeon,311690,maluigario,"TL;DR: Fun, hilarious, and cute. If you have had an iota of fun with a twin stick shooter or want to try one for the first time, GET THIS GAME.

DISCLAIMER: Got this game free on Epic Games.

I had seen this game from afar, never committed to buying it. I'd never even enjoyed a twin-stick shooter before. I don't think this has changed my opinion on the genre, but I LOVE this game.

Everything in this game is stylized to the max, with every enemy being a gun reference. The enemies are bullets that hold guns that shoot bullets, and your job is to shoot bullets at the bullets while dodging their bullets while not taking contact damage from the gun-weilding bullets. Sometimes your bullets are actually fish. Sometimes your gun has a mermaid tail. Sometimes it's a reference to a unique gun from some other media, like Halo or Hyper Light Drifter or Judge Dredd. And sometimes your gun is a bullet that shoots guns that shoots more bullets, so you can shoot guns full of bullets at the gun-weilding bullets.

The bosses are hysterically named and genuinely difficult to fight. There's a gorGUN, or AMMOconda or a king bullet **** on his flying throne of guns.

There is so much to unlock in this game. Besides your 4 starting characters, there are 4 more unlockable characters. There's an actual story in here worth digging for. There's like 4 different extra modifiers for different ways to play, like a Turbo mode that speeds everything up or a challenge mode that adds a random challenge to every room and boss.

The one and only beef I have with this game is that some of the quests you have to do to unlock everything can get a little tedious. And that's a small beef for something that a player not interested in unlocking EVERYTHING will not even endure. The fact that I could get some 40 hours of gameplay in what is essentially a roguelike with a small fixed number of floors before finding something tedious is a testament to how fun this game as a whole is. I've unlocked everything and I still play this regularly just for fun.",10,True,"Dec 5, 2022"

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,Thyi,"Eu até iria dar uma nota 9 para o Rogue Legacy 2. Ele é um jogo incrível. Passei muito tempo jogando-o com bastante prazer. E até mesmo hoje ainda jogo as vezes. Porém, não dá pra ignorar certas coisas que optaram por fazer no jogo. Mas, apesar disso, continua sendo um ótimo jogo.

A primeira coisa, é que o RL 2 em muitos aspectos é basicamente uma cópia do RL 1, mas com melhorias estéticas e mais polimento. Eu não joguei o 1, então, para mim isso não fez a menor diferença. Mas com certeza pra quem jogou, isso pode ter sido um grande problema.
Outras coisas que me incomodaram bastante durante a gameplay, foram algumas escolhes de design do jogo. A esquiva colidir com os inimigos e causar dano ao jogador não me parece correto. Apesar de que eu me acostumei com isso depois, ainda acho que deveria ser uma esquiva que realmente esquiva dos ataques, como na maioria dos jogos. A Cellar Door também exagerou na quantidade de elementos que podem causar dano ao jogador. São várias armadilhas, elementos do cenário, excesso de projeteis inimigos que, inclusive, alguns atravessam paredes. Além dos próprios inimigos, é claro, que causam dano com ataques e ainda com seu próprio contato físico.
Sobre as classes e ataques em geral, eu acho que ficou bem esquisito os ataques de algumas classes em certas ocasiões. O bárbaro, por exemplo, quase não tem dano aéreo, pois seu ataque no ar é muito fraco e ruim de controlar. Isso faz com que acertar inimigos no ar seja um GRANDE empecilho. A falta de direcionar o ataque para a direção que você quer atrapalha muito algumas classes, como mago, boxeador, assassino. Aliás, a classe assassino é uma das piores, por além do seu dano ser baixo, é terrível no ar.
Felizmente, no geral os talentos das classes são bons, e mudam bastante a gameplay. Já as magias... simplesmente não se encaixam bem no jogo. A maioria são sem sentido e ruim de usar. Algumas são muito melhores que outras. O Tiro Calcinante é basicamente melhor que qualquer uma das magias para o mago. E pra classes baseadas em dano físico, com exceção de algumas, as magias são muito dispensáveis.
Sobre a variedade de cenários e inimigos, eu acredito que seja outro ponto negativo. Só há 6 biomas. O que é muito pouco mesmo para um roguelite, que é um jogo que iremos jogar por horas e horas. Comparando com o Dead Cells, lá tem diversos biomas, e você não irá passar por todos na mesma run. Eu sinto que nele os mapas são bem menos repetitivos. O que dá uma sobrevida ao jogo. Já no RL 2, fica muito maçante o começo no Castelo, e depois o mesmo percurso. Sempre com os mesmos 6 biomas. Pra piorar, os chefes só enfrentamos uma vez por ""finalização"". E com isso, eu quero dizer que mesmo que você jogue várias runs, o chefe que você matou já era, e só vai enfrentá-lo novamente após finalizar a história, e de novo só depois que finalizar novamente a história, e assim por diante. Isso torna o jogo ainda mais repetitivo e um pouco maçante. E os inimigos serem basicamente os mesmos em diferentes biomas, porém ""evoluídos"", não ajuda nem um pouco. Realmente faltou uma maior variedade de inimigos. Até tem inimigos exclusivos de cada bioma, mas são minoria. E no geral, realmente é o mesmo inimigo com um visual um pouco mais parrudo e com golpes melhores.

Sobre a narrativa do jogo, eu sinto que foi muito deixada de lado. Basicamente quase toda a história principal é contada através de anotações. Pouquíssimas interações com NPC durante a run (acho que dá pra contar nos dedos). E pra variar, isso deixa a run ainda mais repetitiva. Fazendo um paralelo com Dead Cells, ou Hades, nesses jogos você encontra NPCs em cada run. E desenvolve uma narrativa através deles. É algo bem mais fácil de entender, e mais interessante do que apenas ler uma anotação que torna uma história simples em algo confuso de entender. Ao menos os NPCs do lobby são muito carismáticos, e interagem bastante, com diversas falas. Esse padrão deveria acontecer durante a run. Agregaria bastante.

Por fim, as melhorias e itens do jogo. É triste que eu finalizei a história do jogo e não fiz uma build completa com as armaduras. Ou seja, com os buffs máximos do set. Por exemplo, o set do Protetor dá destreza no primeiro e segundo nível, e chance de crítico no terceiro. Após finalizar, é possível conseguir armaduras de nível mais alto, e algumas eu acho que só são possíveis de obter no NG+. O que é uma pena, porque uma coisa tão legal ficou basicamente de fora da principal parte do jogo. Sobre as melhorias, são bem bacanas. Porém, a chance de crítico só passa a ser usada muuuito depois. Não faz sentido. O crítico desse jogo é basicamente só o crítico de perícia, que acontece numa situação específica. Pois conseguir chance de crítico aleatório, é só com bastante tempo de jogo.",9,True,"May 10, 2023"

Monster Train,1548850,Vulgrim,"I watched the game for a long time before buying it and saw its potential. Currently, it may not have a lot of possibilities, but as I mentioned - it has the potential for much more.
In my opinion, it is more fun to play than Slay the Spire, if only because of a more thoughtful system of improving cards (because we decide ourselves how we improve our creatures and spells) and the requirement of more frequent combinatorics. For me, an advantage (though probably not everyone likes it that much) is the lack of annoying RNG, which will quickly destroy our approach. We also have interesting multi modes and interestingly designed daily challenges. The soundtrack is also very nice.
Of course, as in any game of this type, we would like there to be even more cards, artifacts, enemies, etc. This is also the case, but I don't think the game will stop as it is.
In addition, I hope that in the future the creators will develop their game, which at the time of release seems to offer more than Slay the Spire after adding (years later) the fourth character.

Monster Train,1548850,Mirrorminx,"This is the most content-rich deckbuilder rogue like game out there, and has a huge breadth of interesting mechanics, choices, and difficulty that make it stand apart from it's competitors. Many reviews compare this to Slay the Spire, which is a great, but straightforward game. This game has a LOT more varied mechanics, strategies, and deck styles, with five factions, units & spell based strategies. Cards can be individually customized with upgrades, and refining your deck is about much more than just trimming your deck down to a lean machine (which is the optimal strategy in most other deck builders). While some cards are niche, every unit and card has a place in an interesting strategy, and the starting faction (Hellhorned) barely scratches the surface of what lies beneath.

Don't buy this if you don't like deck builders: while it is mechanically very different from Slay the Spire, the deck and cards still form the backbone of how you play. But truly, this game is genre-defining, it does so many things well, and after having played dozens of deck builders on mobile and pc, this is by far my favorite in this genre",10,True,"Oct 28, 2020"

Hades II,1240440,Valentin2227,"Après avoir découvert le premier Hades l’année dernier, Hades 2 était devenu automatiquement l’une de mes plus grosse attentes pour cette année et Hades 2 a clairement survolé et dépassé les attentes que j’avais autour de lui.


point positif

 - Bon commençons par le plus gros point fort de Hades 2 c’est sont système de combat, déjà que celui du premier était de très haut volé, celui de Hades 2 c’est tout simplement de l’art, j’ai rarement vu un système de combat aussi riche, profond, varié et maîtrisé dans ces mécaniques. J’ai beau avoir dépassé les 100h de jeu je trouve les combats toujours autant addictif et grisant, chaque run est vraiment différent à jouer en grande partie grâce a la multitude quasiment infini de build différents possibles ( armes de départ, bienfaits, carte de taro…).

- Il y’a beaucoup de nouveautés apportées par Hades 2 et elles sont quasiment toutes ultra kiffant que se soit l’ajout de la mécanique de magie, les cartes de taro, les infusions, les nouveaux dieux ou encore le fait d’avoir le choix entre 2 run différents au départ (enfer, surface)…

- Hades 2 vient aussi quasiment gommer l’un des défaut de Hades 1 qui pouvait devenir un peu répétitif notamment a cause du fait qui n’y avait ""que"" 4 régions et boss différents mais dans Hades 2 et l’ajout de la run à la surface avec ces régions et boss différents vient vraiment casser cette répétitiviter 

- Les nouvelles armes sont à la fois toutes ultra kiffant à manier mais aussi totalement différent dans leur manière de ce jouer.

- Tout les boss sont très stylé à affronter notamment grâce à leur musique et patern vraiment kiffant.

- Tout les musiques sont du miel pour les oreilles !!!!

- La DA du jeu est tout simplement somptueuse   


Point négatif

 - L’histoire est un peu moins bien écrite que dans Hades 1 , les dialogues et les personnages sont aussi un peu moins intéressants que ceux du première opus mais reste comme même cool à suivre

 - Tout les nouveautés de Hades 2 sont très cool sauf une : les épreuves du chaos que j’ai trouvé vraiment pas intéressante et sans intérêt 

- les boss finaux de Hades 2 sont très cool mais reste vraiment moins bien que celui de Hades 1 

Pour conclure Hades 2 est un jeu terriblement addictif, grisant et qui possède l’un des meilleurs système de combat que j’ai pu jouer. Hades 2 a parfaitement réussi à renouveler la formule initié par le premier opus en ajoutant plein de nouvelles mécanique. Hades 2 est tout simplement un très grand chef d’œuvre du jeux vidéo.",9,True,"Oct 27, 2025"

This game is simply **** presentation is otherworldy! The art style, animation, voice acting, soundtrack/sound design in general—this game grabs you into it's world and doesn't let go until you kill the Titan of **** course, in a Rogue-like dungeon-crawling game such as this one, the combat mechanics is what matters the most. This game's mechanics is incredibly deep. It has it's own sauces and quirks—it stands perfectly fine on it's own and when compared to the first game.Incredible game so far. Easy reccomendation to any fan of Hades 1, or any action Rogue-like enjoyer for that matter. You'll get your money's worth with this game. Hell, with this quality? you might feel like you're robbing the developers by not paying more—such is the experience of playing high quality Indie games.

[Post-game review]I fully finished the story campaign after 40+ hours! This game is wonderful—My perfect image of an action Rogue-like experience. Alongside Hades 1 itself as well as something like Dead Cells.I got no new inputs about the game honestly. The story is pretty good early and halfway through. I'm inclined to follow one of those people who aren't into the ending. The game's ending isn't bad of course, just badly executed.I actually don't care about the story. I know it's a weird thing to say about a Hades game—since it's one of the few reasons why Hades 1 was so beloved. But a story isn't what i look for in a game.What i look for in a game is; presentation like visual style, sound design, character designs, as well as the gameplay mechanics in general. Hades 2 delivers all of that with grace. And i for one, couldn't be more grateful.",10,True,"Oct 20, 2025"

So far in my playtime, I have found no bugs or issues or really even anything that felt unfair. The rules of the game make sense, are fair, are fun, and still manage to be challenging.

The inclusion of being able to add any song you want to the game really brings this game over the top. On top of that, they added support for the steam workshop for mods. Allowing customizability is always something games should do.",9,True,"Feb 12, 2020"
Cult of the Lamb,1205140,MimicTheShadows,"This game is severely underrated and very overlooked compared to many other top notch indie games.
Taking care of your cult is, while not all that complex, fun and provides some good downtime while preparing for your next crusade.
The combat is serviceable and does what it has too but it can get repetitive pretty fast. This was a lot worse in earlier versions of the game but has gotten better with the introduction of relics and heavy attacks. I’m sure the upcoming DLC will work to fix this major issue and if it does I’ll update this review,
Now if that was all I’d probably rate this game a 6 or a 7 but the big thing that really pulled me in was the lore.
The Story itself is fine. Most will not get much out of it other than a reason to kill the bosses and a means to an end, but a lot of the world building in this game is actually fantastic and has kept me intrigued for the last two years.
Now I want to avoid spoilers in this review so I won’t go into detail but I’m very excited for how the lore will get expanded upon in Woolhaven. 
Also the art and music are perfect for this game. I have no notes (other than the birds).

Cult of the Lamb,1205140,Nazrielau05,"This game's presentation is by far the spotlight here. The soundtrack is such a nice contrast to the rather violent visual effects this game has, that itself was already contrasted with the cartoonish/comicbook-ish art style. This combination creates an insanely well made package that sticks in my mind even compared to other games with the best of the best visual presentation.

The Rogue-like mechanics was implemented effectively here. With the inclusion of different weapons each run, different Tarot cards, and recently relics that i achieved. It's pretty much RNG-based mechanics like other Rogue-like games. The combat system feels nice as well, the rolling mechanics really forces the player to be patient and make a good position before making any move recklessly.

Another aspect of CotL is the Base building mechanics. Basically a simulator for a Cultist society. It's really fun! your death in the battle runs has consequences in the cult camp, it makes for a good balancing system for all the fighting sequences. It breaks the pacing nicely as well. Instead of one aspect of the mechanics over-taking the spotlight, these two sides of the same coin creates a shinny golden piece of currency. And you'd wanna keep these two sides in the back of your head to optimally playing through the title.",9,True,"Jul 19, 2025"

Lies of P,1888160,MumenOnline,"I had a great time with Lies of P, I can easily recommend it to anyone that enjoys Souls-like games, and I consider it the best entry outside of FromSoftware’s catalogue. For people who struggle with Souls-like games, I’m a bit on the fence about whether this one is for you. On one hand, I found a lot of the bosses easy, but difficulty definitely ramps up with the later bosses and some of the tougher enemies throughout the levels.

The biggest issue of this game is definitely the level layouts themselves. Most of them aren’t necessarily bad, but they are simplistic, meaning there wasn’t any that knocked it out the park or felt special. Later game areas frankly become a pain, especially when you combine the uninteresting level design with the game throwing annoying enemies groups at you. Exploration feels unfulfilling, and Item pickups aren’t exciting unless they’re from a chest, otherwise they’re mostly forgettable.

The game is surprisingly fluid. It has quick manoeuvrability and familiar gameplay that feels right at home if you’ve played a Souls game before. Sekiro-like deflecting is also here, which builds an invisible stagger meter and can even break your enemy’s weapon. You will likely never have to grind in this game, with weapon materials being plentiful, and progression coming naturally as long as you spend your ergo (souls) after every boss.",8,True,"Apr 19, 2025"

Mortal Shell,1203620,Wiezzel,"I tried to play it on Computer, the movement with Keyboard and mouse is utterly garbage.
When you press A or D the camera AGRESSIVELLY turns and if you are FORCED to counter act with your mouse, many times it just ignore it and turns even more. It can quickly turn into a spiral camera turning around because the design is just plain trash and there is really no defense for how bad it is.
Since the camera is really the the gate to play the game and without visibility there is not much that can be done, this game deserves a 1.

I gave 1 extra for  the graphics. They seemed nice, not mind blowing, and lacking detail, but they fit in the environment ( that is poorly designed to fight in) it is really nice to only* walk around.

There is a mind blowing amount of unstoppable cut scenes that are garbage as well. Like after the tutorial, the character SLOWLY gets out of the water taking all the time of the world and you slowly walk forward and then they make you press E to enter a tunnel as cinematic animation like, where you then press W for like 3 min straights while you crawl through a quiet ugly dumb tunnel.
Just so the devs Ego can present you  ""Mortal Shell"" on the bottom black banner .... as if anything so far was impressive. Maybe for kids under 10 that do not know any better.

The tutorial is also made abnormally slow. Too many waste of times part.

Now that all and all you wasted 80% of your time the first 1h doing utterly nothing but staring and waiting and pressing 1 button at a time, you can start walking around fighting the camera automatic adjustment mainly. You will never get used to it, I uninstalled the game after another 30 min as it was mind blowing stupid how there is no setting to change that.

After all of this, there is some fighting. Fighting is VERY easy and you will just die early on for random things you are just not aware of ( there is no intro to new enemies ) you just going to die and repeat the last 10 min gameplay, Really a design around wasting your time, not giving fun.

The fighting itself is boring, very simple, not crazy or nice action.
Regular Dodge and slash and dodge and spamm slash and your enemy cant do anything or do the Hardened thing any time. I am really not a good player and never play soul like, but this was piss easy and I tried Dark souls 1 and I actually quit this one because it was hard not trash like Mortal shell.

Thymesia,1245430,Young_Fawn,"A Solid Souls-Like Entry

Thymesia, for me, can be described as a strange combination of Bloodborne, Nioh and Sekiro.

Aesthetically it looks like Bloodborne and is about as fast paced.
Combat is a bit like Sekiro, with a strong emphasis on parrying, especially on boss fights, if you don't learn to Parry, the Bosses will put you down very quickly. It's also not hard to learn, a lot of complaints in reviews I see are people comparing it to Sekiro and then complaining about parrying? Hello?
The main Nioh aspect of it is the Plague Weapons which are a variety of different special attacks you can use and also the mission select, the game is not open world like Sekiro and Bloodborne, but level based.

The game manages to succeed in the way that all games should, it's simply very fun to play.
The enemy design is pretty basic but even the most bog standard guy can mess you up if you're not careful or you get too overzealous in your attacks.

One thing I liked is how each enemy has basically two health bars, armour and hp. You need to get the armour down so you can get access to the HP and use different attacks for each, if you spend too long dilly-dallying and not applying enough pressure, their armour bar begins to regenerate. I think it's pretty neat.

The side-quests are a must, yeah they're in the same level as you did before, similar to how Nioh's side-quests work, but you get a lot from them and some of the Bosses are strictly in Side-Quests only, so I'd highly recommend doing them, you also need their ""Cores"" for some of the different endings.

I didn't really have many problems with the game, I see people complaining about frame rate drops but I only had that for the first 10% of the first mission, it was absolutely not a consistent flaw.

Bosses are like how they are in most games of this genre, you get beat enough times to learn the attack patterns and then it just becomes about smashing them once you've got it down.

The story isn't told to you straight up, it's all done through passages and notes you find on the ground, which give you an idea of some of the history of the level and how things came to be. Again, not to keep referring to other reviews, but I don't understand why people are saying it's a comparable to Sekiro or Bloodborne and then complaining that the story isn't told to you in an obvious manner. Isn't that one of the reasons those former games were praised? Everything seems a bit hypocritical.

I guess my only complaint is that the game is quite short, you can probably finish the game in around 6-8 hours if you do all the side quests as well, but the game is only £20 so it's not that strong an argument.

I highly enjoyed my time playing Thymesia, maybe I'll go back and get some of the other endings, it was a good little experience and I really hope in a few years we'll see a sequel which is longer with a few extra mechanics added to the game. It's a solid entry into the genre and it is absolutely one of the betters ones on the market outside of Fromsoft games.

For what it is, it's a great game; something to keep you occupied for a day or two with a little bit of replayability but not a whole lot. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a game to scratch that souls-like itch which a lot of us have.

8/10, a great game for what it is and you'll have a lot of fun playing it.

Thymesia,1245430,ErayTellezi,"Soulslike oyun açlığı çekenlerin şifa niyetine tüketmeleri gereken bir iş. Büyük çaplı değil, basit ve kısa bir oyun. Ama yaptığı işi çok iyi yapıyor. Karakter ve silah gelişimi olsa da rpg elementleri çok az. Bir tane silahınız var. Ancak özel yeteneğiniz sayesinde düşmanlarınızın silahlarını bir defaya mahsus çalıp kullanabiliyorsunuz. Böylelikle ondan fazla silahı kullanmış oluyorsunuz. Bu da oyuna souls oyunlarında olmayan bir element eklemiş.

Bir diğer şey düşmanlarınıza vurduğunuzda canlarının azalması ancak pençe ile vurmadığınızda yaralarının iyileşip geri dolması. Bu yüzden normal saldırılarınızı yaptıktan kısa bir süre sonra bir kaç kez de pençe saldırısı yapmanız gerekiyor. Bu da yavaş ve defansif değil agresif oynamak zorunda olmanız demek. Ki oyunun oynanışı da bunu destekliyor. Epey hızlı bir karakterimiz var. Ne kadar hızlı olduğumuzu oyunun son boss'u olarak kendimiz gibi birisi karşımıza çıktığında anlıyoruz. Beni bir kaç saat uğraştırdı açıkçası.

Oyun atmosferi ve görselliği güzel. Müzik yok gibi bir şey. Harita dizaynı fena değil. Bir bölüme sondaki boss'u kesip gidiyorsunuz. Ama o bölümde keşfedecek küçük yerler falan var. Üst katlar vesaire. Öyle dümdüz koridorda ilerlemiyorsunuz.

Ben parry yapabildiğimiz yelpazeye benzer şeyi kullandım. Element hasarı veren, uzun menzilli olan silahlar da vardı ama bu oyun çok hızlı olması nedeniyle parry yapmak keyifli olur gibi geldi. Karakterimi de ona göre dancer sınıfından seçtim zaten.

Oyunun ortalarına kadar çeşitlilik iyi gidiyordu aslında. Yeni düşman çeşitleri geliyor, yeni yetenekler geliyor, kullanmasam da yeni silahlar ediniyordum. Ama ortalardan sonra özellikle yeni düşman çeşidi gelmemeye başladı. Boss'lar farklıydı bir tek. Ancak onların da çok kolay olduğunu söylemem gerek. Çoğunu tek denemede geçtim. Böyle soulslike oyun mu olur? Boss'lar hiç agresif değiller. Çok az vuruyorlar, genelde mal gibi vuruşlarınızı yiyip duruyorlar. Boss savaşlarını hiç beğenmedim. Bir önceki souls oyunum Thymesia'nın fersah fersah gerisinde bu anlamda.

I would add another issue:  this game for me crashed quite a bit in the later game locations.))  REVIEW:   This game is hard to review. I love Action RPGs, and this studio's last title, Greedfall, was alright and had some interesting ideas, particularly with the setting and basic story. And that might be Steelrising's best aspect- the setting is a really nice looking revolution era France instead of the typical dark fantasy of similar games. The combat and builds are alright, but had all the flow of Dark Souls 2 (and even has the two-tiers for healing items). This was good for me, as that is the only Dark Souls game I've managed to finish so far. Still, it's really rough around the edges, and the side missions were mostly bland and were piled on at a certain point before the late game rather than more evenly placed throughout (or they would be available but you couldn't advance them until you advanced the main game when it returns to that location anyway).

Lost Ark,1599340,Sanastusa,"Demons are invading your world of Arkesia. Cities and settlements being destroyed and countless deaths. They are searching for hidden relics of the past called Arks. Arks are the only thing with the power to defeat the darkness and bring balance to Arkesia. Hired as a bodyguard for a group of treasure hunters, you stumble your way into fate’s hands. Are you the hero who can find the lost arks?
A free-to-play massively multiplayer online action role playing game (MMOARPG) that released in the east in 2019. Through a partnership with developers and Amazon, a western release was put into the works and came out last month with a huge success.
To start because it will be brought up to anyone who talks about Lost Ark. If it's free-to-play, does that mean it's pay-to-win? In short, Yes. If you are the type of gamer who wants to just throw your credit card on a game to rush to the end content, you can do that. But that will not take away the enjoyment **** for others who choose to play without dropping loads of cash.
With the build up to the launch of Lost Ark, I ignored the hype because I didn’t think it would interest me. Knowing most free to play games offer a little enjoyment but quickly fall off for other games. The day of launch I watched a couple streamers play the game and after a couple hours of background watching I figured I would tip the toe into the water…not knowing I would be **** in and loving every minute.
I describe Lost Ark as a melting pot. It takes game themes from across the field and implements them in a great way all into one game. The story is good and captivating through Arkesia. Big cinematic events happening through the quest lines of different lands. The world is beautiful and a treat to explore by land or sea.
In combat you will easily be swarmed by monsters and feel the legion breathing down your neck but your skill set of flashy (anime-esque/diablo) moves will make you feel like an unstoppable badass. Blood and gore splattering across the detailed environments while you collect your loot.
You want Monster Hunter? They have Guardian Raids. Solo or a party of 4 can take on a variety of difficult guardians that limit normal functions in the game. Limited amount of revives/items while also adding in a time constraint to push your team. Too many mistakes with accidental deaths and it’s a failure.
Do you want challenging content? Abyssal dungeons/raids that focus more on a boss's mechanics than standing around swinging a sword aimlessly. For example the second dungeon has a necromancer and if you fail to collect the correct orbs, he will revive and receive an increase to his abilities making the fighter harder and harder. Kill him all you want, but if you can't communicate or understand a fight, you won’t survive.
You want to make multiple characters because of all the neat classes? Lost Ark is extremely alt friendly. Separate from character level there is an accumulated roster level for your account. Most rewards will be gained on one character but forever shared with your roster. It's even designed for alternate characters to do daily or basic activities to funnel materials to your main character for vertical progression of gear.
You want to fight other players? It has PVP combat that is designed to equalize gear and abilities when you enter into the arena. To balance players on a similar battlefield giving anyone a fighting chance.
On the other spectrum of horizontal content, there is an abundance. Varies collection systems with separate reward tracks to keep any completionist busy. A card system that captures the feeling of opening random packs in a real life trading card game. I get side tracked more with horizontal systems. I forget I need to improve my gear and advance through the story. It's rare for a game to nail that to such a degree.
The game isn't perfect by any definition. It has small flaws depending on the type of gamer you see yourself as. If racing to the end game is your cup of tea it will be a long process because upgrading your gear is a grind. Coming into the game new with no understanding of the systems is overwhelming. These systems came out slowly in Korea over the games development and with the western release we received them all at once. A little bit of reading or youtube videos can help give you the fundamentals of how the systems work.
For what the game has delivered, I am hooked. I'm close to reaching over 200 hours with the game only being out for a little over a month. I'm in for the long haul and excited to see more classes and cosmetics to be released into the game. I still have story quests to work through and the collections are keeping me itching to find the next hidden seed of Arkesia.

Dota 2,570,LT_Gruber,"Great game, but too hard and chaotic for me.

I liked Dota 2. It’s mechanics, variation and tension is a unique concept and I enjoyed it very much. I especially liked it’s balance.

In Dota 2, two teams, each up to 10 players, battle it out on a map. Their goal is to destroy the “Ancient” of the other team. This is a large, bulky structure. Each team can choose their own unique hero, 4 skills and choose if they want to play a support character or an attack character.

The attack character specializes in damage and destruction, while the support character focusses on healing, buffs and utilizations. At the start of each match, a little time is given to the players in the team to discuss tactics.

Along the way to the enemy base, various monsters spawn on the road. This monsters do not attack until you do first. They drop currency, which a player can use to buy items in the various little shops around the map. There are also some boss monsters, which drop special items, some of which can increase damage, allow a resurrection and much more.

The graphics in Dota 2 are nice and colorful. The environments on the maps are detailed and full of life and although simple, it has a certain charm. The only problem for me with the graphics, are the various effects of magic, explosions, hits, elemental attacks that blast in your screen during heavy combat, making me lose overview of the situation sometimes.

The sound and ambient music is great and adds to the experience. When **** hits the fan, it can be a little chaotic, but overall, nothing to complain here.

The mechanics, menu’s and action bars are a little confusing and need some time to get used to. The learning curve is a little steep here, and some training matches are certainly recommended. The way the game is supposed to be played (with the right tactics that is), takes even longer and in the beginning, many noob mistakes will be made. Certain items are used in the wrong moment, certain skills have been used too early, that kind of stuff.

Like mentioned, the best part of Dota 2, is its balance. Every player has equal chance of winning. If a player is stronger than you, or kills you with two hits, it is probably because they risked their lives while getting some unique items from monsters on the road. The magic attacks drain mana, which recharges over time. This way, the game prevents spamming the same attack multiple times, keeping it fair.

I liked Dota 2 and it’s mechanics a lot better than League of Legends. There is more balanced gameplay, more tactics (in my opinion) and, because you play in teams, there is more coordination and teamwork.

The only problem, and reason, I stopped playing, is (once again) my lack of skill with this kinds of games. I do like them, and surely want to try them out, however, this kind of intense, fast and “professional” games are not for some hours of relaxation. So in the end, I just cherished the few happy memories I had with this game and moved on.

In terms of gameplay, mechanics and overall feel however, I would certainly recommend this game.",8,True,"Jan 12, 2024"

Now Dota 2 is no longer Dota. All competitive factors are lost and its greatness is lost due to greed. Small example; player HUD used to be same size for all heroes, now it changes from hero to hero covering more or less screen space thus making it unequal.

Best modern ARPG for **** a constructive criticism I would say there is a bit of bloat related to game mechanics, it has accumulated over the years. This might scare new players and tire old veterans sometimes. But Path of Exile is still the most enjoyable experience I've ever had in an ARPG. Many of the mechanics are not needed to enjoy the game and it can be played casually or in a very very hardcore way. If you are going to try PoE for the first time or want to return to it and give it another try, just take your time and do what you find interesting it's going to be enjoyable no matter how deep you want to delve into it.
PoE is the true Diablo 2 successor.",10,True,"Aug 28, 2024"
Path of Exile,238960,CnPx98,"1, if not the best ARPG around today. And it's free, with no P2W Micro-transactions. Path of Exile (POE) is such an awesome experience that is difficult to pull yourself away from, after getting hooked. Every last detail has been thought out. Even those smallest quality of life improvements, that normally get glossed over, have been solved in a way that make the user experience better. Then all of these little improvements together, just make the game feel so natural and smooth to play. 
So the best part of ARPGs is the character building freedom, and that is where POE really stands out from the croud. The developers at Grinding Gear Games have really made every single style feel like the possibilties are endless. This has came at the cost of the new player experience feeling overwhelming. So if you are new, I recommend copying someone else's build for your first character. This will allow you to become familier with the massive skill tree before tackling your own build.
Campaign wise the game is fairly sized. How ever I personally never took much interest in the story and lore. But the gameplay is so good that it didn't bother me that I didn't have a clue what was going on. I have heard from fans that the story is really good if you bother to learn it. But my ADHD doesn't allow me to listen to a voice over the top of a text dump for each part of the game narration. Its like Audible but your looking at a screen with nothing intersting going on.
The enemy and boss mechanics are the best you can experience in ARPGs. With enemy attacks being well telegraphed. At times can be quite fast paced. With all sorts of flashing effects that gives you that sweet, sweet dopamine. 
The looting is also fun. Something that Diablo hasn't been able to quite capture since D2. POE makes you feel like no time is ever wasted. The currencies in this game are items to which do various things. Like change item modifiers or gem slots. So even items you don't want can be exchanged to NPCs for some of these currencies. Making everything carry atleast some form of value to the player. Rather then having 1 universal currency, that you end up getting so much of that it ends worthless. 
There is a player trading system. Most people tend to want Chromatic Orbs for items. These orbs changing the colour of gem slots on items. Gem slots are what grant you your abilities which you use in combat.

POE being free. Whats its monitization like? The only thing that you can buy that alters gameplay is stash tabs. These cost around $5 each. There is a variety of different kinds. Other then a currency tab (Allowing you to stack each currency, way higher), you don't really need any of the others, but they are nice to have. You could easily play through the game and get the full experience without dropping a dime. But I personally recommend spending around $20 on a few stash tabs so you don't spend as much time micromanaging your bank.

My 1 gripe with this game. ADD LEG ARMOUR!! All the characters walk around almost half naked. You do get full armour later in the game. But for hours you will be walking around in near enough your underwear, from the waist down. You can get cosmetic overrides, thou. Changing how each slot appears, regardless of what you have equipped. These are on the prices side, I think each bundle is like $30 or something. They do have discount sales on for a selection of stuff. It's more there if you want to show extra support to the team and get a little something in return. It's not ever rammed in your face. Throughout your hole time with the game, you will never get ads pop up asking you to spend money. Only a small button saying ""shop"" which clearly states that it is a microtransaction shop. So you know, this is where you spend real money. 

POE is proof that you don't need malicious or deceptive techniques to be a successful FTP game. You just need to make the experience enjoyable and the money will come. That when developers do these annoying FOMO techniques, that it is out of greed and not because ""They need to or the game will die"". 

If you enjoy ARPGs with fun looting and unlimited character builds then POE is definitely a game for you. And its free so definitely give it a go! The new player experience does have a bit of a learning curve, but I highly recommend sitting through it because once you start getting hooked, you won't regret it.",9,True,"Aug 13, 2024"

After trying for a few days, I’ve had enough. My previous comments were already polite, but now I have to tell it like it is. First of all, not only does the game completely fail to responsibly teach the mechanics, but the company behind it is utterly **** entire game is designed to work against the player. The map mods always target the players’ weaknesses (and they dare to call this a sense of achievement—it's an insult to the players!). There's a 10% experience penalty, only five portals, and the skill tree, which seems expansive at first glance, is a total lie. Skill Gems? Whether they're usable or not entirely depends on the developers’ whims!This garbage game is as repulsive as Blizzard. With a company like this, I seriously doubt that their upcoming PoE2 will be good game.

Overall, the game cannot be considered poor; however, it is undeniably frustrating and infuriating.First, the game features a highly complex system. Unfortunately, many explanations of the game mechanics are provided through player-created websites, such as those detailing skill trees and equipment crafting, rather than being offered directly by the developers. The developers should have provided instructional resources to guide players on crafting equipment and understanding skill trees and their combinations. Instead, the official game website remains unchanged and simplistic, while the game’s mechanics continue to grow increasingly complex. Consequently, only players with an in-depth understanding of the game’s mechanics and calculations are able to excel, leaving newcomers at a loss, forced to rely on **** game’s content is inherently challenging, and with experience penalties upon character death and limitations on late-game map access. new players have no choice but to depend on player-created websites for game information. Unfortunately, these sites often lack the latest updates and sometimes contain outdated information. For an internationally promoted game, the language barrier further exacerbates the issue, making it even more difficult for new and returning players to access comprehensive game information and mechanics. These are aspects that the game developers should have addressed, but they have yet to take any action in this regard.finally, I think this game company is most likely to be of the same nature as Blizzard, so don’t have high expectations.Finally, regarding the experience penalty and my personal feeling, when the character is about to level up by the amount of experience (approximate experience: 50% or more), there will always be monsters that can kill the character immediately in the map, this phenomenon will always occur regardless of the difficulty of the map, and then 10% of the experience points that have been worked hard to increase are forcibly deducted, and all the time invested is wasted in this phenomenon.",1,False,"Sep 9, 2024"
Path of Exile,238960,VanVilon,"I recently started playing the new season of Path of Exile on July 26th and was enjoying the game. I was so excited that I immediately purchased the most expensive supporter pack, spending $90 to support the developers. However, just a few hours later, I was suddenly banned for “3rd party software” (botting). The only other applications I had running were Riot’s client and the Mobalitics app on Overwolf. Neither of these interacted with Path of Exile or made any changes to the **** a complete beginner, I was simply following a leveling guide from Maxroll, trying to learn the game. Despite this, I was banned without any explanation or investigation. The support team refused to look into my gameplay to verify if the ban was justified and only responded with pre-generated, copy-pasted answers. The ban is permanent.

I am not alone in this experience—many others have been banned for no apparent reason:

I am sharing this to warn everyone to be extremely cautious about purchasing any microtransactions from this company. They can revoke your access to the game at any time and for any reason, as outlined in their policy rules. You could be banned for simply having unrelated applications running in the background, even if they have nothing to do with your Path of Exile gameplay.",0,False,"Jul 31, 2024"
