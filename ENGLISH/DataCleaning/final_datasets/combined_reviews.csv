I have played this game for over 700 hours now and i must say it is one of the best zombie survival ames out there in my oppinion there is nothing out there that has the same feel as this game, the progressio is great and the building aspect is wonderfull. It has a steep learning curve when you start the game fresh and don't know what you are doing, but give it time and it will grow on you.
It's a voxel game so everything is a block that can be destroyed but can also be exploited.

7 Days to Die,251570,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",76561198021512230,"Pros

- Large, interesting world with lots of towns, POIs, and places to explore.
- Combat and gunplay feel much better than the older alphas.
- Graphics and lighting are noticeably improved, especially in newer versions.
- Quests give structured gameplay for people who prefer constant action and looting.
- Multiplayer groups progress quickly through missions, loot, and XP.
- Plenty of content for looter-focused players, including weapons, mods, and POI variety.

Cons

- Base building lost most of its creativity:
   - zombie go straight for the weakest block. 
   - removed tons of building options.
   - more below.
- Skill system replaced active progression with a perk system and magazine RNG that feels generic and punishes base building.
- Game heavily favors quest grinding, leaving builders and slow-paced players under-leveled.
- Zombie pathing targets weak blocks like a laser, removing fun or experimental base layouts.
- Farming and water systems feel downgraded, slower, and more annoying than older versions.
- Long-standing bugs (hitbox issues, zombie spawns in sealed areas, vehicles glitching out) remain decade-old problems.
- Shift away from survival and building toward a faster, looter-shooter loop that many older fans don’t enjoy.

Overall: it's probably a fun game for new players.  I'm sure if I played this now without ever having experienced how good the old game was, I'd love it.  Now, it's just a generic looter-shooter to get the largest audience.  It's sad how the devs tinkering took tons of the greatest parts out of the game. 

Longer and more descriptive review:

I've been playing this game on and off since 2016.  It used to be my absolute favorite game with great building, a pretty good balance between exploration and base building, interesting mechanics with biomes, good crafting, and most importantly a very exciting and terrifying experience.  

The #1 downfall to this game and the worst part of it is that the developers CONSTANTLY change the game. Since I've been playing they've had 9 major updates that completely reworked dozens of parts of the game, usually for the worse.  If you like base building don't bother with this game anymore, they've taken out 90% of the creativity and 100% punishes you for building a base now.  

I LOVE base building and this game used to be amazing for it, the skill system actually rewarded you with a skills-based progression system but they changed that to the most generic and useless attribute/perk system with RNG books and magazines you need to find to unlock skills and traits. The old system was the type of active-use progression where if you dig, you improve your digging skill, you craft, you increase crafting skill.  

The game actively punishes you now for being a base builder.  If you play with people who do the generic trader missions or explore, they level up ten times as fast, find all the magazines and books, and then can put attributes into everything whether they use it or not.  It's so disappointing because good and fun base building takes time but now you're funneled into a looter shooter type game and punished if you build. 

They've also taken out tons of building options and changed the way hordes attack. There used to be a lot more variation in building options, building styles, and general base development.  Now the AI is pathed to the weakest points, they dig directly to the weakest tile like guided missiles, farming and other collectors like water have been replaced with poor mechanics that don't really work but still attract zombies like nothing else.  

It's all clearly to shift the game from a base building survival game to the generic skins-purchasing looter shooter, generic zombie game which can reach the broadest audiences, which has obviously worked so good for them.  

This isn't even getting into all the other bugs and problems they've never fixed or added in their constant reworks of the game.  They still have random zombie spawns in places they shouldn't be able to spawn, vehicles are a wild ride, there is still a weird lag on melee and zombie hit boxes that they've never bothered dealing with in over 10 years (one of the reasons why I prefer base building).",False,1,0,1763809939,N/A,Steam

Its a... slow game when its not crashing, with progression made difficult by the instability since at any moment it could crash forcing you to remain in places that are as safe as possible.",False,1,0,1763667579,N/A,Steam

There's some depth to the production chains and tech tree but the military gameplay loop is pretty basic. Early game food production is a bottleneck. Late game the raiders are overpowered.

Overall it's a decent game with both easy and challenging map biomes and gameplay modes. There's some flexibility to city layout but there's certain production chains that work better when placed in a more formulaic structure, so the city building part is kind of repetitive after a couple of play throughs. The strategic combat portion of the game is very basic and repetitive after the first five raids.

The devs have hinted at future updates and possibly DLCs if the game sells well so hopefully they continue to expand on the core gameplay loops like they did during early access.

It's like a more polished version of banished with basic RTS combat added. There's at least 30-50 hours of play here minimum. More if you enjoy city building with some environmental interruptions and the occasional raider incursion.

Combat sucks, trade hub no auto trade or Search.   basically the menus need work.  As a gamer, im not going to lean into trade, until im self seficient,  and if you wanna support the town, you need to do this, till like tier 3.

Farming sucks, interesting idea, but too much micro management, Still aint figured out what sand and clay do..

***My 70 hour city where I unlocked everything, maxed out the tech tree, and was basically just constantly taunting raiders, was magically erased from my ""saved games""... started 1 new city after writing my initial review which was overwhelmingly positive; put about 35 hours into it, & my son asked me to see my previous, well-developed city, and to my surprise when I went to load it, it simply didn't exist anymore. Only a slew of auto-saves of my current city. It had its own name, I never interacted with or deleted anything at all. But my 70 hour investment doesn't exist anymore & I now have absolutely zero desire to play this game again. For those that do, please be careful with your save files. Absolutely crushing loss, as silly as it seems...***

I started a fresh new settlement about 5 times back to back before feeling like I had a decent enough foot-hold & understanding of the game & its mechanics to progress into the later tiers of the game. Now 66 hours in, with probably 58-60 of those hours dedicated to a single settlement; I would say, this game is amazing, & consistently leaves me wanting more. After building all 3 civic monuments(you ""win"" after building just one), I am only left wanting more, & feeling like I've only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.

**Key points**

- The economy management & trading is, for me, supremely enjoyable. As your settlement & population scales up, it becomes more challenging to continue ""out-producing"" the demand of your buildings & settlers in order to have surplus goods available for trading with the traveling merchants at your trading post; requiring attentive oversight of how much labor you invest into producing whatever goods you want to produce. Some items/goods come very easily, others take tremendous time. For example, platemail armor seems to be the most valuable individual item that a settlement can generate, typically valued between 800-1000 gold for a single unit. But the time it takes to generate even a single platemail is literal in-game years. And if you have heavy soldiers, they will automatically seek/equip them from storage. So generating a surplus to cash in on is very difficult & time consuming. However, you can also grow grain to your hearts desire to either stockpile, or mill into flour; with a huge host of options in between. The game has a long list of goods/items that are ALL used by your settlers & buildings as you play, & trackable in-game by you as the goods move from person to person/building to building. 

- The time investment relative to progress. I read several other reviews that criticize the game speed & the fact that ""max speed"" is a 3x multiplier of normal in game speed which is admittedly slow, but revealed itself necessary. While in the very early to early/mid-game(tier 1/tier 2), the game can feel like a crawl, & like you WISH there is a 5x or 10x option to build resources. But as I progressed & as the settlement became much more complex, I found myself slowing down to 1x speed, if not pausing outright, to micro individual things, especially trading and inventory management AT the trading post. Also, when a combat alert happens, you want to slow down to properly arrange your troops to defend. Enemies can approach rather quickly at 3x. I initially found myself wanting more of a fast-forward function, but rapidly outgrew that thought & found the 3x speed option to be more than sufficient as my settlement grew, & as I invested more of my time into a settlement. My time investment ultimately had me appreciate the fact that the game caps at 3x.

- Aesthetics. The game & specifically the architecture evolution look outstanding. Each & every time I built something new, or watched a building upgrade to its next tier, I was pleased & proud.

- Difficulty. My main settlement is played on whatever normal/default is. & while there are minor tips & tutorials that pop up to assist you, the game leaves much to be discovered through trial and error, & i am the type of gamer to very much appreciate that. I don't want my hand held on how to be successful in a game like this, & i've found the difficulty curve to be very rewarding. Figuring out why production is off, or why you're running short on a particular good, or short on labor/builders & rectifying that problem is challenging & fulfilling.

66 hours in, I cant say I have individual complaints. The game has been overwhelmingly enjoyable, & whatever problems/complaints I ""thought"" I had at individual points in the early game, revealed themselves to be manageable, & merely requiring experience.

All that said, this game has a moderately low floor for entry, but an absolutely Massive ceiling of potential that will take hundreds if not thousands of hours to master. Huge shout out to the devs for creating this GEM of a game.",False,0,0,1763169211,N/A,Steam

Town defense is garbage.  You can't place archers on walls, so they just try to fire through gates until they get over run, or worse try to fight close quarters.  The towers do less damage than a hunter, they're really just more of a distraction until other troops get there.

A lot of the industry and resource gathering needs pretty severe reworking.  Getting industry to the point that you can either turn a profit or even maintain demand is nearly impossible.

You are constantly out of food.  The amount of people needed to make food grows to the point that it's the only thing you can do.

I do not understand how a group of aspiring settlers have absolutely no experience in farming, mining and animal husbandry. Why the F would they try to start a town (starving or not) if they cannot sustain it? They brought people who can do the complicated process of the tannery and soap making but no one who deals with food provision?

""right hans we have everyone here to start a new town, soap makers, basket makers and shoe makers"" 

""Ok stuart, what about food though? should we take people who know how to do animal husbandry""

""Na hans, we will suss that out through a ridiculously slow process of building research points so while we make mountains of soap bars and shoes we can all slowly starve to death""

For me it would have made more sense to have these capabilities already unlocked as a foundation and your research points can be spent on skill levels of the specific task. Not sure what has happened to the growth mechanic as barely any new settlers come. TBH its no wonder no one new arrives as the first lot that left to start a new town haven't got a clue what they are doing and are probably presumed dead.

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198013058648,"This game is fine, but there's a caveat there based on what you want out of it. 

So far as city building and citizen management goes this game is decent. Nothing exceptional but everything more or less works the way you think it should and it's not too much hassle. There is a decent tech tree but it takes an absurd amount of time to get all of the perks if you want them, despite the fact that It has a very Banished feel to it and you can make extremely nice/authentic looking villages if that's your jam. 8/10. 

The thing I was most excited about, which most city builders do not incorporate, is RTS mechanics. Every few years bandits will raid your city and you have to defend it. You have an okay amount of troop options and walls/towers to use. Again, nothing special, but the RTS mechanics also very clearly not the focus of this game. Which is the problem. The difficulty in defending your base isn't actually the invading forces, the difficulty is in micromanaging your troops/villagers. This game has beyond abysmal micro. Getting your archers to stand still and shoot is borderline impossible unless you're willing to individually tell each archer exactly which enemy to shoot and when. Infantry spend most of their time getting stuck on each other. When they're not stuck on each other they're following enemies around instead of attacking. The attack move command doesn't work the way you would expect attack move to work if you've ever played an RTS before. Your archers are going to run into melee range and your infantry are going to run past enemies. Not sure what kind of clown programmed the RTS mechanics into this game but they're beyond infuriating to use. 0/10. 

I played this game for 20-something hours years ago when I bought it on early access. The game has come a long way since then with it's official release. But the military side of the game is almost unplayable for me.

The pacing could be a bit faster, lacks a bit of QoL (it's tedious to re-arrange a base), doesn't really discuss mechanics (not even in their website), there are some strange quirks (farmers from far away keep travelling between crop lots), lacks options in logistics management and clarity of which goes where and how does inventory flow across the town, doesn't discuss the production rate of buildings, bugs (flag doesn't re-appear when a barracks is destroyed). Trading becomes stagnant after awhile, you just wait for the rng and check what the merchant buys or sells. Economy mechanics where there is no true way to make a sustainable economy with large surpluses passively. No passive trading functionality (you have to micromanage every sale and re-stock?)

I  bought the game a couple years ago thought it had promise but needed a better tutorial/encyclopedia as well as more polish.  I checked in here and there and found the picture to be largely the same.  The full release looks pretty much identical to what we had a few weeks ago.  There clearly are a lot of systems.  There are many resource types.   Village development looks promising.   But, stuff is hard to see and some of the mechanics are obscure; it is easy to sink an hour only to find there would have been only one way to proceed in the beginning lest your folks stave or die of cold.  So, perhaps less freedom and a bit more hand holding in the beginning?  Given that I have a life and a family and don't game every day, a disappointing evening is enough to turn me off for months.  10 years ago, when there were not many games in the genre (I also had not reproduced and had a much less demanding job), I would have felt compelled to figure it all out.  Now, I can think of at least 5 similar games off the top of my head and they are not the same of course but are infinitely easier to get into for playing a couple hours here and there.  

As a side note, games take a long time to develop and FF did look incredibly good when it came out in EA.  Now, the visuals are better than average but not by any means jaw dropping.  Furthermore, there are now a few gridless games with organic road placement and going back to square grids and deliberately building dirt roads does not feel good; grids are an artifact of game coding, not medieval village development.  Dirt roads just happen over time.  I want messy and organic, not neatly tied to a square grid with 90-deg turns.  I did not expect the devs to change their whole game to come up to speed on this so it did not figure into the yea or nay decision.

Feels like it didn't make the jump from early access (tech demo) to a full game.

I don't get the hype.
Played quite a while, but never felt any connection to the game.

IMHO the game lacks soul. Yes, there are a few interesting mechanics, but they don't really go anywhere.
Micromanaging your gatherers in the first few years - nice. Doing it in year 20 (or... not doing it) - why?
Same with farms - it's a nice idea to have crop rotation, but the way it is done feels like a minipuzzle game.
Techtree is completly random - it's just after some time: ""here's a techpoint""-> click something -> something is 10% better or ""here is a new building"" -> ""yeah, i have a new building, because i clicked on someting""

And while you might say: at least some new mechanics -> the rest is nothing new and you have all seen it better done. None of the buildings/workcycles are animated. The buildings have some moving parts and people stand around and do the same movement the whole time - the only thing that visually changes is the amount of produce in the storage. This has been done better 20 years ago. Not even the transports are visible - people just go around empty handed and ... 10 wood delivered to building site (there is some hint of it with the baskets and carts, but it just doesn't come to life for me).

You could say, that's not important, as long as the gameplay is good - but there is none. Building a busy town is the game - that town looks busy but taking a closer look, it's just people walking or standing around doing unconnected animations.

(For clarification: take the brickyard: you see the forms for the bricks, you see bricks layed out for drying, you see the ovens and the pile of done bricks - nobody ever moves anything. nobody uses the forms for the bricks, nobody lays them out to dry, noone puts them in the oven or takes them out - all they do is sit in front of the oven with some stick and then the pile behind them gets bigger.)

Music is good but very repetitive.
Menues are bad .... it is a city builder - why is the build menue full of submenues? instead of beeing spread on the bottom of the screen, like every(!) other city builder does it (ok - do it differently, but why do it worse? - feels like ""building is just a small part of the gameplay"" ... well... then where is the rest?)

That's basically how I feel about it - either there are major parts missing or - if what is there should be all - it's by far not good enough (because it has been done better over and over by others and the devs should and could have done their research).

I guess the replayability felt bit low for me, but maybe it's just my gaming style.

The threat is always external (invading barbarians, barbarian camps, wild animals) - there are no other kingdoms to worry about or to do some diplomacy with.

It felt like some medieval life elements were missing in order to give this game a bit more... Flair. Such as the ability to have a monarch, a castle, guards with the house colors, maybe some crime as the population is unhappy or hungry...

They ignored all feedback and criticism regarding this for over 3 years and released the game to 1.0 with the tool in the same state as it was when they released to early access. Why is the terrain tool such a big issue you may wonder resulting in my negative review and inability to enjoy the game?

Buildings and paths follow the terrain so if you place a building on uneven terrain, it is wonky. This is especially noticeable for the larger buildings. The last time I played the game on a mountain map, my mind broke as I realised my entire Town was completely wonky made worse and more noticeable with the larger buildings and upgrades to housing.

The other issue is that any ranged buildings and units get a bonus to their damage depending on the terrain height relative to their target. This means that to create proper defences, you have this incredibly tedious, unintuitive and somewhat broken tool to try and adjust the terrain heights. It's abysmal and ruins the entire game to the point that most people don't even bother playing on maps that have hills or mountains because they do not want to have to deal with this issue.

I thought these devs would be good because they made Grim Dawn, but I was so wrong. How can you ignore so many complaints about the terrain tool and not do anything to rectify it?

Anger Foot,2198510,29.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",76561198023266414,"Update 23 November 2025:
You know what, I know when to eat my words.  Like a week after I wrote my ""this is abandonware"" review, they released a major update.  I guess all the people who said ""negative reviewers are morons, everything is fine"" are probably feeling pretty vindicated right now.  But I'm not taking back what I said about 16 months of crickets being ""not normal,"" even if the people who called us morons were right.  A lot of EA games get quietly ditched in less than 16 months, so it's not like there wasn't some precedent here.

That being said, I put in 56 hours on the previous version and had fun.  I haven't played the new update yet, but the last version (16 months ago) was pretty fun and I enjoyed it, so I imagine the update only made it better.  For $30, it's not a bad value - I've paid way more for AAA games that I finished playing in way less time, so this is a pretty good value for the amount of game time you get.  I changed my review to positive, since it's still an active game.

***************

I really enjoyed this game while it lasted. Exhibit A: I put 56 hours of played time into it, because it was fun, until you basically ran out of things to do.  For the $30 or so that I paid, I got a decent amount of play time.  I've paid way more for AAA games that I finished playing in way less time, so the value isn't bad.  And New Cycle isn't even that buggy for an EA game.

If you're okay with putting down $30 for a few dozen fun hours of a well thought-out game, have at it.  But if you're expecting the rest of the roadmap to be completed sometime this century... don't hold your breath - you might suffocate.

The last substantive update (aka something that changed the playable code) was in July of 2024.  Everything since then has just been puff pieces and pretty posters of ""things that are being worked on."" And even the last of those was about 9 months ago.

And for those people who say ""negative reviewers are morons, everything is fine""... I refer you to Kerbal Space Program 2, which went through this exact cycle (no pun intended).  The developer stopped updating the game.  Then marketing took over and tried to hide that.  They even posted a ""thanks for hanging out, look at everything we accomplished so far!"" right before the game got abandoned.  Then the publisher fired the entire studio and refused to ever confirm or deny that it had been abandoned - they just quietly walked away even as the community cried about it.

I enjoyed the game while it lasted, I really did.  I'm honestly more mad at people who are still defending the nothing that's happened for the last 16 months and thinking this is normal.  Look at any normal job - if you keep telling your boss that you're working for 16 months, eventually he's going to find out that you haven't actually done anything for 16 months.

It's up to you - if you close your eyes and pretend you're buying a finished game, it's not a bad value.  But you can't ever really ""win"" because that part never got written in.  I can't recommend a game that'll never finish its roadmap.

What I do know is that I the game is overall enjoyable to play, albeit rough around the edges and if that's what you like then give it a shot.

After reading some of the reviews if the developer would have probably communicated Maybe would not have such negative reviews. I complain about Early Access as well but to me it's like a full release. I have a 4K system It had zero problems no issues none ran smoothly no hesitation. I really had nothing bad to say about the game. It's a city builder. I like the way everything intertwines. 

The research tree is very large and very dependent upon what you are doing. You can't progress without it most definitely. Some city builders require buildings to be next to each other or in the area close together to process items but not this game You don't have to have buildings right next to each other They really don't depend on each other that way which was different. 

I love that I can send out scouts and reveal the map. In order for some of that to even function properly I had to do research to a certain point which I was very far away from some of it and had a long ways to go to even get to that point, which I found to be fascinating. I had more work to do just to accomplish things that were being revealed on the map.

Firstly, this game is obviously NOT a cash-grab. No Developer puts this many years into creating a new IP of this scope and quality with all the accompanying social media channels if they are just trying to make a quick buck. Also, if the negative reviewers bothered to check the discord discussions, they would learn that the game has not been abandoned. Having said that, the only way any Developer stays in business is by generating enough revenue to keep the lights on so I genuinely hope this game succeeds because even as the negative reviewers admit, the Developers have created a solid foundation for a great game.   

To give some context, I purchased this game last year on the same day that I purchased Manor Lords. After testing both games, I refunded Manor Lords and kept New Cycle, not because Manor Lords was a bad game, but because New Cycle was the more polished game - it looked better, sounded better, and had far fewer bugs and mechanical problems. I plan to get Manor Lords once it is in better shape but people need to show patience for early access games like Manor Lords AND New Cycle that have small development teams.

It is a punishing, deeply challenging survival builder that will test your patience and resolve. If you're looking for a gentle, hand-holding experience, this isn't it. But if you're a fan of games like Frostpunk or Rimworld and crave a truly brutal, unforgiving challenge, then you've found your next obsession.

The core gameplay loop is incredibly tough. You are thrown into an apocalyptic world with very little guidance, and the early game is a constant struggle. The first few cycles are a desperate scramble for resources, and you will fail. A lot. But every failure is a lesson. And when you finally manage to survive and thrive, the sense of accomplishment is unlike anything else.

The game's music and art style are fantastic and perfectly capture the bleak atmosphere. However, the background music can become repetitive, and the menu audio cues are sometimes inconsistent, which can break the immersion.

Game’s got that classic city builder addiction loop, but with survival stress sprinkled in. Imagine Banished had a love child with Frostpunk, and then it watched Mad Max for parenting tips. Yeah, it’s kinda like that.

The good:
✅ Building from sticks and stones to smokestacks and steel feels chef’s kiss
✅ The post-apocalyptic vibe actually makes sense and adds pressure
✅ Managing resources and trying not to starve your entire population = true strategy gamer moment™

The mid:
⚖️ UI’s doing its job but not winning any awards
⚖️ Tutorial? Nah, figure it out like the rest of us, champ 💀
⚖️ Sometimes you stare at your screen for 10 minutes thinking “what now?” but in a good existential way

The not-so-good:
❌ Game stutters a bit once your city turns into a spaghetti mess
❌ Some features feel half-baked (early access vibes, y’know)

This game reminds me of two classics in said genre - Frostpunk and Anno, and I think this game doing a good work combining mechanics from both of them. The start is smooth and surprisingly, not overwhelming, considering amount of resources available, but they introduced and used gradually, without creating a situations when bunch of them being dropped into your attention zone in the same time. The game is also not without challenge, the further you develop - the more interconected resources and buildings become, and don`t forget that you need not to forget to manage constantly growing needs of your setlers (if you want said buildings to work of course :))

I`m sure devs can make this game even more exciting in the future updates, and with that in mind, maybe in 10 years we will treat this game as one of those classics in genre, and rightfully so",True,8,0,1755982807,N/A,Steam

It has a  lot of layers and interesting things to do, blending city builder with survival mechanics, however there are some areas that need improvement

At first, I found the UI overwhelming and the controls a bit confusing, but the tutorial helps a lot and makes it easier to understand the core systems. Once you get into it, the game becomes really enjoyable.

My main issue is the pacing,it moves too fast between cycles, and there's often too much happening at once. Also, the population system feels unbalanced, with low birth rates and limited ways to recover when workers die.

That said, the game has great potential. It’s already fun for fans of complex city builders and I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves with future updates.

The setup is classic, with humanity clawing back from collapse and you taking responsibility for organizing the first sparks of civilization, where every decision matters.

The opening focuses on survival by securing food, wood, and housing while constantly juggling limited workers between gathering and construction. On normal mode, the difficulty feels fair because mistakes such as expanding housing too quickly before stabilizing food supplies are noticeable but not devastating.

The atmosphere stands out as one of the strongest elements. The bleak post-apocalyptic setting and detailed visuals make it rewarding to watch a small camp slowly grow into a functioning village. Some mechanics feel unclear at first, and the resource loop can become repetitive as you shift workers around to keep production moving.

Unexpected events also keep things interesting, like when a worker at the soup kitchen died in a fire, forcing you to adapt quickly. Compared to easy mode, normal is far more engaging. On easy, resources are abundant, setbacks are mild, and events rarely disrupt your plans, so the challenge and tension are almost absent. I would recommend playing on normal since it strikes a better balance between survival pressure and steady progress, making victories feel earned rather than handed to you.

Still, the game would feel smoother if the population were not so demanding. Right now, everyone seems to want something different at the same time: one person asks for a shack, another demands better health care, and someone else expects improved worker morale. Meeting all of these requests in the same time frame feels overwhelming and at times unrealistic, which makes progression more frustrating than it needs to be.

It feels more like a calm city-builder than a survival challenge, and I even managed to survive four in-game years without losing anyone, with the only deaths coming from old age rather than sickness or disaster.

The only drawback is the camera movement, which feels a bit locked since you can’t rotate it with a simple right click like in most city-building games, making navigation feel clunky at times.

I enjoyed learning how to play and the concept is really solid. I really like the world map and Explorer building, it feels like a throwback to one of my favourite parts of Frostpunk. However, there are major game breaking bugs that emerge when specific circumstances are met. For example, one of the maps available to play on (there are two currently) has a river, and you can build a bridge across the river to exploit resources on the other side. However, the bridge will never connect to your village's main road which has a major effect on the resource's productivity values. You can also build multiple bridges overtop of that bridge -- it's like the game doesn't detect it. The Tier 3 kitchen is less efficient than the Tier 2 kitchen. With multiple users noting a recent lack of engagement from the devs in the community discussion forums (some claiming abandonware), there is no telling when, or even if, these issues might be fixed.

[list]
    [*] No updates. At the time of writing the game is in EA and the last patch was 13 months ago. Sure, there was a patch on an experimental branch - but it lacks both in quality and quantity, and there was no word from the devs, so the game might not even hit 1.0.
    [*] Horrible visual style. Not in a way that it looks ugly, but in an entirely different way: the buildings not only look so similar that you can barely distinguish them from each other, they somehow manage to blend in with the terrain too, as everything has the exact same dirt brown palette. The fact that minimap does not, for whatever reason, show anything but the terrain makes finding scattered gathering huts basically impossible.
    [*] Poor stat/feedback/UI. Yes, there are a bunch of graphs, but some show useless stuff, some useful stuff is nowhere to be found, most of the menus go for “style over QOL”. There isn’t even a classical Banished work menu for fast job switching - and considering that people here die often and training them for higher tier buildings is completely manual - you will be doing it a lot, manually for every building, wasting time to find where exactly did your worker die.
    [*] Horrible morale/workload system. How it is supposed to work: you make people happy so you can force them to work harder or get other benefits. How it works here: you try to make them work harder - and they are tired in 5 minutes, so you either micromanage like mad for pathetically low bonuses or simply stop interacting with the system as there are no other benefits you can get from it. But wait, that’s not all - for whatever reason every single workload/productivity decision you make uses absolute values instead of percentage. Example: you have an event to give your workers one day off in 10 days and get -20 productivity, so you expect that your worker who contributed 10 points (building has 10 workers max) will now give only 8, right? Wrong, it just means that 3 workers will do the same job as 1. How does one day off in 10 days lead to 66% loss of productivity? I have no clue.
    [*] The whole “story” thing. In Frostpunk you have a steady buildup, you are shown how dangerous the cold is and are told about the big event that will be much, much worse - so you, the player, have a clear goal that you FEEL you need to achieve. In this game though you have a few lines of text about how bad it will be and… Welp, nothing. There are some bad events that are more annoying than threatening or dangerous, and the finale does not feel like a big event you are preparing to - it is just a “welp, the run ended” screen. To put it simply - the survival story is not working due to being poorly written and having no impact on gameplay.
    [*] World map. On paper you can build outposts on the world map to get resources. In practice it comes a bit late in the run and the whole thing feels extremely basic and underdeveloped.
    [*] Technology tree. It is weird - instead of having branches it has tiers, and upgrading a tier does not need the technologies from a lower tier - but it needs several buildings and a certain population number. Yes, I know that the buildings needed do require technologies from that tier - but I had enough cases where I unlocked a building without having its prerequisite in the production chain. So this whole tier system feels like a forced tutorial for every tech level - very weird and inorganic. And at higher levels the prices for each building become so high that it completely kills the pacing as you have to wait way too long to get enough resources to build anything.
    [*] End game techs. To put it simply: when you get to the last tech level upgrading your building gets you zero benefits for insane resource costs. That’s because those buildings are supposed to be hooked to conveyors and highways to work at full efficiency. Sure, when you do that - those buildings will give you really good bonuses. The problem - you will never do that, because up to this point you were building your whole city trying to make it as tight as possible to minimize travel times (even though logistics doesn’t seem to work right now) and get into the radius of service buildings - so you simply do not have any free space to build a surprisingly wide highway or conveyor belts. In theory you can rebuild your whole production, but here comes the next problem:
    [*] Clash of survival and sandbox ideas. Currently most of the gameplay is just a Banished clone - free build sandbox. In that type of game you can switch your laws (btw, apart from events there aren’t even simple laws like population control), rebuild your whole city if it no longer is good enough for you. But at the same time you are playing by survival rules: decisions that you can never change, not having enough time to rebuild even a part of your city - let alone your whole production facility - because you have a ticking timer, strict requirements for resources and efficiency. Sadly those two aspects of the game instead of working together mostly play against each other, that clearly shows that the game needed more time in the oven to decide what it wants to be.
[/list]
So is the game bad? In its current version - yes, it simply isn’t ready - not even for early access. With some mechanics on the lowest functional level and without interaction between systems the game simply has nothing to offer. Survival strategy? Frostpunk. Post-apoc city builder? Endzone. Factory builder? Factorio. Playing 3 of those will give you better experience in their respective field. The game does have good bits (like alternative craft recipes), but they aren’t enough, and considering how slow the development goes - there will be a lot more city builder games before that game is finished, potentially making it obsolete on release date.",False,2,0,1757261271,N/A,Steam

[b]New Cycle[/b] is the typical game with an interesting core concept but poorly executed. It presents itself as a mix between a survival game and a city builder (the factory planning part is negligible, and I’ll explain why later), like the excellent Frostpunk. However, unlike Frostpunk, it fails in both genres, the game puts you in charge of a small group of survivors after a nuclear apocalypse. The world is a nearly barren wasteland and civilization must be rebuilt from scratch or at least that’s how it starts. I won’t spoil anything, but the objective shifts after a few hours, borrowing several mechanics from Frostpunk and throwing them into this big melting pot we call New Cycle.

The events in game, which are clearly trying to imitate Frostpunk’s, have no real catastrophic impact, they apply some negative modifiers, but nothing too dangerous, so most of them can be easily ignored by simply clicking the first choice often without even reading the description.

The game loop is simple and typical of factory builders: most resources are immediately available or at least their locations are making map planning very straightforward, but this is where the factory building elements end. The game allows for building conveyor belts and train lines, but these are not necessary even in the late game, since they’re optional, there’s no real need to carefully plan your industrial layout to boost efficiency, this leaves a lot of freedom, which personally I didn’t enjoy.

Graphically, the game is nice to look at, but many buildings especially in the early stages are made up of tents and tarps, and are hard to tell apart, there is also a system that lets you assign icons to buildings for visibility on the minimap, but annoyingly, every time you select a building to assign an icon, the menu closes itself making the process tedious.

Labor management is also tedious population often dies off and isn’t replaced, but there’s no way to highlight which buildings don’t have 100% staffing, so unless you want to risk (as I did, multiple times) discovering that some production chain has halted due to unfilled jobs, you’ll have to check buildings one by one. Additionally the surplus/deficit UI is unclear and it’s very difficult to figure out what consumes a specific resource and how big the deficit is.

[h2]Let me share two more “highlights”[/h2]:

[b]Lightning[/b]: The game has weather events like sandstorms, hurricanes, and droughts, these just apply production or morale penalties. But lightning? Lightning strikes out of nowhere - even on a clear day - and instantly destroys any building, from early-game tents to late-game mines. The only protection is the lightning rod, but it’s only unlocked deep into the midgame, making it almost pointless. It’s obvious lightning was added as a material sink, but it usually ends up one-shotting your freshly built structures.

[b]Water[/b]: A real masterpiece. Water is essential for everything and is consumed in massive amounts, however water amount on the map is finite (renew itself each year). I assumed that advancing technology would unlock deeper wells with larger reserves… nope. Better pumps just drain the existing water sources faster, so instead of upgrading pumps, it’s better to spam the basic ones everywhere (since they don’t require workers, roads, or electricity to function).

You’ve probably gotten a sense of the game’s issues by now. Personally, I like it, but I don’t think it’s a good purchase at the moment especially considering its high price. On top of that, after a year of development, only two out of four maps are available, and updates are slow and largely uninteresting from a gameplay standpoint.",False,26,0,1749222073,N/A,Steam

Placing buildings is a chore - having to switch between grid build and free build to rotate. Building roads is not fun at all. Have to find roads in the logistics tab, click on the road, then select where to begin and end... but this isn't simple because roads must be built in at least 3 square at a time, and linking buildings to roads provides no visual or audio confirmation that it worked and actually linked the roads.

The music is dreary and on a short loop. Music does not change to suit the events happening, pop ups or actions or seasons or anything.

When workers idle such as run out of resource to collect or there is storage is full, there is no visual or audio cue, or pop up. I have to manually check. Same for scouts - no sound or cute the scouts are idle. No cue someone died or joined workforce - If you don't manually monitor the chat log on left side, its all missed.

The game visuals are nothing special. Maybe these will improve as this ""Early Access"" game develops. Maybe other things will improve with quality of life and enjoyment of playing... but right now it is not fun to play.

I much more enjoyed FrostPunk, and even the old Caeser 3 city builder games. Glad I got this game on sale, would want a refund if paid full price.

Then I click on the terrain to go somewhere, and the camera zips across the map and I can't find where I was. I finally decide somewhere to lay down my town and the camera decides its going to zip again. I didn't click anything. Its clearly a bug.

Anger Foot,2198510,29.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",76561198115298850,"New Cycle (Early Access) - Preliminary Analysis and Constructive Feedback

New Cycle presents an intriguing proposition within the city-building and survival genre, placing the player in a post-apocalyptic setting with a dieselpunk aesthetic. Currently in Early Access on Steam, the game shows potential, but certain aspects of its current implementation warrant discussion and, potentially, refinement by the developers.

The premise of rebuilding society after solar cataclysms is captivating, and visually the game successfully creates an atmosphere consistent with its arid and challenging theme. The basic systems of construction and management of the population's needs are present and form a functional foundation for the gameplay.

However, two points stood out during my experience and, in my opinion, significantly impact the game's flow and player satisfaction:

Map Density and Resource Distribution: The size of the map and the dispersion of natural resources seem excessive in the current state. While scarcity and the need to explore are central elements of a post-apocalyptic survival game, the large distance between primary resource nodes and the initial settlement can make the early phases of the game slow and the central area of the map appears underutilized for long periods. This dispersion, without efficient long-distance transport mechanisms or more robust early-game exploration incentives, can create a feeling of ""emptiness"" in the world and focus the challenge more on resource collection logistics than on other aspects of colony management. A rebalancing of resource density, especially in the starting areas, or the introduction of mechanics that facilitate or incentivize exploration in a more dynamic way could mitigate this point.

Pace of Technological Progression and Learning Curve: The speed at which new technologies are unlocked in the research tree is remarkably fast. While access to new buildings and processes is exciting, the current pace does not allow the player sufficient time to implement, optimize, and fully understand the ramifications of newly acquired technologies before the next batch of unlocks is available. This not only diminishes the sense of achievement associated with each technological leap but can also lead to information overload and, consequently, confusion. The rapid transition between different technological ""eras"" prevents the mastery of specific mechanics for each phase, hindering the strategic depth that could be explored if the pace were more gradual. Adjusting the speed of technology unlocks to allow for a smoother learning curve, where the player has time to experiment with and consolidate the use of new tools before advancing, would be beneficial.

Concluding Remarks:

New Cycle has a promising foundation and an engaging theme. The points mentioned above seem to be, for the most part, issues of balance and pacing inherent in an Early Access title. I believe that addressing map density/resource distribution and, crucially, the pace of technological progression and how new mechanics are introduced, could significantly elevate the gameplay experience, making it more cohesive, challenging, and rewarding in the long run.

I recommend New Cycle to players who enjoy the city builder/survival genre and are willing to participate in the Early Access process by providing feedback. The game has the potential to become an excellent title in its category with proper polish.

I thank the developers for their work so far and eagerly await future updates.


New Cycle (Early Access) - Análise Preliminar e Feedback Construtivo

New Cycle apresenta uma proposta intrigante dentro do gênero de construção de cidades e sobrevivência, situando o jogador em um cenário pós-apocalíptico com uma estética dieselpunk. Atualmente em Acesso Antecipado na Steam, o jogo demonstra potencial, mas alguns aspectos da sua implementação atual merecem discussão e, potencialmente, refinamento por parte dos desenvolvedores.

A premissa de reconstruir a sociedade após cataclismos solares é cativante, e visualmente o jogo consegue criar uma atmosfera condizente com seu tema árido e desafiador. Os sistemas básicos de construção e gestão de necessidades da população estão presentes e formam uma base funcional para a jogabilidade.

Entretanto, dois pontos se destacaram durante a experiência e, em minha opinião, impactam significativamente o fluxo do jogo e a satisfação do jogador:

Densidade do Mapa e Distribuição de Recursos: O tamanho do mapa e a dispersão dos recursos naturais parecem excessivos no estado atual. Embora a escassez e a necessidade de explorar sejam elementos centrais de um jogo de sobrevivência pós-apocalíptico, a grande distância entre os nós de recursos primários e o assentamento inicial pode tornar as fases iniciais do jogo morosas e a área central do mapa parece subutilizada por longos períodos. Essa dispersão, sem mecanismos de transporte de longa distância eficientes ou incentivos de exploração mais robustos no early game, pode gerar uma sensação de ""vazio"" no mundo e focar o desafio mais na logística de coleta do que em outros aspectos da gestão da colônia. Um rebalanceamento na densidade de recursos, especialmente nas áreas iniciais, ou a introdução de mecânicas que facilitem ou incentivem a exploração de forma mais dinâmica poderiam mitigar este ponto.

Ritmo da Progressão Tecnológica e Curva de Aprendizado: A velocidade com que novas tecnologias são desbloqueadas na árvore de pesquisa é notavelmente rápida. Embora o acesso a novas construções e processos seja excitante, a cadência atual não permite ao jogador tempo suficiente para implementar, otimizar e compreender plenamente as ramificações das tecnologias recém-adquiridas antes que a próxima leva de desbloqueios esteja disponível. Isso não apenas diminui a sensação de conquista associada a cada avanço tecnológico, mas também pode levar a uma sobrecarga de informações e, consequentemente, à confusão. A transição rápida entre diferentes ""eras"" tecnológicas impede o domínio de mecânicas específicas de cada fase, prejudicando a profundidade estratégica que poderia ser explorada se o ritmo fosse mais gradual. Ajustar a velocidade do desbloqueio de tecnologias para permitir uma curva de aprendizado mais suave, onde o jogador tenha tempo para experimentar e consolidar o uso de novas ferramentas antes de avançar, seria benéfico.

Considerações Finais:

New Cycle possui uma fundação promissora e uma temática envolvente. Os pontos mencionados acima parecem ser, em grande parte, questões de balanceamento e pacing inerentes a um título em Acesso Antecipado. Acredito que abordar a densidade do mapa/distribuição de recursos e, crucialmente, o ritmo da progressão tecnológica e a forma como novas mecânicas são introduzidas, poderia elevar significativamente a experiência de jogo, tornando-a mais coesa, desafiadora e gratificante a longo prazo.

Recomendo New Cycle para jogadores que apreciam o gênero de city builder/sobrevivência e estão dispostos a participar do processo de Acesso Anteciado, fornecendo feedback. O jogo tem potencial para se tornar um excelente título em sua categoria com o devido polimento.

Not being able to queue up research is a pain as well, so you have to remember what the material requirements are for the research and then manually go in and queue it up when you have everything.
Overall though you just feel very disconnected from the citizen.
You need to manually go in and check up on morale constantly, because there's no indicator on the main display. It's no apparent what the morale sinks are, since before their morale was perfect and suddenly it's going down. Even though they are all fed, have health care, roof over their head etc.

Words cannot express how much this game makes me rage. Not the players, not the teammates, just this game (and truthfully also my skill if we're being honest). It's only fun if you can spend more than a couple of hours per day on it. If you're a grown adult, and can't spend more than a 2 hours across a regular week then you'll spend most of your time chillin in a lobby or watching your teammates play. 

This game is either a loading screen sim, or an interactive stream for when you die. I don't know if respawn ever got their head out of their asses with how fucked up Matchmaking was, but my god is it horrid. Playing solo is nice because from my experience it seemed like it was actually balanced. There were a few super sweats dropping 4k/20's but the rest felt like I was playing against people around my same skill level (averaged mid to upper gold back in 2024). The second you queue up with a friend or a squad the game decides to match you with people who you'd think just no life this game. They're out there doing the gymnastics movement skills and beaming people with an R9 from 300 yards out with very little recoil. After being killed you'd see that they were high diamond players, and this was every time, not just being unlucky to find the sweat, but like the whole ass lobby was playing in a whole rank a head of where you are. I could never understand how the game could think I could play against a diamond player in ranked. How is a Bronze 2 getting placed into a match with a fucking high diamond player. make it make sense.

The card rogue-lite everyone talks about. I understand why it's so popular, as almost everybody knows how to play cards and make a ""double"", a ""three of a kind"" or a ""flush"". Runs are also quite short and the high randomness makes all of them quite different. As a roguelike and/or deck-building game, it has big flaws: you aren't in full control of your deck (uncertainty and randomness are unavoidable) and the stacking of bonuses ([b]+[/b]chip, [b]+[/b]multi, [b]x[/b]multi) should have been clearer and better balanced. You can get to the point where a single card (a ""high"") scores more than a ""royal flush"", erasing all the fun of a card game. Game also lacks meta-progression, you just unlock more bonuses to be find on your runs. Runs are too short to build your deck or create long-term strategies - you are forced to just hope for good cards and push your luck. Best strategies focus only on gaining a lot of money to be able to reroll and trying to get (pray the RNG God) that couple uber bonuses.
For all those reasons, it's not the masterpiece some people talks about and I only recommend it for casual players (in that case, add +2 to the score). It is what it is: a casual, short-lenght, mobile game.

Trying to figure out how to balance these could be a fun learning curve. Looking at a screen full of numbers I tried mousing over them to see if there was a tool tip explaining when they meant or maybe some in-game help. No such luck. Playing hands blindly for a while I eventually ""won""? I was presented with a screen with an option to ""cash out"". Actually there was no other option. So cashing out is a good thing? Not sure. Next I'm presented with a joker that changes the rules of the game in many different ways, and a different joker-like card that is not a joker that also changes the rules of the game in many ways, and a store where I can buy cards for cash including, for my sins, a loot box. Then I'm presented with three different game modes with no explanation of why I would want to play one over the other. That is a lot of complexity to dump on the player all at once.

Lacking any help or more tutorials I wade into the game without understanding. I play some hands. Some numbers go up. Others go down. I'm not really sure what I should pay attention to. After a while it dawns on me. I have no idea what the goal is. Trying to figure out the byzantine rules and how they combine is slightly fun, but I have no sense of progress and no sense of purpose. The only thing I can tell for sure is when I win a round  I assume eventually I'll reach some sort of major win state, but frankly I lack the patience for it.

Eventually EVERYTHING hinges on you being just lucky enough with just the right set of jokers at just the right stages and it just stops being fun. Especially when what counts for the conditions of a card, i.e. what is considered an enhanced card, seems horribly arbitrary.

Furthermore - the conditions that cause deterioration are badly designed - losing points on Ramen, a multiplying joker that loses .01 of its multiplyer per card discarded, when the Boss Blind is Hook, a joker that discards 2 per hand played - this is ridiculous! The Arm, which takes away a level of a hand played - an utterly unfair Boss Blind that just makes your efforts feel wasted. 

The Wall and later Violet Vessel, especially on higher difficulties, are just cruel.

The only workaround Ive found that takes the combat from nearly an hour per conflict (obviously dependant on size of enemy group) is to cheese the shit out of items and set up a trap guantlet before starting the combat. Which, if I was playing on hard or above, I could respect. But I wasnt.

The gameplay feels really clunky and boring. In my head all I can think about is wow Fire Emblem 3DS and Switch was just this but so much better. After I tried to plea with steam to give it back and explain why I exceeded the 2 hours I tried to give it one more shot. The button layouts and just clunky gameplay made me skip turns.

Fire Emblem was more engaging than this and someone who likes that kind of combat sad to see its lazily done with basic character movements and now fluidity and camera movements.

It's all window-dressing, every choice eventually leads to the same outcome. No, really.

actual review, positives quickly, BG3 has a good amount of player choice but it's nothing completely revolutionary, it's around the same tier as FNV (which is impressive but it's nothing new) and there are a couple of strong moments towards the end of act 2 and act 3

negatives now, this game has a terrible early game (theres a reason people like starting at level 3-5 in tabletop) that feels directionless and causes the pacing to have significant issues that persist through the entire game. i tried my absolute hardest to stay invested in this games narrative but its just genuinely not very good.

the characters are also not great, there are some okay characters like gale and shadowheart, but the rest are either actually unfinished (wyll and karlach) or just stupid (lae'zel and astarion). idk, when i buy a narrative driven character based rpg, i want my narrative to be driving and characters to be based.",False,4,1,1763464344,N/A,Steam

I really liked the game at the beginning, but the further I progressed through the quests and locations, the worse my overall feeling became.
What I liked: I enjoyed the gameplay; I was really looking forward to the tactical combat, and it’s done well. There are issues with how certain skills work and how items and weapons interact, but it’s not critical and doesn’t ruin the experience. The spells with their variety of effects are well implemented, but the main thing is that the developers gave the option to complete a world full of magic without using magic at all. That’s real flexibility. That’s very good.

And now what annoys me: the complete lack of the feeling that I’m in the Forgotten Realms. The most important thing that distinguished the first two games in the series was that special feeling — the atmosphere of a familiar and beloved fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms. What do we have here? No atmosphere. Just some references and fantasy-world attributes like castles and dragons that don’t fit together at all. The ridiculous bosses from the second chapter — what even are they? Why are they here? You came up with them and shoved them into the game because… what? They feel more suited to some random Asian game where weapons are twice the size of a person.

The biggest disappointment is the characters. All the characters are awful, absolutely all of them. It feels like they took a modern person, dressed them up, put makeup on them, and dropped them into a fantasy world. And because of that, all the characters feel out of place, like mannequins or functions. “Let’s let the player be a vampire! How original! But we’ll also let them walk around in broad daylight — because magic.” Rubbish! But even worse is that they have zero motivation. And not just zero — their motivations are completely uninteresting. There’s nothing to empathize with; all they provoke is irritation.

The only character who felt coherent and adequate was Sarevok, but he was taken from the first game and somehow managed not to be mangled by the writers.",False,7,2,1763316181,N/A,Steam

I wanted to like it and share this experience with friends who are deeply into it, and I just can't. 

Game play is straight out of the 1990s and hasn't advanced once bit since BG1. They even added a very intrusive dice roll animation just to make sure any immersion in the game is impossible. This isn't a computer game, it's a tabletop game simulator. Dice rolls and turn based combat are limitations of table top games, not features. Simulating them is bad game design. 

The writing is just awful, no taste at all. Dialogs are menu choices with only stupid cliche options. Because the protagonist's lines are not voice acted, dialogs never feel like conversations, but more like overhearing someone talking on the phone. Party members are one-dimensional and incredibly annoying. It's like a D&D campaign written by a 12 year old. Turn based combat is incredibly tedious. This was fine 25 years ago, but it's just not acceptable in the 21st century. It's completely impossible to care about the plot, if there is one, because all the characters are so fundamentally unrealistic and un-likeable that it's just impossible to care about them. I want them to suffer and die. I wonder if this game was written to appeal to nostalgic memories of playing table top games in high school. I don't have such nostalgia so it falls completely flat. 

The graphics look plastic and cartoonish and the artwork is just standard fantasy cliches. The music is incredibly twee, repetitive and annoying. It just looks cheap, cartoonish and lacking any kind of taste, almost like it's AI generated. 

Unfortunately this is the worst game I've ever played by a very large margin. I really wanted to like this. I was expecting something like Oblivion or Skyrim - other fantasy based RPGs, that offered vastly better game play, art work, writing and even graphics almost 2 decades ago.

The graphics look like Dragon Age Inquisition but zoomed out and the camera is only one step up form a poor 2000s platformer. Why  is this game so popular?

Edit: So I gave it another 5 hours but the story and the characters are just not hooking me. For a game that I feel relies on its story, pretty heavily, I can't say its a good fit, at least not for me.

[b]The problem[/b]
Once every few months, a major update comes out, adding new game contents. Sadly, each update has a chance to prevent the game from running on random computers.

[b]New libraries required[/b]
The issue lies in new requirements in regard to dll libraries. Unfortunately the developer studio doesn't care to list these changes in the changelog, so users can only guess which dll files are required to run the game.

At first, the game started to require the library [i]xinput1_4.dll[/i], and this is [b]outrageous[/b] because one can simply rename the [i]xinput1_3.dll[/i] into the new one and the game works...
So what's been really added to the game apart from a hidden requirement? What does the [i]xinput1_4.dll[/i] add over the [i]xinput1_3.dll[/i] if the game works by simply renaming the older version of the library into the new one?
Nothing.

Then they started to require [i]api-ms-win-core-winrt-error-l1-1-0.dll[/i] and [i]api-ms-win-core-winrt-error-l1-1-1.dll[/i], and I'm going to skip the part about how I learned about this... Regardless, was it so hard to put it in the changelog?

[b]The current situation[/b]
Last update broke the game, again, and some people are already complaining.
This situation makes Age Of Empires II Definitive Edition too unstable for being considered entertaining, because now users would be supposed to learn by themselves which new dll are required to run the game, all of this because developers didn't spend two seconds to write down these changes in the changelog.

Finally, the game hasn't changed much, apart from new civilizations, since the beginning. So, what's the point of adding new core dll requirements? Why do Age Of Empires I & III Definitive Edition continue to work flawlessy?

Just buy an RTS that's more stable and whose developers don't plague their costumers with new dll requirements every now.",False,3,0,1760617875,N/A,Steam

It's a classic game but the community is very toxic. There's a option to report a player after every match but they don't do anything about it.

Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.

Binding of Isaac Rebirth,250900,14.99,0,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561199050028794,"I was going to wait until I 100%ed this game to review, as I often do, but I just cannot. This game has been one of my favorites for so long. It is what introduced me to one of my favorite genres of games, all that stuff. That is when I was bad at complex thought. This game is not good. This game seems to be almost entirely luck based, and unlike so many other games in the genre, there is no way to mitigate that fact. There is no way to increase the quantity or quality of items and quite literally nothing is reliable in this game. I can excuse that, to an extent, but what I cannot excuse is the genuine fucking torture that is the tainted characters. The tainted characters are fun a lot of the time, yes. They are also genuinely awful to deal with. Tainted lost is one of the worst gaming experiences I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I love risk vs reward characters, and this is a character that expands upon that from one of my favorite characters, base lost. Unlike base lost, however, this one is bullshit. You get one hit per run a lot of the time. Which yes, is the ultimate skill check, but also, in a game that is so built on the leniency of getting hit, considering the bullshit spawning mechanics, tainted lost is so dreadful to play with. There should not be a skill check character in a game that so heavily relies on luck for anything to get done. And on the topic of luck, one of the ONLY ways in which you can mitigate it is by minmaxing every single floor. Which is fine, I enjoy minmaxing because of something that is wrong with me. But of course, there are speedrun achievements, So that is just more luck. And that is compounded when you are playing the other most dreadful character, tainted cain. I like tainted cain in concept. He is just so unfun to play with. Any run with him will take about 3 times as long as a different characters, and you still need speedrun achievements while playing him, which either entails getting the singular crafting recipe that allows you to skip said time requirement, or just not have basically any items. Genuinely fucking dreadful. There are numerous other things I could mention, like a couple of the challenges, which McMillen has gone on record stating that one of them is straight up not fun. but one thing is the fucking price oh my god. If you want the ""full"" experience, you need to pay for so much dlc. The base game is fine, more enjoyable even, but attempting to move from console to pc or something like that costs so much money. Oh my god and the curses. The fucking curse. On hard mode, which is the main mode you will be using if you want to beat the game, you have a 1 in 3 chance to have a curse on each floor, and they are frankly just not fun. Curses affect information and movement, and only one is even remotely entertaining, the other are just a nuisance, especially curse of the blind. It isn't fun to have less information, all it does is take up more of your time in this timesink of a game. Finally, before i write another essay length review, I just do not like how many achievements there are. I love achievements, but there is an achievement for every single unlock. It feels cheap. I understand the reasoning, but having a game with 644 achievements skews my stats in a way that is simply not that fun. So even outside of the game it causes issues. But for the good, the atmosphere and music is great, as well as the fact that when you do get a good run, it is genuinely very fun (provided you don't get tapped by a random little guy as tainted lost and lose 3 hours of progress without any fault of your own). This is not a very unbiased review. Im just mad. I sure the game is slightly better than I have portrayed it, but none of my critiques have been even close to nitpicks (other than the amount of achievements). Overall, it is a fine game, fun even.

It's certainly addictive, with great style and gameplay. I like the strategic side of it and there's decent enemy variety (although I'd like more). 

The game hides far too much information. If my stats are changing throughout a round, why can't I see them as they change? My damage increases in line with the dragon but I have no idea how much damage the dragon does and how much it increases my damage. Why can't I look at the synergies screen or my current abilities while choosing new abilities? It makes it very frustrating to optimise my build and understand which abilities are good or bad.

There is good fun gameplay variety with the number of weapons, characters and abilities. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the different weapons and how much they could change your strategy. I do think there is a huge balance issue. Some guns and abilities are incredibly powerful, must picks on every run while others are really weak. The three different builds are essentially guns, summons or elements, but elements is pretty bad on its own and fire is especially weak. You're better off going guns or summons and supplementing with frost (or some lightning). Going full damage is far more sensible than going defensive, especially in higher difficulties where enemies hit harder.

A good way to pass the time, and ideal for short play sessions. I'd rank it as better than Vampire Survivors but it falls far short of the lofty heights of Brotato.",True,4,0,1761769717,N/A,Steam

Brotato,1966900,4.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Strategy",76561198140442560,"This game is really dope. After a couple of play throughs, where you get to grips with the mechanics, the small tricks you can do (like baiting the large exploding enemies into bombing everyone by running close then backing up as a method of crowd control), the game isn't too tough to master. But I appreciate the fact that it puts the power fantasy first and makes it more accessible and less reliant on rng.

It also helps that the game encourages experimenting with builds by having 15 unlockable difficulty levels and a huge cast of unlockable characters and weapons that become absolutely busted when you take advantage of their perks through the upgrades you choose. Each weapon is distinct; the SMG rocks for elemental builds, while the shotgun is great for crowd control and skills based around reloading. Meanwhile the Batgun benefits from being buffed by both regular and summon attack buffs, so you can create an army of summons that decimate everything. There are several key skills to buff, like base attack, health, movement speed, as well as bonuses to your guns like elemental damage and other effects. So even if you can't get a skill you want to mainline, there's still pretty much always going to be something you can pick that will help you in the long run.

And all the fun is from breaking the game. There are infinite ammo builds, summon builds, multiple elemental combination builds (like one where, when lightning strikes a flaming enemy, they explode), and more based around the individual skills of the characters. Played properly, your screen will be a crazy mess by the end and you will have transcended mortality into a crazy kind of Godhood. It's a total blast to mess around with.",True,0,0,1760574649,N/A,Steam

What I liked:
- Immaculate vibes.
- I loved the sprite work of the characters, enemies, and summons.
- Once you've gotten the hang of the game most runs feel unloseable, you'll find a way to build your character within the first five level-ups.
- A varied roster of 12 characters with their own unique upgrades following boss-kills.
- A standard winning run takes around 25 minutes including time spent paused choosing upgrades, making it a good wind-down game if you're time-poor like me.
- Meta-progression in the form of runes, which provide upgrades to your stats, and character and weapon unlocks.

What I disliked:
- The runs can feel very samey after a while, as you're heavily encouraged to lean into your characters 'class'.
- This is especially prevalent with the Summoner classes, which can honestly be played by standing still for 80% of the game with some minor dodging required when bosses appear.
- Some rune choices have what is obviously the best-in-slot, and there's nothing encouraging you from changing the runes between runs.
- Some characters are definitely stronger than others. As an example Dasher spends approximately half of your run in their invulnerable deer form which scales with summon damage, which is already the strongest build in the game in my opinion.

Compare it to another game, say Vampire Survivors, you'll lose a small amount of health if you get hit by something, and a lot more if you're actively swarmed.

But once you understand the game, you almost never get hit. Add to that the game has become a lot easier with the later updates, it becomes somewhat trivial and not very satisfying to beat.

It also has a large handful of problems in my opinion. Maybe it's just not suited to my tastes for some things, but objectively I think there are other problems that can't be excused by preference.

Lots of stuff feels unfinished, including missing or convoluted UI elements. I found it very tricky to understand the upgrade paths, the language for abilities, and so on. Some things are unintuitive or incomplete in how they're written, and there are simple typos that show a lack of attention to detail.

There's little enemy variety, character builds are not that versatile and the characters don't feel sufficiently different to warrant unlocking all of them. Honestly some of the playstyles for weapons can feel more impactful than some characters. I think it would have been beneficial to give each character an active ability to further set them apart and allow for a bit more skill expression.

And then, I have quite a few complaints about the balance of the Rune system for persistent upgrades, and the actual in-game perks. Quite a few feel minimally impactful or downright useless. When you're presented with 5 choices and 3 of them aren't helping you, now you're choosing between 2 and that really limits the exploratory factor and variety run to run. After a while I knew which perks I was hunting for, and assuming I didn't get hosed my RNG my builds ended up looking 90% identical.

All that said it's reasonably fun for a few hours and worth $5, but it has a lot of problems I just can't get over. Art style is cool if a bit dark and muddy. Gameplay loop is pretty standard but the manual aiming adds a bit more to keep you involved. There's a decent amount of stuff to unlock so you feel like you're meta progressing, even if some of the stuff is not the most noticeable.

But nope, the devs had to add themes in their games that alienates a lot of their player-base and adds division.  Why add themes in the game that causes ""disagreement or hostility"" between players?

Celeste,504230,4.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198355933627,"I simply cannot understand the consensus around Celeste. It’s hailed as a modern platforming masterpiece, a game that masterfully blends challenging mechanics with a deep emotional narrative. To me, it felt like a punishing, repetitive slog wrapped in the guise of therapy, all served up with visuals that were ""retro"" in the most tedious way possible.

Let's start with the gameplay: the controls are supposedly ""tight,"" which is reviewer speak for ""there are only two buttons."" You jump and you dash. That’s it. For 20+ hours, you do these two things. The level design then simply becomes an exercise in chaining these two actions together in increasingly arbitrary and frustrating combinations. The game doesn't feel challenging in a fun, clever way; it feels cheap, like a series of instant-death puzzle boxes designed solely to inflate the death counter on the screen - a counter that the game tries to tell you is a badge of honor, rather than a monument to its poor difficulty scaling.

The core loop is relentless: die, respawn instantly, and repeat the same two-second sequence until your muscle memory snaps the joystick the right way. This isn't flow; it’s exhaustion.

And then there’s the story. This is where Celeste truly loses its way. The emotional narrative about protagonist Madeline dealing with anxiety and depression feels less like genuine introspection and more like a heavy-handed lecture constantly interrupting the action. Every time I finally started to get into a rhythm, the game would pause for another sequence of pixelated characters discussing their feelings with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The whole ""Badeline"" concept is so on-the-nose it's embarrassing.

Finally, the aesthetics. The pixel art is functional, I suppose, but it adds nothing of visual distinction. It feels like a deliberate choice to save on development resources while hiding behind the shield of ""nostalgia."" When every element on the screen is an extreme close-up of a few chunky squares, it just highlights the visual monotony of climbing the same mountain, just with slightly different colored rocks and spikes.

If you enjoy paying full price to feel frustrated while being told to ""be kind to yourself,"" then Celeste is for you. For everyone else, it’s an over-sentimentalized, repetitive platformer that should have stayed at the bottom of the pile.",False,5,0,1760139488,N/A,Steam

Celeste,504230,4.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198971094114,"Game is okay but not anything super special, it focuses too much on the precision part of precision platformer, which makes most of its challenges blur together in terms of feel despite there being a lot of variety in level design on paper. 

The progression of the game is also quite bizarre, where a large swathe of the level challenges are made purely optional to collect strawberries, a collectable that is there absolutely for bragging rights. I am all for intrinsic motivation in games, but what this ended up leading too is a lack of forward progression in levels. You either go for most collectables, in which case you will be stuck going to alternate rooms to do many of these mini challenges, dragging the pace to a halt, or just ignore them all, and get super short levels that don't feel as though they fully flesh out their respective level gimmicks. 

This isn't like New Super Mario Bros, where star coins are used to unlock content in the overworld and are placed mostly en route to your objective, which lead to them being useful to collect, without repercussing the pace of the game, yet not making the levels feel hollow if you decide to ignore them. Thus the inclusion of these collectables and their impact on the level design ended up taking a lot of the bite out of the progression in the game.

Aside from that the story is poorly integrated into the game with middling dialogue quality and I found the soundtrack to be the typical retro ost you hear in these kinds of games without much in it to separate it from what you hear elsewhere.

Gameplay: 10/10- turn based with a parry/dodge mechanic along with a really cool picto/lumina system to create a really cool build. The movement can be clunky at times but there are minigames that actually buy into the clunkiness as well. You wont have any issues navigating the world, compared to other open world games, the movement can feel clunky at times but to me it absolutely felt just fine and never once took away from the combat. Once you get the timings down, parrying isnt too hard at all. The builds in the game are awesome and are sort of endless in a way. You'll enjoy it. Gameplay feels like FromSoftware and Final Fantasy had a love child that got the best aspects of those games, while being better than both in every aspect. 

Story: Absolute Cinema/10: I mean, you played the game, and if you havent, you just need to witness this masterpiece, I honestly cant come up with words to describe it. Just be in the moment and enjoy it, cry with it, and let your heart be shattered into a million pieces. 

Soundtrack/Audio: ABSOLUTE LUMINA/10 - The entire soundtrack is unbelieveable. I have added some of these songs into my spotify rotation and i have no idea what the lyrics mean but theyre incredible

Visuals/Graphics: 10/10: The game looks incredible. All of the scenery is top notch, even the prerendered stuff looked IMMACULATE. Then world in this game is so stunning.

Performance: 10/10: Since alot of the backgrounds are prerendered I have no issues with a 4060ti, i7-14700f and 32GB of RAM at 1440p on high. I never ran into any performance snags at all. I of course tweaked settings but never did i have crashes, stutters, or anything while playing the game. It ran buttery smooth(which is not always the case for AAA titles yet here we are)

Voice Acting: Better Than alot of hollywood movies/10: Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, Andy Serkis is already beyond stacked for a cast. Every single member of the cast put on the performance of a lifetime. Im pretty sure they had rent due because every character has their emotional moment to shine, and they shine bright!

I dont need to keep categorizing you get my point. If you think its over hyped, glazed too much, or anything, just witness this masterpiece and youll change your mind. This game is legitimately one of the best games to come out in recent memory and I hope that Sandfall continues to make games with similar styles and gameplay to E33, because I will buy every game even if i have to pay double.

Reminds me of the books you have to read in school and everytime it's a drama. Because comedy was seemed not worth it, to be written down back in 1800 or 1900, so they took tradgedy, like in this game.

It has a parallel to the real world, we flee into things, to forget and what happened and be happy in this new world, we fled into. But we can't stay infinite time in that dream world and have to come back to reality. This is kinda depressing and true.

The game battle mechanics reminded me of the Southpark games ""Stick of Truth"" and the second one.

Great Soundtrack, the only issue for me is, they didn't implement some bonus tracks on the digital soundtrack edition on Steam. Songs like ""For those who come after"" and I think ""Our painted death"" are missing.

One funny spoiler is, if you dress your whole team in a bathing suit, then ""Renoir"" is also wearing one bathing suit in his cut scenes. Not sure if he is weaing it in fight too.

Theg game looks pretty in most scenes, has a great story, can be complicated to understand. Some minor ugly things can be the world you travel around.

- key bindings are not great and frustratingly, some keys cannot be changed. And these were the most used combat keys like one key of ASD as well as ESC key. Pressing ESC every time after aiming is just horrible experience. What were they thinking? Did any developer play the game on PC?
- game heavily depends on dodging and parrying but on my PC it was nearly impossible to do so effectively due to input lag and stuttering.

If the game were strictly linear, I wouldn’t have minded, but a good portion of it is about exploration, and you never know if you're going the way that will progress the story and trigger a cutscene, or if you're finding a side path with optional enemies and items, or if you're just circling around aimlessly.

Lore wise it looks interesting but in general story, not that much. It has a serious tone but with JRPG cringe dialogs which I don't like at least for this game. It starts interesting at first and tries to make you feel bad with characters which you don't know nothing about. You have to feel bad, yeah? I felt nothing in prologue whatsoever. Characters are OK, I guess. I like the some interactions between them apart from the cringe worthy dialogs. They have some chemistry between them but I don't really form a connection with characters.

GAMEPLAY
In short, I don't like it. I'm not a big fan of turn based combat but I have my fair share of them. I don't really like the idea of QTE rhythm type of dodge and parry mechanics. I think it's alright to have some of kind QTE for combat but in this, it's the main mechanic. I don't think it's working for a turn-based game. You only care for DPS, not about healing and defence because you can dodge and parry. So, you're making a build for DPS only.

Bit of a nitpick but some of the enemies have animation and audio sync problem. Sometimes audio plays too early which makes me press the dodge or parry button instinctively only to get me wrecked by it until I get used to it.

I don't really like the level design. I think it's a bit confusing with all the colours and stuff but world looks gorgeous. One of the prettiest worlds I have ever seen and has a NIER vibe which I like.

This game is OK but not for me. I got bored because of the easy gameplay and story. If you don't like rhythm type of games, souls like dodge/parry mechanics or If you are looking for a turn-based game with strategic gameplay it's a pass.",False,3,1,1763903831,N/A,Steam

Because of this, it never really is able to be a good version of either. It's strategy components are puddle deep and easily exploitable. Warfare amounts to building centralized military in the 800s, and because the AI can't think strategically, you just steamroll everything that hasn't been over-buffed by the devs (Like the mongols).
  The roleplaying elements have a shelf life because everything is handled through events, you play through menus so you can only be given character moments through text, and because its all random events that have been pre-written there`s a distinct lack of character for your characters. 
  Several of the game's systems have also just been left to rot completely. I don't even need to list them here because almost every game system has just been neglected. Devs are focused on adding new content, which is fine, but surely you can hire a new team to update and upkeep the old content? Stellaris is actually a great example of this working. (Despite that game's current issues.)
  Unfortunately I just don't think you should play CK3. If you want a good Grand Strategy game, play EU4 or HOI4 or even VIC3. Heck, go play Imperator: Rome.

This bug has been known since 2022 and is still active.
The Problem: When your ruler dies, and the Culture Head title briefly transfers to an AI, that AI instantly uses the chance to cancel and change your ongoing cultural reformation.
The Consequence: This arbitrarily wastes 20-30 years of development time, gold, and prestige and is an unfair punishment for a core game event (succession). The AI is operating under rules that the player does not have (players cannot cancel their own ongoing reforms). Do not buy this game until Paradox addresses this critical inconsistency. The core mechanic of shaping your culture is currently too vulnerable to random AI interference.
This is a widely reported issue, confirmed by the community:
Confirmed - NPC's switching your Cultural Tradition mid-establishing
CK III - AI cancels the current reform culture type while my emperor is a child
CK III - New culture head changes a reform in progress, but I can't do the same!
Game breaking issue, AI randomly changes culture reformation in progress

[h2]Presentation and Narrative[/h2]
- Deep and very expansive Lore, Supergiant Games’ never miss when creating a world from scratch.
- Gorgeous Art and Music. Supergiant Games aways are top notch with their art and music.
- Gobsmackingly great World building. Supergiant Games can just whiff up worlds and stories that all cohese into one big story.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
- This is basically NBA Jam if it was 3 VS 3 with ofc more gameplay elements mixed in.
- I switched playing on a controller and it felt better.
- Only played the campaign, and over all it’s a mix of visual novel, rpg, sports game.
- Going around challenging other parties to the rites while also exploring the world at a whole.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Technicality and Value[/h2]
- From the makers of Bastion and Transistor, Supergiant Games’ 3rd Game
- Goes very cheap on sale.
- Versus Mode that you can play with Bots or Friends, via Couch or Remote Play Together
- Would see this as a good couch play with friends, but you’ll need patient friends as the game itself takes some time to get used to.
- I played this for the Campaign alone and judging only by that, the game is still worth it’s price.

目前玩到的部分就是把郝德文算是第一次送出了下界，当时游戏刚刚开始的时候就是他对玩家展示出了最大的善意所以也是首先选择送他出去 （而且他不强）
【美术5/5】这游戏的美术是绝对没得说的是我觉得简直可以称为艺术品的感觉 尤其是把郝德文送走了之后,车子就解锁了飞天功能,然后在各个世界穿梭的时候会有一种在翻书的感觉,每一个世界都是重叠在另外一个世界之下或者之上的。 而且 Supergiant 这家公司很强的地方就是配色都非常鲜艳,但是却一点都不让你觉得杂乱,就真的很好看。像插画一样,每一幅画面都像插画一样。 
【音乐4/5】这个游戏的音乐也很好听。特别是中间有几个段落。比如说翻越海洋的时候要走向最终的北极的时候。都会有一段人声的歌唱然后我当时还停下来听了不少时间。还有一开始序章的时候三个人把玩家捡到的似乎后，背景音乐就有那种荒野的感觉 相比很多其他玩完了都没有任何音乐感觉的游戏来说这个游戏的音乐真的算很不错 
【游戏性2/5】不得不说,这个游戏真的不是我特别喜欢的那种。就是纯粹为了看剧情换画面才勉强玩了玩它的这个抢球的游戏。 操作非常不舒服因为能控制的角色只有一个然后另外两个角色是处于完全没有任何防御的状态的就很容易被敌人打死 反正我不喜欢而且打完了初次通关之后也没什么动力继续玩下去了先就这样吧",True,0,0,1760854537,N/A,Steam

And i had that confirmed when i realised that Supergiant developed this game. They managed to weave the seemingly impossible and combine two genres i'm usually not a fan of (visual novels and sports like games) and create one of the most unique, finely crafted, GORGEOUS and fun experiences i've had in a long time.

I love so many ranges of indie games but this has become easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. The story and characters i adore, the soundtrack is INCREDIBLE (and Darren Korb has the voice of an angel), this is one of the most jaw droppingly beautiful games i've ever seen. There is truly so so much i could go on about but i'll save the gushing and just say please try this game out. Especially for the price. It's a crying shame that this game got so little attention compared to their other work. And i will continue to sing this game's praises for as long as i can (along with their other works) and i will continue to support them in any way i can.

This game is not for everyone in terms of gameplay but that's ok, i'm happy as long as more people get to try an absolutely incredible experience. 

And if anyone at Supergiant reads this, thank you for your work. Your art and music is always something i and many more eagerly look forward to. You've been an artistic inspiration for so many people and your passion for what you do is so inspiring to all, As an aspiring game dev, artist and hopefully someday composer, there's so much i can learn from you. This may be just gushing but that's because i have nothing but positive things to say and this game along with Hades have become so special to me.

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198367471798,"Pyre, developed and published by Supergiant Games, stands as one of the most daring and unconventional narrative experiences in modern gaming. Known for their emotionally resonant and stylistically distinct titles like Bastion and Transistor, Supergiant took a risk with Pyre, merging the structure of a visual novel with the mechanics of a fantastical sports competition. The result is an experience that feels unlike anything else—a fusion of story-driven role-playing, tactical action, and moral choice, all wrapped in a richly imagined world of exile and redemption. Pyre is not content to simply tell a story; it asks players to participate in the creation of that story through their choices, triumphs, and failures.

The game takes place in a world divided between the Commonwealth, a rigid society that banishes anyone who breaks its laws, and the Downside, a vast, mystical wasteland where exiles are sent to live out their days. You play as the Reader, a literate outcast in a world where reading is forbidden. Rescued by a small band of exiles, you quickly become their guide and strategist, using your ability to interpret the Book of Rites—a sacred text that details the mystical competitions that grant freedom from exile. These contests, known as the Rites, form the heart of the game’s structure and symbolize the hope of redemption. Each victory brings one of your companions closer to liberation, but also closer to departure, as those who win are granted freedom and must leave the group behind. This mechanic transforms what might have been a simple victory condition into an emotional choice—winning means losing someone important.

The Rites themselves are a fascinating blend of tactical sport and magical ritual. Two teams of three face off in mystical arenas, each attempting to extinguish the other’s pyre by delivering a celestial orb into it. The rules are simple but layered with nuance. Each character on your team has unique abilities, movement styles, and aura sizes, which affect both offense and defense. Some are fast and agile, capable of darting across the field to score quickly, while others are slower but powerful, able to banish opponents from play with bursts of energy. The challenge comes from learning how to balance these traits, chain passes, and outmaneuver the opposition. The pace of the Rites sits somewhere between a real-time strategy match and a competitive sports game, emphasizing positioning, timing, and coordination. The sense of tension in each match is amplified by the fact that no defeat is final; losing a Rite does not end your journey but instead reshapes it, influencing character relationships and the ultimate direction of the story.

Pyre’s decision to let the story continue regardless of success or failure is one of its most inspired design choices. Rather than enforcing perfection, it allows the narrative to adapt dynamically, emphasizing the weight of choice and consequence. Every victory and every loss becomes part of the journey, shaping how your companions perceive themselves and you. It’s a design philosophy that challenges the typical game structure where failure means repetition. In Pyre, failure carries meaning. Losing a match may alter who gains freedom, who remains trapped, and how your group evolves emotionally. These narrative ripples make each playthrough personal and distinctive, encouraging you to accept the story as your own rather than chasing an ideal outcome.

Outside the arenas, much of the game unfolds through richly written narrative segments aboard your caravan, the Blackwagon, as your band of exiles travels across the Downside. Here, Pyre resembles an interactive novel, filled with branching dialogue, world-building lore, and moments of quiet reflection. You converse with your companions, learn their histories, and make decisions that affect morale, resources, and relationships. The characters themselves are among Supergiant’s finest creations—each distinct, complex, and layered with humanity despite their fantastical forms. There’s Hedwyn, the optimistic warrior who seeks peace for everyone; Jodariel, the stoic demon whose loyalty masks deep vulnerability; Rukey, the scrappy cur who hides his insecurities behind humor; and countless others who join along the way. As you journey together, bonds form and break, and the group’s dynamic evolves in ways that feel organic and emotionally authentic. When the time comes to choose who earns their freedom, these relationships give the decisions a poignant gravity—every liberation feels like both a triumph and a loss.

Visually, Pyre is a masterpiece of color and design. The Downside is depicted as a dreamlike wilderness, filled with desolate deserts, haunted ruins, and glowing celestial fields. The hand-painted art style is lush and vivid, each scene glowing with painterly detail. Supergiant’s artistic direction is unmistakable—fluid animation, bold use of color, and striking character portraits make every frame feel alive. Complementing the visuals is the extraordinary sound design. Darren Korb’s soundtrack is both haunting and uplifting, seamlessly weaving folk, choral, and atmospheric elements that evoke the game’s emotional and spiritual themes. The narration, delivered by Logan Cunningham, adds depth and presence, his gravelly voice acting as both chronicler and conscience throughout your journey. Together, the art and music create an otherworldly atmosphere that lingers long after the game is over.

While Pyre’s ambition is undeniable, it’s not without its shortcomings. Some players may find the abundance of text and lore overwhelming, especially early on when the world’s terminology and politics are introduced at length. The pacing can occasionally feel uneven, as stretches of introspective narrative are followed by bursts of frenetic gameplay. Additionally, while the Rites are mechanically unique, they can begin to feel repetitive after dozens of matches, especially if players find themselves favoring certain strategies or team compositions. The lack of an online multiplayer mode also limits the long-term replayability of its competitive component, though a local versus option provides a glimpse of its potential as a standalone sports experience. Still, for most players, these issues are minor compared to the richness of the overall experience.

At its core, Pyre is a game about redemption, sacrifice, and the nature of freedom. It asks what it means to lead, to forgive, and to let go. Every decision you make reflects not only your tactical skill but your moral compass. The story’s multiple endings depend on the choices you make, the Rites you win or lose, and the companions you choose to liberate. Few games so elegantly integrate narrative consequence with gameplay mechanics, and fewer still make you feel the emotional weight of those consequences so profoundly. Pyre rewards empathy and introspection as much as strategic thinking, making it as much a moral journey as a mechanical one.

In the end, Pyre is more than just a game—it’s a work of art that defies easy categorization. It combines the heart of a novel, the soul of a myth, and the structure of a sport into a single, cohesive experience. Its willingness to subvert expectations and trust the player to accept imperfection is what makes it special. Every match, every dialogue choice, and every sacrifice builds toward a personal story of struggle and redemption that feels entirely your own. Supergiant Games has crafted something rare with Pyre—a game that not only entertains but invites reflection, one that lingers in the mind like an unfinished song, echoing long after the final Rite has been won or lost.

You _can not_ win in a 1 vs 3 AI firing on all cylinders, its not physically possible, so making that a part of the game is objectively garbage design. There is no satisfaction to it even when you do pull it off because you know the computer just let you do it. You can even see when you pull too far ahead of the computer and itll rubber band itself back up by playing normally and scoring a goal almost instantly with zero hope of stopping it. 

Obviously a computer can beat humans in a lot of tasks, but when you lay it so completely bare for the player, that no, you can not win, the only time you will is because its deigned to let you this time around is frustrating trash games creation, and by a huge margin the worst thing Ive seen in any this studios games.

Edit: I want to flesh this out a bit cause the trials are just one small part of the game, so what about the rest.
Well, as others have pointed out its actually more visual novel than it is game, given much of the game play doesnt even really have much bearing on things. There are some neat characters, but the story is quite scatter shot and didnt have the same impact on me as Bastion, Hades, and certainly not Transistor.

The game play more broadly is... fine, I think you might get the impression from my main complaint that my issue is with the difficulty, that I just need to git gud, but no, in fact I played it on Nightwing difficulty (cause Im a filthy completionist.) and actually found it to be a better experience than my first play through. The issue isnt difficulty, its how very apparent the AI is, Im just very aware Im playing against a computer and it doesnt feel good, it isnt satisfying: I won almost all my games on normal, and the majority on Nightwing, and it still never felt like the game play had really clicked with me, while the computer always made me feel like it was just letting me win half the time. (The corollary of this is that it also often feels unfair when you dont win.)

The trials are where this is most egregious, because as I say, its essentially impossible to win 1 vs 3 without the AI deliberately sabotaging itself and there is nothing good about winning like that, I genuinely dont understand the decision to put that in the game. Regardless, it is a problem the whole way through, and when Im not that married to the story (or many of the characters for that matter), there really isnt much here for me outside of some good music as always, and the world which Id kinda like to see more of... but in a different game.",False,1,1,1721702484,N/A,Steam

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198025321433,"Supergiant is a good developer and I see what they were going for with Pyre, but I just don't think it's engaging or interesting enough to play for very long. I loved Bastion, Hades is fantastic and I see why people like Transistor (though personally, the battle system ruined the game for me), but Pyre doesn't really have much to offer.

The game is half visual novel, half sports game. In the visual novel portion, you learn more of the residents and exiled of the Downside who try to make their way back up to the Commonwealth, travel around with a band of misfits and companions as the reader, and challenge other exiled to the ""rites"". Those ""rites"", the other half of the game, are essentially a mix of soccer and rugby. In these 3v3 matches, the goal is to pick up a ball and deliver it to the enemy's Pyre. Every exile has their own playstyle, some are really fast, others can fly shortly, others are really big and block a large part of the area. Every exile also has a field around them, which you can touch enemies with to banish them shortly, or send it forth in a wave as a ranged attack.

It's an interesting concept, but as a game, Pyre doesn't have much to offer. The visual novel portion, while set in gorgeous landscapes with Supergiant's usual style, and accentuated by a good soundtrack, is unnecessarily wordy. New terms are thrown at you constantly, with many different names and circumstances you are expected to become familiar with (or not, as many terms are bolded so you can instantly hover over them to know what they mean). The different exiles are somewhat interesting in their personalities and most of them are likeable, but you don't really get much time to interact with them due to the game's pacing.

The game works as follows: click on a star in the sky to guide you, then travel to that areain a series of cutscenes. Sometimes you can choose one of two or three paths where you can find items like talismans to equip or to sell, and sometimes you can do vocations which grant bonuses, but generally, there isn't really a ""wrong"" choice. After a few minutes, you are at the next rite, and then it starts all over up to the liberation rite, which decides who of your exiles go free. Then, you do it all over again - 6 times, as I've understood, before the game is officially over.

There isn't much more to the game than travel, rite, travel, rite, travel, rite. The rites themselves are fun at first, but get boring and very repetitive very quickly. After one liberation rite, I had enough and can not imagine doing this another 5 or so times. The worst part is that nothing you do really matters - the story continues, whether you win or lose. As I understand, it does affect the ending somewhat, but it feels like there is nothing at stake and so, overall, I felt like I had seen enough after liberating one exile.

In my opinion, Pyre is definitely the weakest title of Supergiant, because unlike most of their other offerings, the gameplay isn't deep or interesting enough to be entertaining longterm, and the world and story, while interesting at first, are too fragmented and cryptic to really care about after the initial few hours. Good characters and a good soundtrack / artstyle can't save Pyre from being a mediocre game and I think even Transistor, which I personally didn't like all that much, was more fun to me.",False,2,0,1714091556,N/A,Steam

The game tries to claim RPG status by giving the illusion of choice constantly.  But the choices all end up exactly the same, thus making this a Visual Novel...  not an RPG.

This is the text that appears after a dialogue between two characters of your party. This happens near the end of the campaign. The dialogue preceding this was moderately long and establishes with no subtlety that they are friends who have disagreed in the past. There were no choices to be made and new information was not revealed. The line about drawing strength from one another has no effect, to the character or gameplay wise if you put the two characters on a team. It is well written filler text, and it exemplary of why I do not recommend this game.

You will spend a vast majority of the campaign reading filler text. The text will ask nothing of you - no mysteries to deduce, no characters to unravel, no choices to be made except for flavor text. You'll solve mysteries when the text is programmed to reveal the answers. You'll get character bonuses when the text declares it's time to get bonuses. You'll get resolutions when the script decides it's the right battle to resolve an arc. You can skip the text and you won't miss any opportunities to better your team.

For being primarily a visual novel, Pyre is deeply disappointing in using text as if it was a static script written external to the game. It should have been an easy recommendation considering how strong it is mechanically and visually. Much love was poured into this project.

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561199007747406,"I must preface this by saying that my expectations of this game were unreasonably high going into it, since Pyre is made by Supergaint Games and I highly enjoyed Hades. Even still, this game was a disappointment. The environment's, characters, and tiny details in the story are all incredible. Every environment is packed with charm and details and could easily be a screen savor or hung up on a wall. All the characters have a great amount of depth from what I have seen and feel like real people, interesting real people at that. Finally, the music is incredible and I will need to go listen to the full soundtrack later. Every part of the game outside of the core game-play, the ""rites"", is incredible. The only problems are with the ""rites"". The idea of three versus three basketball for the core game-play is unusual for an rpg, but the idea in and of itself is really interesting. However, the execution fails. You can only control one team member at a time, and to switch team members, you need to be looking at the team member and hold down the space bar. On top of that, while you have the ball, you must throw the ball before you can switch team members. You throw the ball by holding down the space bar, which slowly increases the distance you will throw the ball, something that feels very clunky. Additionally, teammates do nothing while you aren't controlling them. Finally, the A.I opponents can switch between teammates instantly and throw the ball instantly. This all incentives you to only play as the fastest character in your party, since they can easily avoid the A.I on normal difficulty. The only reason your other party members aren't useless is that after you score with a teammate, you temporarily can't use them. You can only use them again after another teammate scores. This way of forcing the player to use more than one team member quickly turns the game into a two versus three game and just makes me wish the game allowed you to have other players control the other team members or was one versus one. The final problem with Pyre is the speed of game-play. The game feels like it wants to require complex strategy and quick reflexes. The game fails to give players opportunities for either, as the game-play is too slow to require good reflexes and too fast to allow for complex strategy. All these problems combine to create a game that feels like its trying to do too many things and is only succeeding with the story.

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,19.99,0,solo/multiplayer,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198079795608,"In essence, I think that the gameplay itself isn't all that great.
In it's core it's a sports game of sorts. If you know M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) from the early nineties, it might be the closest thing to this game. I suspect it seems fun on paper, but feels slow and clunky.
I tried various controller layouts as well as a PS4 controller. I never felt much in control of the characters. Maybe I lack the strategic teamplay aspect, I don't know.

Everything else is a different story.
There is a world that looks gorgeous, the character designs are great as well. The animations are charming and wonderful, I can only praise what I see. It's unique and very enjoyable. I would have put this game away much faster if it wasn't for it's design.

Part of the design is the sound as well. The voices (although unintelligible glib) are well done, every hit, flame and movement make the right noises. The music is unique and just a joy to fall into it's thick atmosphere. Atmosphere in general is a really strong point of this game. It's well-crafted and something that welcomes you to stay.

The story itself is less of a drawing point. It's deliberately obfuscating. There is no mystery because you're constantly confused. It even goes so far as to have keywords that you can hover over to give some sort of context. It's hermetic and hard to get through. There is an argument to be had to have a very unfamiliar world, but at some point it's becoming heavy handed as you constantly need to relearn vocabulary to understand what's going on. Final Fantasy 13 had a similar approach where the world would make sense if you read long articles that were supposed to be optional. This game expects you to read a lot. So it sort of falls into a kind of visual novel. While it's written well, it never managed to draw me in. I understand that they are in some sort of underworld where they want to get out of. On the other hand, the world above doesn't seem to be a much better place with probably an even worse way of living. So the goal is muddy at best.

So that's what I got: 
Characters that are amazing artworks and quite unique - but lacking interesting personalities. Sure, everyone has their kind of tragic backstory, but there isn't much more to it.
The atmosphere and the world design are visually outstanding and I'm glad to have seen it in all it's glory. The animations are so smooth and charming that I don't know if I'd have anything that could match it - again, in a very unique style and done by true artisans. Same goes for the music that really strengthens the atmosphere. That part is absolutely fantastic.
Then there is sort of a visual novel that I don't find interesting.
Lastly there is a sports game that I never got the hang of and is more frustrating than interesting. Sure, SuperGiant always was on the experimental side of things and I usually search for experiences that differ from the norm. Transistor was brilliant and offered great gameplay. Pyre just wasn't fun to play for me.

If old sports games are your thing, you might enjoy it. It might be that I could put in some more hours to get the hang of it and it probably could transform into a fun game.

It has lots of elements that Supergiant has polished to a gleam by this point - wonderful characters, graphics, voice overs and music, and Supergiant fans should probably check it out, if just for those.

Unfortunately, at its core, the game revolves around the 'Rites', a sporting event where your team of three tries to get its orb to the other side. There's more to it than that, with unique characters, powers, and a, in theory, impressive plethora of combos and strategies that you could devise and employ. Unfortunately it just isn't fun. Too fast to let you focus on strategy, but with movement and controls too clunky to focus on reflexes and intuition.

The story and characters will leave a lasting impression on me, but the truth is that I persisted with the game just to experience the story. Held hostage by great character building.

First issue I had it took almost 4 hours until the game opened up so I can choose who to fight.  
I heard it was mostly visual novel with little combat and because of that I thought game would be more open ended, choosing what characters to speak to, learning more about them and having some open ended options about their stories based on your dialog, but so far it was mostly listening to them speak and other than who to liberate I didn't feel like I had input in their stories or that even who I liberated mattered.

But my biggest reason for giving it thumbs down is combat. It feels so clunky and most of the time enemy scored was because I wasn't able to switch my character in time or misclicked on them.

- Wholesome content.
- Teamwork mechanic is smooth.

I had seen some stuff they made during development and I have to say the models are pretty well made. The game uses vibrant colors and easy to understand concepts to reach out to a younger audiance. 
There are still some things that could be improved, like the lag during cutscenes (I think this is due to the loading of the next level) and the jump animation is a little odd. Also it was really quiet in the last level, which could be by choice, but I'd like some music better. 
Apart from that it's a cute game you should try out to support the hardworking people that made this game.

You play Kika (player 1), the granddaughter of a private detective and she has clearly inherited his passion for solving mysteries.
Together with her corgi Daigo (player 2) she tries to find her grandfather back.

The 3D models are simple yet cute (the fork-lift truck <3), same for the cutscenes. There are some surprisingly witty interactions with the world.

Hopefully they will add more levels and make the camera a bit smoother, but apart from that it's fun to play for an hour with a friend or alone (you don't have to move both Kika and Corgi at the same time, with a few doable exceptions).

We start off with what looks like an 80s style cartoon show. The plot is written and now your soul is suddenly owned by the devil himself. And of course the only way to clear the debt is to play the game and win it. Sounds easy right?

Wrong. Playing this game with another person will drive you both mad. It's not enough to play perfectly but you both have to play perfectly. Due to the share screen nature both players have to stay in sync or risk slipping or stalling the screen from progressing whiles enemies and projectiles continue their trajectory towards your little bodies with big cup heads as easy targets.

Pain aside, this game is genuinely fun when you can finally clear a stage. It takes hours and hours, sometimes days to finally reach the next level. But when you do that feeling is unforgetable. Its the kind of game that exemplifies the value of perseverance. For young kids this game can potentially be a good teacher in that aspect.

[b]TOO MUCH FU**ING STUFF HAPPENING AT THE SAME FU**ING TIME.[/b]
I don't mind impossible bosses but in the first world, the flower and the flying boss just showed how terrible this game can get with so much stuff happening on the screen at the same time that it becomes impossible to keep track of.
Yes, I did beat them but the experience was terrible and even when I did beat it, it was mainly chance that something happened at the correct time.

I thought I am playing something like Hollow Knight but this game is more like Geometry Dash and I fucking hate Geometry Dash where you don't win because of your skill but because you have remembred what exactly to do.

Compare this to Sekiro where you can beat a completely new boss but you still know what skill will work and what will not work and can make a good guess so that makes it fun. FUCK SEKIRO, that game was so good it has ruined every other game for me.

I like difficult games that involve skill.
With this I am just frustrated because all my deaths are not based on my skill but on random events and terrible hit-boxes or just playing the same level over and over again until you learn what to press at every time.

Yeah, I didn't play much of this before requesting a refund, and I will admit that this game does not suit my taste. I bought it with only the knowledge that it's difficult, but when I began playing it, I realized that there is zero exploration and 100% boss rush/gauntlet.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the game itself is bad. It's just not my taste, but I didn't know that when I bought it. 

I adore the aesthetic of Cuphead. The art and design just drip with love and care from the developers. But I just don't like the idea of playing a game just to immediately jump into a boss level. I enjoy games that have difficult bosses but with interesting level exploration for reprieve.

Finished the game.

I'm baffled. So much effort went into making all those bosses with their animations. Visually game is very creative. Literally epic. But that's that.

Game's is not that hard since i played many NES games. But that's actually real problem. 1980s called -  they want their gameplay back. The thing is that back then we had nothing else and all that ""memorize patterns"" stuff was relevant. But when you see this approach in modern games like Dark Souls, Cuphead and whatsoever, it's really sad. The only thing that was changed here is that boss timings (attacks, moves) are slightly randomized with shifted delays. And this is not challenging. I wish studio would focus on gameplay as they did with 1930s style. Gameplay is designed to waste your time with random timings, broken hitboxes and things on foreground that disctract you.

Levels and bosses are ""one-offs"": you try 10-20 times, beat it, forget it, time to move on. Playing game feels like having a second job. It's just not fun. Upgrades are nominal, you can easily beat the game with peashooter. Parrying is useless mostly.
When you die you have to watch that intro animation and listen to narartor which breaks the flow. In Super Meat Boy after dying you instanlty begin from start and ready to try again.

Here's zero variation on how to beat enemies: no combos, no nothing. Just hold attack button and move on. It worked in games like Contra since they were short and you beat games within 15-30 minute time range. Here whole game consists of Sonic, Chip & Dale and other games' bosses and it's really exhausting. Whats worse - it's not rewarding at all.

So the only people who would like this game are ego driven 20-year-olds who think they ""ain't no punk b1tch"", i guess. I'm too old to be motivated by being annoyed or wanting to show off.

DLC显然把“只靠招架取胜”的王堡明显按圣杯小姐的冲刺招架去适配，当用原配茶杯头/马克杯尝试时，玩家需要把向上弹跳的抛物轨迹、落点后摇与空中身位暴露一并管理，而圣杯小姐可以贴地或低空平移完成招架，风险更小、节奏更稳，难度曲线直接分岔。

还有在双人模式里，如果茶杯头带上圣杯小姐护符并产生遮挡，另一名玩家在同屏密集弹幕与平台处理下更容易吃亏。在旧关卡回刷与评级挑战中，角色选择本身就改变了Boss设计原本的意图，让“学会读招/位移换血的爽点”被“更强动作模组的省心效率”取代。圣杯小姐拥有更安全的招架与翻滚，在需要频繁“跳台+招架+还位”的节奏里，另一位仍用茶杯头/马克杯的玩家更容易掉节奏，更多挨打。

并且双人本就有“弹幕密集、队友身体/亡魂遮挡、复活粉心判定挤占视野”的老问题。在dlc里，投射物与背景的低对比度，boss花里胡哨复杂重复化的动作以及圣杯小姐的大招I和新武器的攻击模组更加对第二人带来分心与遮挡，特别是对Boss细微起手的读取和对投掷物位置的把控，前者的身位与射线、EX特效、击中特效、倒地亡魂的粉心复活动画，都会在特定弹幕密度下遮住关键像素，复杂的呈现效果导致人脑对多处动作图像的处理更加费劲，部分Boss阶段存在投射物、地形机关、背景动画、屏幕滤镜同步堆叠的情况，有效信息与装饰信息难以一眼分层，击中反馈/受伤反馈相对略显温柔，血量/进度严重缺乏直观条形提示。

总之，MDHR在没有优化前有缺陷的基础上，不断创造新的缺陷，将dlc双人模式下的整体体验感极大的降低，垃圾茶杯头。

In Cuphead’s core two-player mode, only one player can choose Ms. Chalice, and she comes with four built-in charms: double jump, dash-parry, invincible roll, and +1 HP. Meanwhile, Cuphead/Mugman are still forced to make a painful choice in a single charm slot. Even worse, in the King’s Leap (King’s Castle) stages, the one unique charm they can normally rely on is disabled, but Ms. Chalice’s built-in charm abilities remain unaffected. This effectively lowers by a full tier the original three-button synergy challenge built around “jump–dash–parry–positioning,” fundamentally changing the pacing and counterplay windows for many bosses. For example, when pink parryable objects move parallel to the player, parrying was originally impossible; with Ms. Chalice, it becomes doable. In some stages, large numbers of pink objects can only be parried in parallel motion.

The DLC clearly designs the “parry-only” King’s Leap fights around Ms. Chalice’s dash-parry. When attempting them with the original Cuphead/Mugman, players must manage an upward parabolic jump trajectory, landing recovery, and aerial hitbox exposure all at once; Ms. Chalice can perform low or ground-level parries with far less risk and a steadier rhythm, splitting the difficulty curve entirely.

In two-player mode, if Cuphead equips Ms. Chalice’s charm and causes visual obstruction, the other player, under dense on-screen bullet hell and platforming demands, is at a significant disadvantage. In revisiting old stages or going for high-rank challenges, the choice of character itself changes the boss’s original design intent—turning the satisfaction of “reading patterns/trading hits through skill” into the easy efficiency of a stronger movement kit. Ms. Chalice’s safer parry and roll mean that in sequences requiring frequent “platform–parry–reposition,” the Cuphead/Mugman player is more likely to lose rhythm and take more hits.

Two-player mode already suffered from the long-standing problems of “dense bullet patterns, teammate body/ghost heart revival blocking view.” In the DLC, the low contrast between projectiles and backgrounds, the bosses’ flashy, overly complex and repetitive animations, along with Ms. Chalice’s Super I and new weapon attack modules, further distract and obscure the second player—especially in reading a boss’s subtle startup frames and tracking projectile positions. The lead player’s body and shots, EX effects, hit effects, and ghost heart revival animation can, at certain projectile densities, hide key pixels. The complex visual presentation forces the brain to work harder to process multiple moving images at once. Some boss phases stack projectiles, environmental hazards, background animation, and screen filters simultaneously, making it hard to visually separate meaningful cues from decorative noise. Hit feedback and damage feedback feel relatively soft, and health/progress is seriously lacking in any straightforward bar display.

In short, on top of pre-existing flaws they never fixed, MDHR has kept creating new problems, massively degrading the overall co-op experience in the DLC. Cuphead DLC essentially is nothing more than garbage.",False,0,0,1755120757,N/A,Steam

Story writing is cut above the rest of AAA open world RPG games and makes you feel like your choices actually matter.

Movement feels smooth and fluid (admittedly I did go for double jump & dash every playthrough XD) and the gun play is solid with a variety of playstyles made to support multiple playthroughs (on my 6th so far).

         [td]Gameplay[/td]
         [td]3[/td]
         [td]The gameplay is fine for a first-person shooter. It is uninspiring and, based on your preferences, is either the run-of-the-mill cover-shooter or infiltration-style with basic sneak elements. Likely because Red is excellent at third-person combat, this did not come naturally to them. Considering that this is their first run at it, it is decent enough. [/td]

         [td]5[/td]
         [td]Whew. V and Jackie Welles, man … If you know you know. I rarely see Keanu Reeves as anything but Keanu Reeves, as if his characters are all literally just him, but this time it was all Johnny Silverhand. He rocker-boy’ed the ever-living cyberpsycho out of that character. Endings are all superb, and left my gut hollowed out. [/td]

         [td]Interaction[/td]
         [td]3[/td]
         [td]Just about everything is interactable, which does wonders for the immersion. Not much more to say, though. It does not immerse you in the way for instance Kingdom Come: Deliverance would, but it is still great[/td]

     [tr]
         [td]World Design[/td]
         [td]3[/td]
         [td]I loved driving around in the game, as I could finally scratch that Bladerunner itch I have had for years. There are different biomes and areas in the game, but ultimately, they all have the same flavour to them. The Badlands are dusty, Night City is neon and grime, and that’s it. There’s nothing wrong with it, as I loved it myself, but there is a relentless one-ness to all of the world that almost defeats the immersion. It can be a lot. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
         [td]Music Score[/td]
         [td]2[/td]
         [td]I must rate this based on how much I have been humming the soundtrack post-playing, but I am loathe to admit I cannot remember a single track off of this game. I love the cinematic, swelling music, but this rarely comes out as there are plenty more scenes with heavy fighting pairing equally heavy music with it. [/td]
     [/tr]
  [tr]
         [td]Had-fun-ness[/td]
         [td]4[/td]
         [td]I was not bored for a second playing this game. It was a JOY from start to finish in terms of the story. Doing all of the cyberpsycho missions and all the other side-quests for smaller characters rarely felt like it was worth it, though. The “main” side-characters are brilliant, but otherwise the quests felt like a “meh”, after which I could move on to the next big thing. Still lots of fun. [/td]
     [/tr]
     [tr]
         [td]All in all[/td]
         [td]3.5 / 5[/td]
         [td] I rarely experience a game that so completely absorbs me into its world, and I do believe this is [i]Cyberpunk[/i]’s main strength. I cannot remember the last time the only thing I could think about was a game. It literally affected my job in that I called in sick just to finish it in one go – absolutely no regrets there. The story is simply one of the best campaigns I have ever had the joy of experiencing: gut-wrenching, funny, intriguing and compelling. Themes of transience, belonging to the world for a brief moment, and pondering what is left behind in the wake of one’s death. These are questions that affect us all, and for better or for worse, we must come to terms with our answer to them at some point. This game feels like an offering to do just that in a world that might actually be our own at some point. Gameplay-wise, the games does leave something to be desired. Still, I liked the means and nature of the traversal through Night City, the content of the quests, and even the somewhat janky combat. Johnny Silverhand and V are incredibly well-written characters, and I could finally live out my fantasy of living in a world as Rick Deckard or in the Night City of [i]Neuromancer[/i] [/td]

After fully completing Cyberpunk 2077—and I mean 100% achievements on Steam, every last one—I can confidently say this game has evolved into something truly special. What started as a rough, ambitious dream has transformed into one of the most immersive and emotionally powerful RPG experiences I’ve ever played.

Night City isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a living, breathing beast. Every street corner feels handcrafted, every shard adds to the lore, and every gig has its own flavor. The world rewards exploration in a way few open-world games do.

The storytelling? Absolutely top-tier. V’s journey, whether played cool, chaotic, or compassionate, hits hard. The writing, the branching choices, and the weight of consequences make every decision feel meaningful. And after finishing Phantom Liberty, I genuinely felt like I’d lived through a cyberpunk thriller.

Gameplay-wise, the overhaul patches and 2.31 update turned the combat into a fluid blend of gunplay, hacking, and cyberware insanity. Maxing out builds and chasing achievements kept me hooked long after the main story.

And earning that “all achievements completed” badge was a satisfying ride—some were challenging, some were hilarious, and some made me explore corners of Night City I would've otherwise missed. But together, they proved how much depth and detail the game truly holds.

If anyone still wonders whether Cyberpunk 2077 is worth playing in 2025:

Smite 2,1091500,20.99,17,solo,RPG,76561198069243421,"This game is a perplexing mix of great story moments and awkward dialogue. A very satisfying game play loop and cookie cutter side missions. An incredible hand crafted world and immersion shattering bugs. 

It has come a long way from its disastrous launch with all of the game breaking bugs ironed out. I haven't experienced anything on the level of the T-Posing, game crashing, or random nudity that made headlines in the first months of this game's release but there's still an extreme lack of polish in many areas. The prime example is the driving. AI drivers will randomly stop in the middle of the street. Pedestrians will walk out in front of your car like a new hybrid of oblivious humans and suicidal deer. Any time you come to an intersection is a coin flip on whether you will pass through unharmed or be struck with a wanted level as you T Bone someone whose green light went straight to red as the game detected a player character approaching a stop light. Auto drive only compounds these issues as your car struggles to navigate the incredibly complex problem of a car being next to you when you need to make a left hand turn. I wish I could see my character's wanted level from the NCPD, as the amount of traffic violations and vehicular manslaughter that have been committed on the altar of trying to refill my drink while autopilot takes me on a two minute drive have turned me into the automotive equivalent of the night stalker. Truly this is a world where the forces of Big Sobriety have lost the war on drunk driving, as a DUI is far less dangerous than trusting your life to the hands of Tesla's Thalidomide baby. 

The story is the game's shining achievement. In true Cyberpunk fashion it is a tragedy written on chrome leaf paper. V races against the clock as an experimental new chip is rewiring their brain. And this macguffin comes with a jaded rockstar/terrorist in the skin of Keanu Reaves, who delivers a compelling performance as Johnny Silverhand. As you progress along the path of the world's first voluntary lobotomy, the supporting cast become entangled in your plight and vice versa. Unfortunately, while the side characters can be quite compelling during their missions, everyone you meet that isn't directly related to the main story drop off after finishing their quests. In most games this is expected but in Cyberpunk all of the side characters' lives are dramatically influenced by V (for better and worse) with most of them coming just shy of declaring their love for V as the person who brought them from the edge of their individual despairs to the turning point of getting their lives back on track. But once the last mission of their side plot is complete, you won't hear from the characters organically until the end of the game. I would suggest saving some of these missions for later in the game for a more cohesive story that doesn't abandon the best parts of the story in the second act.

While the characters are well written and a highlight of the story, the dialogue system leaves a lot to be desired. Anyone familiar with Bethesda games will recognize the dialogue tree, helpfully separated into blue options that add more detail and yellow options that will affect the conversation, but the style of dialogue system isn't the only genetics that the games share. Characters awkwardly walk to their stage positions before continuing conversations and speak with their hands/bodies in a way that would make disney animatronics embarrassed. Maybe it's a statement on the way cybernetics push humanity into a cold, robotic existence or maybe rigging is more complicated than the developers were given time for after multiple launch delays, who can say? But even if you can overlook the inorganic posing and positioning of characters in scripted dialogue scenes, it is much harder to ignore the game stuttering to load the next string of dialogue options once character's stop talking. You can almost hear the gears grinding like a 16 year old learning to drive stick as the characters sit in awkward silence until the game jolts awake and finally brings the dialogue menu back up so V can respond. The fact that so much of the gaming community were outraged by Fallout 4's dialogue wheel of ""yes, sarcastic yes, more details, and no"" but haven't mentioned Cyberpunk's wheel of ""yes, yes but pay me, yes but in the tone of V's background, and no"" is either the result of CD Projekt's otherwise well written story winning players over or the original release being such an unmitigated disaster that players have succumbed to the same logic as abuse victims rationalizing their partners constant gaslighting and emotional abuse by saying ""well at least they don't hit me anymore."" On a second play through the mask falls even further as it becomes clear that many of the dialogue options elicit a response that is generated from the following formula: [Player's Chosen Dialogue]=[Brief Acknowledgment of Chosen Dialogue] + [Statement the NPC will say regardless of Choice of Dialogue]. This is especially apparent if you select a different background in a new play through as NPCs pay lip service to the idea of addressing your unique perspective before moving on to what they would have said should you have just selected the ""yes"" option. These issues combine to dialogue that feels as stiff and inhuman as a David Lynch film but without the shield of auteur sensibilities to hide behind.

The gameplay loop is simple but extremely satisfying. It has the same bones as Far Cry 3/4 and Fallout 3/4. Go to a place, have an unexpected and often slightly absurd new variable added to the problem, kill everyone in sight and loot their corpses. But it's the way the game allows you to end the lives of your fellow man that scratches the homicidal itch in my lizard brain that keeps me coming back. My first V was a quick hacker that only entered rooms after melting someone's cyberware and exploding a nearby radio from the safety of a CCTV feed. And while the game starts you with fairly innocuous quick hacks like ""reboot optics"" or ""overheat,"" eventually you unlock such war crimes as ""Cyberpsychosis"" or ""Suicide."" My second V is a close range shotgun/katana wielder with a military grade Sandevistan and Optical Camouflage allowing me to shotgun a room full of scavs and reach the other side before their grey matter does without raising an alarm. And each build has enough unique weapons to guarantee a unique overpowered build is always available. In that way it succeeds in the way Far Cry 3/4 did; with the first half of the game being spent leveling up to be an unstoppable killing machine and the second half of the game just being an unstoppable killing machine. It adds an incredible layer of satisfaction in picking a dialogue option that equates to ""I will instantly kill you"" and being able to immediately back that threat up by turning the person V is threatening into a pink mist before they can utter the first syllable of their witty comeback. 

Overall, the game is difficult to recommend. There is an amazing game here buried inside a considerably clunkier one. It's death by a thousand cuts, starting out with the naive optimism that the bug or awkward dialogue was a one off issue or just an unlucky glitch most people won't experience. But eventually that gives way to the understanding that these are larger problems stemming from the shaky foundation that game was built on. The knowledge that however you customize your V, there won't be enough character there for NPCs to react to. An understanding that for a game about leaving your mark on Night City and dying a legend, that the legend was rigged from the start; and for as often as the game comments on V's growing notoriety and status as one of Night City's most infamous edgerunners, you will always be overshadowed by the exploits of your drugged out imaginary friend.

The environments are visually stunning and, through the deep, hidden lore, perfectly convey the feeling of a world facing extinction. ​Exploration and Level Design: Though the world lacks the seamless interconnectedness of Dark Souls 1, each separate area is designed like an intricate labyrinth, full of shortcuts, secrets, and appealing optional locations. ​💀 Weaknesses (The Bad) ​Visual Repetition: Some areas and enemies feel overly similar to previous installments or even Bloodborne, slightly diminishing the sense of visual innovation. ​Relative Linearity: The structure of the game early on is a bit more linear than its predecessors, which might offer less freedom of exploration at the very beginning. ​✨ Conclusion ​Dark Souls III is an essential action RPG. If you are looking for a brutally hard but incredibly rewarding challenge, deep and ambiguous lore, and combat where every victory feels truly earned, this game is the best option. It might be a tough starting point for newcomers, but for veterans, it is the ultimate homage to the series. ​May the flames guide thee, Ashen One.",True,0,0,1764102000,N/A,Steam

The atmosphere created by the visuals, audio, and story for you as the main character are unique to the souls like genre. The gameplay is incredibly challenging for those that do not normally play, or are unfamiliar with souls like games. But it is worth all of the frustration and struggling to be able to claim and learn from this game and the rest of the series.

The story teaches you, the ashen one, to not dare go hollow in your pursuit of rekindling the first flame. The constant struggles of relentless fighting throughout the story create a sort of suffering that you as the player learn to persevere through. The most important lesson I have found in my journey wasn't patience, precision in rolling, or controlling my own anger. The most important lesson was the suffering from this game. After my first playthrough I realized that it's okay to find meaning in the constant torment and suffering of dying, but it's not okay to find purpose in it.

They fixed and unfixed many of the issues with Dark Souls II.
They kept power stancing, because it obviously makes sense to include that. They also added weapons which were made specifically to be used with both hands, like the Sellsword Twinblades and the Drang Hammers. But obviously, the coolest one is the Farron Greatsword. Its name doesn't make much sense considering that it's a dagger and an actual sword, but hey, cool, regardless.
Which is why it's so dumb that they made the player character mainly right handed, just like in the first Dark Souls. For example, holding an axe in your left hand makes you block, and you can only do a heavy attack with it. Meanwhile, if you have a shield in your right hand, you start punching with it. In Dark Souls II, your character is ambidextrous, however, sometimes you deal less damage with the left hand.
As for the story, areas, and story, the game tries its hardest to emulate Dark Souls 1, from the main quest to the ending, the boss designs, and the levels.
Crystal Sage is just Pinwheel that's not too easy. Old Demon King is just Demon Firesage from DS1. Wolnir is basically Gravelord Nito, again, from DS1. Yhorm the Giant has to be defeated with the Stormruler, a weapon from Demon's Souls, used specifically to defeat the Storm King, a boss fight, that is actually really fun with a cool setting. Dragonslayer Armour is basically the Penetrator from Demon's Souls. Champion Gundyr could be a different version of Iudex Gundyr that the developers thought would be cool, but couldn't decide on which one to put in the game. Soul of Cinder is literally the the Burnt Ivory King from Dark Souls II's Crown of the Ivory King DLC. Same moveset, almost the same attacks. As for the DLCs, Halflight is, again, literally just the Old Monk from Demon's Souls with the same invasion gimmick (which is quite cool). Then Slave Knight Gael, who is a red Artorias.
Areas: Firelink Shrine, same name and function as DS1, but a different setting. I like this version more. Farron Keep => Blighttown. Catacombs of Carthus => Catacombs from DS1. Irithyll + Anor Londo => Anor Londo. Grand Archives => The Duke's Archives. Untended Graves is funny because there's an extremely difficult out of bounds glitch where you can climb up backwards from Cemetery of Ash to reach the illusory wall to reach Untended Graves, but I think you'd get stuck as you probably can't enter the fog wall from the other side (at least in DS2 you couldn't do that), but if you drop back down you'd arrive in Untended Graves. Archdragon Peak is great, especially the Nameless King, I'd say he's my favourite boss. Kiln of the First Flame, same name as in DS1. Painted World of Ariandel => Painted World from DS1. So the pattern here is to evoke an emotion from the better designed game, DS1, by copying everything they can, but making them much smaller, and making them look just as terrible as they were in DS1, because of technical limitations.
More about the bosses (and the enemies), oh dear. It seems like they just tried to make them difficult for the sake of it. They all aggressively ambush you in hordes, as if this was Left 4 Dead or something. Two perfect examples of creative bankruptcy are the Deacons of the Deep and High Lord Wolnir. The deacons are just enemies spawning infinitely without giving you any room for movement at all, and the first stage of the fight is just some collective soul that you can only deal an exact amount of damage to. Then the second stage which is just a crowd crush simulator. Then there's Wolnir, a hard to reach boss with incredibly high defence, whose weakness are his bracelets. He may or may not spawn skeletons just to make things harder for you. Then there's the mist around him, which can make reaching the bracelet on his right hand challenging, because it pretty much instantly kills you. If he starts moving upwards, you're basically dead. Dragonslayer Armour can be pretty difficult by itself, especially because you're fighting on a bridge, and then for some reason the level designers also decided to put some monster in the sky to shoot at you during the second phase. Why? The rest are fine, I guess. It'd be silly to complain about attacks with weird timing. They're annoying, but they're fine.
Magic works the same way as it did in Demon's Souls, meaning you have a mana bar, that you can refill with items (here, mainly the Ashen Estus Flask). I like this one more than the system in DS1 and 2.
As for armour, this is the only game in the series where you can't upgrade armour. Which is sad for cosplay builds, as now you have to choose between high defence or fashion. Meh.
Weapon infusion also works the same way as it does in DS2, which I'm quite fond of.
As for PvP, there aren't really any OP builds like in DS1, but it's still just as unforgiving. Parrying is more difficult (with regular shields?) and rolling i-frames are longer. Parrying would be fine with latency, but dodging with server delay just makes fighting a nightmare. At least you can FINALLY invade without being embered/in human form. Thank GOD.

IM not recommended to run DS at all IF you already run Elden Ring before.
Imagine that you have MacBook Pro 2025 or M5, then you turns on Macbook Air 2010 which one is actually is the PREVIOUS version of your device. Not the different, but previous. Which includes less comfortable, less capable, less frendly UI, less CPU, less SSD speed, less vibrant / crisp picture and ect,
The guys who wrota bout DIFFERENT games:
For example Sekiro was created at the zero point. All animations, assets, colours and ect. Everything in this game was created from nothing.
But HERE, Froms using the same animations, UI, materials and all from the previous versions.
Nothing to say about play this game in 2015.
But in 2025 it looks really BAD in ALL points, which has been improved or cutted off in Dark Souls 4.

Better buy Elden Ring and enjoy last version of ""your MacBook"".

-Enable VSYNC/Shader Cache - unlimited in Nvidea control panel
-Set affinity in Task Manager (uncheck CPU 0; I also followed a suggestion to disable all even-numbered CPU cores, to no avail).
-Disable “Device Association Root Emulator” under “Devices By Connection” in Device Manager
-Disconnect bluetooth devices, plug in directly via USB
-Set graphics settings to low/medium/high
-Update drivers 
-Set Screen Mode to Windowed
-Run DarkSoulsIII.exe in Windows 8 Compatibility Mode
-Rollback on older patch
-Disable/stop Windows Management Instrumentation
-Disc usage under 50% (storage capacity at ~30% usage)
-Install Proper PC Experience from Nexus

FPS [i]still[/i] drops to 27 or 57 - usually in double intervals, seemingly at random (even while leveling up character, in menus or mid battle)

That's it! I'm serious! Want proof? Look up the mod on nexus ""Easy Souls"" and by just understanding how it works, you'll get what I mean.

Secondly, this game is HIGHLY Telegraphed. By which I mean that there's no way for you to ""fix"" any prompt or input you make unless the action resolves; You press to attack> You lift your arm to complete the animation and that's it. Same as the enemy!

You can't dodge midway

I beat Pontiff by dodging on 3rd try and Champion Gundyr on first, despite them being designed for parry. If I had to waste 20 on Nameless Peasant, that's a game's problem. I'm either right or right here.

P.S. Bonus points for giving King of the Storm the same breath attack as the ancient dragon in DS2 and still having the exact same broken ass mimic hitboxes in all three games. Not objectively bad craftsmanship at all.
I swear no mediocre dev team in history was carried as hard by a great composer as FromSoft are by Yuka Kitamura.

Edit:adding Friede to the list of bull. 3 phases and actually infinite stamina in the third? All you've proven is that you have no imagination left. 4th try.

Edit2: oh man. Why did I even keep playing... Midir makes them not even mediocre. Imagine REPEATING DS2's DLC design philosophy. And adding awful camera. Also ancient dragon's breath attack again. Talk about creatively bankrupt.

Edit3: Slave Knight Gael. It's amazing what you can accomplish if you let the guy who made Artorias in the first game out of the basement. 4 tries.

Overall, thank you, Dark Souls III. You saved me some money and a lot of time. Because the studio that made this couldn't possibly make even a decent game in Elden Ring. And music I can listen to on YouTube.",False,2,4,1760870904,N/A,Steam

I hate it and its just not fun.

I wanted so badly to play this and see why people love them so much. 
I killed 6 bosses back in 2021 and came back to give it another go... and I'm barely onto the 3rd boss and I just have zero fun in playing. Its causing me so much stress.

I know the elites out there will get up on their high horses and tell me I'm just bad, but honestly, its just not worth me hating my game time to get through this.

There is a whooping total of 4 bosses, 2 of which you will see every run. There are no random powerups which would introduce any kind of fun rng or broken synergies. Instead the only thing that's somewhat random are the weapons and 90% of them play nearly the same. This makes it so each run feels exactly the same as the previous run. It also makes shops kinda useless and not exciting. In Hades each shop brings excitement, because you know that you will get something good. Meanwhile here shops will at best slightly improve your weapons stat-wise.

I'm sure the game gets at least slightly more varied with the DLCs, but that should be the base experience. Even less known roguelikes like Skul provide more variety.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Bosses are well designed and combat is addictive. The semi metroidvania aspect is an interesting choice and I had fun for a few runs, but if a roguelike gets stale after 5 runs then maybe it shouldn't have been a roguelike.

It's simple enough to not require a tutorial, but the level design provides enough difficulty and depth for it to feel whole. There is no randomness to blame, no enemy to insult, only you, your actions, and the game.

The ""Psychological Horror"" tag feels at home. This game will feel like torture until you become numb to it all. You will go from anger, to boiling rage, then depression, followed by apathy, and eventually, happiness.

What awaits you once you reach the Babe as spoken of in legend? The end of your journey, hardly something from which one can derive enjoyement. It will make you feel hollow, as though the game had plucked one of your organs and won't give it back, as though a part of you had left forever.

The true reward lies in the mindset. Your ""MOTHERFUCKER!!"" turning into a simple ""Welp."", the tightening of your grip on the controller becoming weaker and weaker, the smirk that replaces the deadpan expression you had upon hearing ""Schlap!"". It's the embrace of failure as a just another step taken to get through this pilgrimage, with ""forwards"" and ""backwards"" melding together, bearing the name ""towards"".

Demon Turf,1061090,12.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199131680251,"In a lot of ways, this is similar to Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. However, Jump King fixes many of the core flaws of GOI, leading to a far more enjoyable experience overall.

- The controls are perfectly consistent. If you stand on the same part of a platform and make the same button inputs, your character will always perform the same action, 100% of the time. This is far, far better than the shit show that is GOI, where performing the same action can give vastly different results. It also means that once you learn what you need to do to beat an area, it's fairly easy to recreate what you did and get back to where you were.

- There are no physics bugs. You don't need to worry about your sledgehammer getting stuck in a wall, or being thrown across the map at high speeds without meaning to.

- The map design isn't deliberately cruel. In fact, I'd argue the design is quite generous. In most cases, a failed jump will just knock you back to whatever platform you jumped from, letting you try again immediately. In other cases, there are additional platforms added specifically to stop you falling too far. Sure, if you fail consistently or in a big way then you'll lose progress, but it's often not too much. Again, this is a lot better than GOI where most areas are designed with the sole intent of sending you back to the start of the game and stripping you of as much progress as possible.

- You don't have to listen to Foddy's pseudo-intellectual comments about how failure and overcoming challenges helps you grow as a person. Shockingly, making a game specifically to piss people off and waste their time doesn't make for a great learning experience, and it doesn't make you a revolutionary philosopher. Jump King has an old man at the bottom who makes small jokes about the lore of the game, occasionally mocks you, and sometimes gives words of encouragement. It's funny, fits the game, and once you get past the starting area you don't even need to deal with it anymore.

Demon Turf,1061090,12.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198322217734,"Do you remember playing your first platformer as a kid? There was a disconnect between what you wanted to do and what your character was doing, every step was a small victory, a challenging jump would make your heart race. You would fall, fall, and fall again until eventually, like an angel, your dad or your older sibling or your friend's dad or your friend's older sibling would beat it on their first attempt—and all of that, just the first level. And finally, hours, days, or even years later, you would beat it yourself. 

For me, that game was[i] Scooby Doo! Who's Watching Who [/i]on the Nintendo DS. Now if I was to go back and replay SDWWW I would probably slam through the game and beat it in a couple hours. I wouldn't even think twice about the first stage. I have become the older sibling, the dad, the angel. 

But isn't that a little sad? Don't you miss that adrenaline-dopamine cocktail coursing through your little veins you used to know so well? When every corner you turned you would pray for a checkpoint, only to be met with—in absolute horror—a section that looked meticulously designed to ruin your day?

Jump King manages to gamify the experience of improvement. It feels like when you first fell in love with going to the gym. Or when you picked up your favorite instrument for the the first time. Or like you're five years old again, playing Scooby Doo on the sticker-laden, family DS. Only it doesn't take years to build your fine motor skills, it takes a few hours.

I'm here to tell you that it is so much more.

The game's controls are simple, you can only jump left, right or straight up, as well as walk left and right. You must use these tools to get from screen to screen to the top of the world and find yourself a smokin' hot babe. As soon as you start to play, you will realise just how this game can go from simple to nail-bitingly hard. 

Counter to all modern platformers, there is no air control, and jumps are determined by holding the button down to charge its power, increasing its range and velocity. once you have leapt into the air, you are at the game's mercy, and your punishment for a poor jump can send you back multiple screens worth of progress if you aren't careful. However, I never found the challenges to be unfair. Towards the second half they start adding some environmental hazards, from strong winds that push and pull to icy slopes that will shoot you right back down from whence you came, and these hazards are always introduced in a fairly easy to grasp manner, before pushing it to its limits by the end, never lasting longer than about 5 screens. 

Where Jump King stands tall (or rather, jumps high) above other contemporary games of unforgiving challenge is, well, it is forgiving. there are no checkpoints to save your progress, but there's also no lives, and no hazards that instantly kill you to send you back to the beginning or enemies to get in your way. The controls are strange by modern standards, but not poorly made, they feel buttery smooth to control, and you only get more adept at them the longer you play. the only one to blame for your mistakes is yourself, and falling down the tower has but one recourse; climb back up.

Combine this with its beautiful art and sound design, and this game is closer to a gentle, almost ethereal learning experience. Jump King will teach you patience, humility, and above all an enjoyment of the little things. You just landed a tough jump and made it further than ever, and you deserve to feel good about it. Conversely, there's nothing to worry about by falling. You made it up there once before, you can certainly do it again.

As of this review, I've only beaten the Main Story. That's right, there were two extra sets of levels added after release, much harder than the main scenario, as well as a huge plethora of fan-made content through the workshop, from levels to new looks for your little character. I don't think I can recommend this game enough for people looking to challenge themselves as well as a gentle game for people like me, who love to have something to play while they listen to video essays online.

[h3]the bad part[/h3]

before [spoiler]the chapel[/spoiler] the game is just boring, not even frustrating
the difficulty balance is non existent and the level design is really bs (random chokepoints in an otherwise easy area, forcing you to do the same thing over and over because the levels are designed to make you fall as low as possible, the game punishing you just for not knowing what to do the first time so you don't even get the satisfaction of getting somewhere new)

[h3]the good part[/h3]

after you get to [spoiler]the chapel[/spoiler] the game is actually really fun
the difficulty is actually balanced, you don't get singular near-frame perfect jumps after 5 free screens, you actually have a chance to save your fall, and even if you don't the game doesn't waste your time by making you fall all the way down, it's a completely different experience

If you're completely new it has a difficult learning curve that isn't helped too much by the developers. It is recommened that you join a friend who has experience to guide you early. It's also currently trying to keep alive both new and old systems of the game to appeal to both veteran and new players alike but neither playerbase are feeling satisfied.

Microtransactions (in the form of cosmetics) are honestly very fair in this game. You can absolutely earn yourself a lot of Brightdust from casually playing the game consistently, but playing as a free player is not the recommended experience, You will be locked out of certain activities, loot, and full world experiences due to paywalls however the DLC regularly goes on sale for around 50% off and at that price is worth it, especially if you dabble in end game activities like raids and dungeons (some dungeons are on a seperate paywall that requires silver and are only purchased in game). I would say the pay-to-win experience is limited but it is there in the form of the paid season pass tree. Previously it minimally impactful the game before Edge of Fate. I personally don't consider owning additional expansion pay-to-win (barring New Land Beyond and its ties to Year of Prophecy)

I still recommend this game to everyone because the Raids and Dungeons blind is some of the best gaming experiences out (3 raids and 1 dungeon are free).

Destiny 2,1085660,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",76561199089372079,"Reason for thumbs up (conditional):

This is a free to TRY game, not a free to PLAY game. You are locked out of roughly 85% of the content if you dont spend money. However, I was able to grab the legacy collection bundle for 90% off (~$8 and change) about a year ago and at that price it is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, sound and music are good and the moment to moment gameplay is fun. I got a couple hundred hours of enjoyment out of it before I stopped playing. You can make this game as sweaty or as casual as you want to make it. In conclusion, if you can get the legacy bundle on the super cheap (epic store has this bundle listed for $11 right now) it is worth it. However....

Reasons for thumbs down:

DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR ANY DESTINY 2 CONTENT. Bungie is arguably one of the worst developers on the planet and these days there's a long list of terrible gaming companies and it takes effort to be at the top of that list. They are most known for:
1) Deleting paid content from customers. They call it ""sunsetting"", most call it theft and false advertising. 
2) Plagiarism multiple times. Most recently for marathon art and a huge settlement on ""sunsetted"" content.
3) Ridiculous corporate greed with predatory MTs, predatory in game currency structures and pay to win bs.
4) In game advertisements and pay walled content.

Negatives for the actual game include the most disorganized ""story"", if you can even call it that anymore, I have ever seen as the first chapters of said story were deleted from existence with the whole sunsetting robbery. They literally have a timeline section in the game, that is buried in menus, to explain the actual sequence of events. 99% of players will not see this and play the different campaigns out of order so none of it makes sense. I thought I was doing it in the right order and I very much did not. The new player experience has to be one of the worst in gaming. Tutorial pop ups at every turn that explain how to shoot your gun, that never go away and will still pop up hundreds of hours into the game but no detail what so ever about incredibly important in game systems like weapon and gear moding. It contains what has to be the worst ""journal/quest list"" in gaming. There will be times where you are completely confused about what the game wants you to experience. Sometimes you will even know what you want to experience and have absolutely no clue how to access it. At times it feels like a menu simulator and the in game group finder is a disaster to the point were the community has all resolved to using 3rd party apps for it.

So, the thumbs up is conditional. If you can get most of the content for under $15 total, get it and enjoy it. Its fun. If you cant get a deal, try out the free nibble of a game until you get irritated with all the pay walls and ads and be done with it. Rob them like they robbed their customers. Hit it and quit it for free.

The biggest one by far was ""WE DO NOT WEIGHT ANY WEAPON DROPS. IT IS PURE RNG, WE PROMISE"". 6 years later, a scientist discovers with a math formula that the weapon drops are actually weighted and have been for YEARS. That is right, for YEARS people were grinding for thousands of hours and often times the drop they were trying to get was bugged at a 0.00000001% of dropping. Bungie FINALLY admits the math is correct from this scientist and their was a bug messing up the drops for the last 6 years. Oops. 

I know first hand, I took a week off of work trying to get an adept palendrome with Rampage Outlaw and spent over 204 grandmaster completions with a buddy and NEITHER of us got a single drop. We literally played 10 hours a day for 6 days straight and not one drop. I knew something was wrong with RNG but people just told me ""stop crying, it is RNG"". Turns out, it actually was a HUGE bug in the RNG that wasted all my time. Haha

However, Sony just paid 3 BILLION dollars for Bungie, they aren't just going to let Destiny die for good. They want to make their money back. They will put D2 on life support and force bungie to develop D3 which will take 3-6 years. Then one day they will come back with D3 to recapture all fans and new ones and that will be the day I jump back in. But until then, it is done. I realized it one day when I was trying to do the newest raid, I waited for hours and couldn't find a team of 6 people to run it. Then it dawned on me that the game was actually dying. The numbers don't lie, people like me have thrown in the towel.

I GENUINELY enjoyed this game so much as I've been through Destiny's lows and highs, met so many friends through LFG's. Though the studio has reach an incredible low as to how they treat it's player base and employees is simply saddening. Before new story DLC drops and they have little events for you to play throughout the season, there were mini seasonal story missions that would build up the story or at LEAST add a little more spice with context to the campaign (before or after) and there was a decent amount of content to rinse and repeat but its honestly all gone to shit. There's no point and no reason for you to get on IMO.

If you want your wallet to be ran to the ground with the studio giving almost nothing to offer besides countless micro transactions, piss poor story and just an absolute disregard to its player base whether it was for those who were in it for the PvP or the PvE aspect of it. 

This really was my go to game whether I hated it or loved it, happy or sad, it I'd always come back to it. Now? Ill stare at my character wishing I got my hours I devoted into this game. The friends I've gained from this game are just something else which I had a clan with but now we just all collectively agree that Destiny has reached its all time low and people are starting to really realize and putting it away until they really begin to care for us.

Only four hours into Disco Elysium and I’m convinced this game is secretly an IQ test… and I’m failing beautifully.
This is the most intellectual detective experience I’ve ever had where half the time I’m solving a murder, and the other half I’m arguing with my own brain about philosophy, communism, and whether or not I should apologize to a mailbox. Every dialogue choice feels like a college exam written by a drunk poet.
The writing is insanely good — like reading a brilliant novel, except the novel occasionally tells you you’re a disgrace and then gives you +1 XP for admitting it.
I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m fascinated, entertained, and feeling weirdly introspective about my life choices.
If the rest of the game is anything like the first 4 hours, then I’m ready to become the most confused genius detective Revachol has ever seen.

It starts of very slow. Frustratingly slow. Then it got rolling a little bit, and I wanted to get through it and know how the story finishes....  I can't ever remember looking up how long a game takes to finish... Because I just wanted it to be over.

Then by the end of it. Being more familiar with all the mechanics (Getting time to advance) I was even contemplating a second play through.
BUT then... Just as the referendum was about to start... My game freezes. (The coppernado is back)  And I can't advance even after looking up solutions on the web. The biggest anti-climax in my gaming life.

So after 50 hours it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
Any tips to resolve the freeze are welcome though. I really want to get to the end.

BUT

The gameplay is ass. It's just pure luck, especially for your first playthrough where you don't know which if the 25 skills are useful (many are VITAL and many are USELESS, at least early on, but the game doesn't tell you this). Often times a failed check will mean you are softlocked unless you want to have your character do truly awful things (like accept that racism is correct or violently bully a nice person). In real life, there would obviously be other options, including the option to just give up. But in the game, if you don't want to just give up and uninstall, failed checks can lead to you being forced to play a truly horrible person doing truly evil things. And that's not really a game I'm interested in playing nor one I can recommend.

I plan to revisit this game at some point, but I will be making EXTREMELY heavy use of a walkthough and save-scumming, as I feel this is the only way possible to play the game without being forced into taking actions that I wouldn't take even in a video game.

So yeah, if you're the sort that can still enjoy a game with heavy spoilers (cause you're going to need them) and who doesn't mind save-scumming or a person who just has no morals and is fine with being truly evil in a video game, there is a lot to like here.

[i]All achievements earned, every side quest completed, every secret, companion arc, and dungeon explored[/i]

[b]Divinity: Original Sin is where Larian found its voice, and it still holds up as one of the most reactive RPGs of its time.[/b]
It is rougher than the Enhanced Edition, but completing the Classic version reveals the blueprint for what would become the studio’s signature design philosophy.

You control two Source Hunters investigating a murder that spirals into a metaphysical crisis. The writing is quirky and full of charm, though tone can shift abruptly between absurdism and apocalypse. Dialogue choices, companion opinions, and even arguments between your two main characters can affect how quests unfold.

[b]Combat is the standout system.[/b]
Turn-based, tactical, and heavily reliant on environmental interaction. Fire spreads, poison explodes, and surfaces chain-react with elemental effects. It rewards experimentation, punishes poor positioning, and scales in difficulty quickly. A 100 percent run demands full mastery of the combat system, especially on higher difficulties.

Exploration is densely packed. Side quests are often multi-layered and easy to miss. Solving everything requires awareness, patience, and sometimes trial-and-error. Inventory management and UI are clunky, but the sense of discovery more than compensates.

This game has some of the strangest and some of the funniest steam reviews I've seen but before I get into that, yes I'd recommend this title. Both my gf and myself have loved this game for years. We played and completed this years ago on 2 player and recently started to play our own solo campaigns. This game has literally hundreds of hours of fun to be had.

Important things to note is that:

* it's turn-based combat
* the devs poured humour throughout the game
* the tone of the game changes very often i.e. way more so than other titles of this genre

I mention this as it's easy to see gameplay or read reviews for this however these three things will kill the game for you or sell it to you.

Okay back to the steam reviews! I strongly suggest if you haven't played this before to ONLY check out the reviews that have 100 plus hours of game play on record because offft a LOT of peoples negative reviews is literally based on things that are figments of their imagination or nothing to do with the game.

So a lot of people down vote because, ""this game is different from another game"" i.e. Divinity 2. Surprising eh? two different games are... different.

Another thing people comment on is the games aesthetics and how they believe it's too ""cartoony"" > why did you buy it then? Surely you didn't just buy something without looking at it?

I've seen reviews that the writers has stated that they, ""understand what I'm supposed to do"" however clearly don't have a clue at all. Sometimes, it's because the thing they are trying to do literally doesn't exist in the game. One example of this is that a reviewer literally wanted to talk to a character that isn't in this game and moaned when they couldn't find him.

Lots of people saying it's too hard or they have no idea what they are supposed to do > pro tip, listen to dialogue and read text. Most of the time - if not all of the time - you are point blank told what to do and where to do it. There is player agency duh but progression is never hidden like these players allude/inform.

I've never read such delusions before.

Don't get me wrong everything is subjective when it comes to the question of ""is this game good enough for you to recommend?"" > I get that. I've just never seen so much dishonesty and/or irrelevance before in reviews. The same could be said about what I'm typing sure, that's cool. I'd disagree - obviously - as I'am typing this as a warning to new comers > skip reviews that have less than 100 hours of play time.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198856879669,"The first time I ever tried this game was on a bad day. Shortly after beginning I got a call from my brother, our mother was in the hospital and I should go see her. He failed to tell me it was a massive stroke and I only found out while standing at the foot of her bed that my mom wouldn't be waking up. That was last year, and every time since then I sat down to play this game I cried. Recently I was able to give it some attention and I'm not sure if this is a case of me being too jaded or if I just had a bad series of sessions because as it stands I do not like this game at all.

I tried to enjoy this game for 35 hours, and for 35 hours the game did not let me enjoy it. I have never in my life played a game that is so full of text that has no meaning whatsoever, from recipe books that have no reason for existing to journal entries that provide zero helpful hints or knowledge, Divinity: Original Sin feels like a game that was meant to be played by people who already know the story, have spent hours reading wiki pages and know what all of the traits/talents/skills do in order to exploit the game's systems.

Obviously there are a number of players out there that have no problem scouring various database pages looking for usable information but to me it feels wrong, like I paid to browse wiki instead of play a game. But if you try to just play the game using the information provided ingame, you'll get absolutely nowhere. Every time I felt like I was making progress the way forward was blocked arbitrarily by a horde of monsters that are far stronger than my entire party. Trying to fight them doesn't work, going around them doesn't work, baking them a cake doesn't work either. My only question is, why? Why give the illusion of an open world and player choice when the game is set up so that the only way to progress is to do it exactly how the developers designed anyway? All of the paths forward except for one are blocked from the very beginning.

All that really needs to be done to get ahead is to follow the main questline, which is easily done by following along on the wiki. You can't follow along ingame because it doesn't differentiate between quest types, so unless you know the quest names or have them written down sequentially you have no way of knowing how far along or if you've even made any real progress on the storyline. Usually the text provided with journal entries could help but Larian decided to be as vague as possible and refuses to mention anything beyond basic ideas, names of some places and people, but never how to go from point A to B. There are misleading directions to neighboring settlements, to the point where one is better off not trying to use the signs provided ingame at all. It is truly astounding to me that a company would develop something like this, where the markers that are meant to assist players are wrong and things like recipe lists contain only flavor text and nothing about ingredients. Adding to this the fact that sometimes you need to repeat conversations with the same NPC before your journal updates and we've got a big hot mess with vaguely written directions.

Combat is the main draw of the game so it does that right at least? Nah, not really. You can cast spells and skills whenever you want but outside of battle field effects do not trigger and there's no way to start a fight pre-emptively, enemies ALWAYS go first. Add to that the fact that field effects will sometimes simply not trigger no matter what, and due to an arbitrary wait time that forces attack animations to ""finish"" well after damage is actually calculated you could find yourself accidentally skipping turns with no confirmation popup. Also expect enemies to always vastly outnumber you, be higher level than your party, and have some way of completely neutralizing your damage output through self heals, buffs, spell immunities and the like. The enemies also have way more AP and can self buff, move, and attack multiple targets with different skills in one turn. When combat goes awry (and it will) there is an option to flee combat, which teleports the character and nobody else to a random waypoint, leaving the other party members to attempt a confusing retreat or die trying. The camera only travels one way when you do this by the way, have fun being disoriented and trying to figure out where your party is while the camera does the best job at not helping I've ever seen.

Speaking of cameras, it seems designed to get in the way of exploring and was often detrimental to my ability to see anything and negatively impacted my interactions with the world throughout my time playing. The only thing I could do to fix it was to zoom in as far as possible during fights so that the camera couldn't possibly impact the action. I ran into several fun glitches where I was unable to target enemies due to the camera angle, and in these scenarios clicking the enemy portrait to target didn't work. I ran into multiple situations in which my straight unobstructed line of sight to my target was somehow broken by an object nearby and the attack fizzled. It wouldn't be an issue but it happens more often than it doesn't, to the point where ranged attacks feel useless. The issue was mostly resolved when switching to melee but still pops up when using skills like Battering Ram unless they're used on a completely flat plane.

At this point I'm 35 hours in and I feel like I know too much about it now to stop playing. Maybe I'm missing something here, maybe it is a good game and I'm mistaking its charms for flaws. I'm going to try and finish it and I hope there's something in here that will make me change my mind but so far I've been trying to find the proper way to thread the needle and even with the help of multiple wikis and random anonymous individuals that have already solved this riddle I'm coming up with nothing but blanks.",False,2,1,1663934239,N/A,Steam

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198012441941,"This game design appears to go all-out for careful combat tactical planning and analysis of strategy. What elements work best against this enemy group? You can (and will) die quite often unless you plan for each combat carefully. Some players will find this rewarding, and that's fine. Unfortunately, I guess I don't fit into that demographic.

From what I can tell of the plot it features mystery solving and some fun quests, but in my first runthrough eventually the TPK rate was too high and I gave up. Oddly enough, the breaking point was at a completely insignificant combat with some zombie animals at a river. It had devolved into a pattern of the gameplay slowing to a crawl as I would stagger through a fight, having lost most of my consumables. I would be reduced to save scumming, not even to win a fight, but to actually win it without having to use up too many of my expendables, so I'd have a few left over for the next Incredibly Difficult Combat. 

A very minor quirk that could have been avoided with more lenient design: in a TBS game, it is not cool to have enemy sprites that move just as you're about to click on them, resulting in a misclick that messes up your entire combat command. At least make it Undo-able if you think the unit animations are so essential to the gamer experience. The only real feedback I've heard even from people who like the game is ""yeah, just be careful when clicking"". Meaning the designer messed up, fans are defending them, and it's now our responsibility to work around the designer's oversight.

Years later, they released an Enhanced Edition where the combat was simplified, and I was able to enjoy that much more, although I gave up on that too near the end, due to a ""you cannot pass unless you have this many MacGuffins"" gate challenge. I realized I'd have to open up a walkthrough and retrace all my steps to find a load of Soul Stones. 

I'm not going to do that.

I found I didn't care much about the plot and I wasn't really enjoying myself in the course of normal play anyway. I was really looking forward to finishing the game and crossing it off my list. And if that's the only pleasure I'm getting, I can do without having to watch a Youtube walkthrough just to experience it. I could have just watched a Youtube walkthrough of the whole game and saved myself the cost of purchase.

Verdict: If you enjoy analysis for its own sake, and a tough combat gives you feelings of achievement for figuring out the right way to survive it, this game is probably going to be enjoyable for you. If not, then consider the Enhanced Edition, which allows you to set the combat to Easy and to focus on the plot instead.

Near the end of the game, there will still be some puzzle type level design that may force you to consult a walkthrough, as they're quite obscure. There is also a ""go back and collect all these hidden things in the previous levels"" gate at the end which caused me to uninstall the game and just watch it on Youtube. You may want to consider doing the same if the rest of the game doesn't interest you, and save the cost of purchase.

I hear that this studio is at the helm of the Baldurs Gate 3 design. If this game is anything to go by, expect the end result to be mechanically slick in execution, but to be geared beyond the reach of casual fans of medieval fantasy.

I wish this game's intro sequence was more like an intro sequence.
You fight in some dungeon skeleton king dies bla bla beach fight then enter a humongus city where youre just wandering around and cant really exit because i assume you need to find 2 more companions to be ""safe"" the journal is lots of reading and in general the game plays like a pretty 3d text adventure game.

But its weird cause the rpg element that the game shines a light on at the start is classes and combat.
and suddenly youre in this huge city and you go from roleplaying mr.general, sir. suddenly you have to reprogram your focus and energy to grab a cup of tea and read a lot and talk to ppl and read the journal and you talk to 1 guy and suddenly 4 new journal entries. which make me feel like im some secretary to these heroes.

all n all its probably me thats at fault tbh. I was expecting some Dragon Age:Origins esc start with a bit more focus as to wtf we're actually are doing and why we are there in the first place. In DA:O you have 1. an origin segment for your class with a pretty interesting story line AND 2. there is a intro segment to the whole game(pre battle where the king gets betrayed) which answers why we are there whats at stake introduces to 4man party combat.
The whole curve to that game makes me more inclined to care about my hero and ROLEPLAY him/her in the narrative world of DragonAge.
Maybe I changed since I played da:o. I dunno. At the dragon age origins time i used to read a lot of harry potter as well.
Maybe I just grew out of reading, maybe I preemptively assume I wont be reading anything worth my time anything new or non cliche. I'll try giving this game a try time and time again and maybe eventually I'll grow to like the narrative roleplay.

This is one of those great games where you think, ""Why didn't I play this sooner?"". Divinity Original Sin 2 (DOS2) is the sequel to the already acclaimed DOS by Larian, who are also responsible for Baldur's Gate 3 and all Divinity games. And it felt so good to play this game right after playing the first one; everything here is better: more lore, more exploration, more skills, and more fun and challenging battles.

The lore is excellent and everything in the game fits together; it's incredible how even the side quests offer more depth. The graphics are better, more detailed; every piece of equipment is more beautiful than the last, and each item adapts to the race—the same helmet, for example, will have a different look for each character when equipped.

Exploration is rewarding. There's no grind here, but it will help you reach the recommended level for the tougher battles, besides opening up alternatives to solve the main quests.

The soundtrack is incredibly good. I recommend choosing Lohse as a companion for a wonderful surprise at the end of her personal quest.

In short, it was more than 200 hours well spent, and I'm rooting for Larian to release the third game with the improvements made in BG3.

Esse é daqueles jogos bons que pensamos, ""por que não joguei isso antes?"". Divinity Original Sin 2, é a sequência do já aclamado DOS da Larian, responsáveis também por Baldurs Gate 3 e todos os jogos Divinity. E como fez bem jogar esse jogo logo depois de jogar o primeiro, tudo aqui é melhor, mais lore, mais exploração, mais skills, batalhas mais divertidas e desafiadoras. A lore é excelente e tudo no jogo se encaixa, é incrível que até as quests secundárias se aprofundam mais. Os gráficos estão melhores, mais detalhados, cada equipamento é um mais bonito que o outro, e cada item se adapta a raça, o mesmo capacete por exemplo, vai ter um visual para cada personagem ao ser equipado. A exploração é recompensadora, não tem grind aqui, mas vai te fazer chegar no level recomendado para as batalhas mais difíceis, além de abrir alternativas para resolver as quests principais. A trilha sonora é absurda de boa, recomendo escolher a Lohse como companheira, para uma supresa maravilhosa no fim da quest pessoal dela.

It’s clear that many ideas later seen in BG3 started here. The story is well written and the characters are interesting. The story is strong, but most of it is told through dialogue and text, so it doesn’t feel as cinematic as BG3. Combat is turn-based, fun, and challenging. The game makes great use of combining elements and surfaces, so there’s always something to experiment with. Most situations can be solved in different ways. The world is full of side quests, hidden spots, and interesting situations. Exploring is genuinely rewarding. The whole game was played in Honour mode in co-op, and it was an incredible experience. Encounters were great and every mistake could be fatal. This game is a great option that is worth playing. It does not have modern cutscenes, but the story is great, fun combat, and co-op mode more than make up for it. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys BG3 or turn-based RPGs in general.

I didn't want to hate it, I bought it when it was in beta, played it a lot.

The combat is awful (people teleport everywhere, positioning means NOTHING, anyone I talk to who likes it just used exploits to avoid it and lies to themselves about it, etc.). The story is really bad, especially if you have no personal ties to the divinity franchise before this installment (and even then you probably won't care for the truly stupid reveals, references, and twists). The characters have the depth of a puddle. Nothing works right.

I like CRPGs. I've always liked CRPGs. Since I've played this game game came out I bought Larian's own BG3 as well, and I believe that to be one of the best games ever. In part, that's because it has 0 of the weaknesses found in this game.

I hope Larian's future endeavours look nothing like this game.

I cannot recommend DOS2 though. It has many flaws and lack of improvements that persist even in Baldurs Gate 3 in a certain extent. 

The combat looks like a chore, the split between physical and magical armor is very underwhelming since it restricts party compositions. Enemies on tactician have like x3 your defenses on same level and you need to kite them, split them, use surface barrels etc to slow them before engaging all at once. The AI is rubbish! They know they have better defense stats so they yolo rushing close to the party without considering their survivability. There are also constant issues with the plane of the game since it has issues with space. Meaning you can be on line of sight of an enemy with just a stair in front of you and game thinks something blocks your path. Same issues with verticality, you cannot aim enemies in many instances from above but they can from below.

Secondly the thieving and QOL hasn't been improved since the previous installment. Thieving is a chore to make money and the UI with so many items has not been improved with a universal inventory tab for all crafting materials. I will finish the game but is nowhere near as fun.

Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198201582389,"Lemme focus on the good first :

-Graphics fully hold up
-Good voice acting
-Deep buildcrafting and lots of ways to approach encounters
-Large and packed open world

The bad :
-The world almost feels too big and not structured at all. You are not told where to go and can just go anywhere, which sounds good but doesnt work since areas arent scaled. You will have a tough but managable fight at one house, then you turn the corner and all of the sudden there are enemies that are 7 levels above you. There is just no rhyme or reason to what enemies you encounter and what magic gear they suddenly pull out of their bag and oneshot you with.

- The game barely saves. I get that I can save myself but I dont want to constantly have to worry and savescum because I dont know if the area or person infront of me will turn out to be a unbeatable shitshow or just some friendly trader.

- The amount of items and buffs and passives are too much. Giving us the option for a lot of build customasation is nice but if I need to make a spreadsheet to keep track of what trader sells what item with what buffs just to compare all of them for 2 hours to then decide to buy an item just for it to become useless because a random rat in a basement has a way better ring stashed for some reason is just dumb. It really just feels like loot-slop.

- Maybe I just missed them but the lack of quick travel points at key points of interest feels off

If you dont have a friend that can somewhat guide you as to where to go and what to look out for you are gonna suffer on your first blind playthrough.

Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198261927560,"Possibly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I did a full two player run with a friend on Classic difficulty, start to finish. After having played through BG3 twice and enjoying it, I expected this game to feel similar. Do not make that mistake.
This game has major balancing issues, but not combat wise, but knowledge wise. If you go into this game knowing and looking up everything, you'll probably clear it all no problem, but going into this game blind will result in you getting your ass handed to you. Surprise encounters out the wazoo, enemy immunities that can screw up a majority of builds, the physical/magical split. Oh and some of the puzzles are absolutely idiotic. Then there's the add-ons, fantastic additions if you don't care about achievements, but if you do, you gotta keep em off, which really sucks given they're all QoL things that exist to make this boring game significantly less frustrating. Want to be able to see ghosts without clicking a button? Tough luck, no achievements for you. Want to replenish a resource that isn't hard to get but takes like 20 seconds at the end of each fight to replenish at the click of a button? No achievements allowed.
Also lets talk about build variety. And how it sucks. Do you want a hybrid magic/physical guy? Enjoy gimping yourself. Heck, do you want half mage half physical team members? Enjoy gimping your team. You pretty much have to go all in on one type by the end of the game because of the game's magic/physical armour health system. Oh and you better hope you get good levelled gear on level, or your armor will be too low and this game becomes CC hell, because almost every ability has an unavoidable CC once your armor is gone.
Also by the end of the game, you better have at least 5 points in polymorph if you want to do anything, cause if you don't, good luck with your builds.
Also civil skills are stupid. Maybe if you got more points it wouldn't be as dumb, but lockpicking eats lockpicks success or failure, same with identifying, so you better have a mask of the shapeshifter or an undead in the party if you don't want to deal with that crap.
Finally, ignoring balancing issues, enemies regularly jumping out of nowhere to fight you, the fact that the game has levelled randomized loot, the weirdly rushed ending to many story arcs and the fact that the game tells you nothing, the game is broken. Numerous times, dialogues that were supposed to happen didn't, things that didn't seem like they were supposed to happen did happen, and my friend and I literally skipped the final boss because the game bugged out, and we just... didn't fight it.
All in all, this is probably one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, that punishes you with disabling achievements for trying to make the game not even easier, but a smoother experience. Also you're locked into your companions for the whole game, so you better like em once you pick em.

-You have to press a button for a merchant to pay you the gold worth of an item / multiple items since it defaults to the player just handing the item to the merchant for free for some inane reason. 90% of the time your are selling crap you picked up to merchants for pure gold so the concept of a balancing offer button isn't needed in those 90% of times.
-There is a search feature to search through your combining recipes which you only sometimes need, but there is no search feature for your inventory, which is INFINITELY more useful with a game that pumps your inventory full of crap constantly. You can only do basic category filtering on your inventory. Why?
-Game's UI confusingly shows you your damage values for equipment BEFORE applying any of your stat buffs if you look at the equipment's stats. The ONLY way to know your basic attack power is to view your character sheet, even during battle. Why would I ever look at my character sheet to see what damage i will do during battle after my stat buffs? YOU ARE HEARING ME RIGHT IT DOESNT SHOW YOU THE DAMAGE RANGE YOUR NORMAL ATTACK WILL HAVE WHEN YOU HIGHLIGHT AN ENEMY TO ATTACK THEM, DESPITE DOING THIS FOR EVERY OTHER SKILL IN THE GAME, JUST WHY
-Selecting an enemy to attack during battle is INCREDIBLY specific to each skill and INCREDIBLY finicky, you will constantly misclick and often feel like you can't even click the enemy you want to click because of their janky click detection. Massive example: literally every single time i use Battering Ram skill it is a struggle to get the game to actually attack a specific opponent rather than try to go beside them, every time i try to use an AOE projectile it jumps my cursor around like a friggin madman to avoid centering on multiple enemies which is always what I would want to do.
-You MUST, MUST combine items by slowly dragging them or double clicking them into some combine UI, waiting for a sound to play, and waiting for 1 item to be made as a result, instead of dragging one over the other and them instantly combining or having a bulk combine feature. Yeah why would i ever want to drag the horn of poisonation (dont care what the actual name is) onto a potion to turn it into a poison flask instead of slowly waiting for a sound effect to play as they combine for the millionth time? I avoided combining things just because the UI was so slow to use.
-Why the HELL can't i drag runes onto armor pieces with empty slots. Instead I must use another UI that adds more clicks to slot things into the equipment. 99% of the game you only have 1 rune slot on armor pieces so it would be braindead simple to implement.
-Why the hell do I have to slowly hover across the overworld to click where i want to go instead of clicking on a spot on the map and let autopilot kick in? I literally can do that anyway by hovering for long enough, you just want to waste my time intentionally or something?

Most of these complaints just add an insane amount of extra clicks for the player and make managing your inventory a complete nightmare even with an automatic sorting function.

other gripes I have are
-Game gives you a talent for talking to animals, 90% of the animals do nothing other than say some stupid crap or tell you to stop talking to them angrily in some way. What a waste of a talent point. You can get a decent shield near the end of the game but it's massively outclassed by other available ones 2 moments later.
-When you enter caves, rather than clicking on the cave entrance itself, you have to click on the rock formation that surrounds the cave entrance. Dunno who could even come up with something that strangely different other than that they were too lazy to do it the way that makes sense.
-Why the hell are some of the battles the most confusing jank shit ever? Your party member was posessed, but you killed them, now they're not possessed, but someone else is, but now they're not, but now they are, but you killed them, now they're not, now their summon is but they're not, but now their summon is but they aren't, WTF IS GOING ON IN THIS FIGHT IT MAKES NO SENSE DEVS
-Constant unexplainable events in battle triggered by jank. Big enemy summons henchmen because we took too long, HENCHMEN ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE BATTLE AND CAN WALK AROUND FREELY AND HEAL ANY DAMAGE WE DID TO THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RIGHT NEXT TO US, AND THEN STAND THERE AND DO NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE BATTLE, THEN DIE WHEN WE DEFEAT THE BIG ENEMY. This is half broken. 
-Fighting in the arena in co-op mode with my friend. One of my characters die during the battle. They announce since we defeated all enemies we must defeat each other next. Friend kicks my ass. Both my characters are now dead. BATTLE ISNT CONSIDERED DONE BECAUSE HE MUST KILL BOTH OF US MEANING HE HAD TO MANUALLY REVIVE MY ALREADY DEAD CHARACTER AND KILL HIM AGAIN. Straight up untested battle situations?!???
-Doing well while fighting Lucian punishes the player by Braccus having full force against them. I love when playing well makes you lose more. Great design that. Dont worry we half-assed it the next try and easily won. Felt ""rewarding""",False,1,1,1761156383,N/A,Steam

This is a negative review because the game has insanely high review scores BUT it has some glaring issues. 

There's a bit of a catch though. It's the fact that I've only become frustrated enough to leave a negative review after multiple playthrough's. This is because I was so pleased with my initial experience that I was willing to overlook the issues back then. I am not willing now. 

The worst issue here is the simple fact that many fights in this game feel borderline unwinnable unless you already know how the fight will go before going into it and take steps to give yourself as much advantage as possible. This doesn't feel like ""tactical"" gameplay and is very frustrating, probably the most of any of the issues this game has. 

The second biggest issue is that you can really easily screw yourself over just because you talked to someone with the wrong character, which btw can be very hard to avoid in certain situations where npc's approach and initiate dialogue after a fight or something. They just go for the nearest npc and you can't well control that. If you are playing with friends, this mostly manifests as the player with the character who has persuasion having to be the one who goes first everywhere to talk to all npc's and see all new areas, otherwise you might fail some essential dialogue option. Feels like it punishes the other players for exploring.  

The rest of the issues have mostly to do with jank or bugs, like quest entries and markers not updating properly (this happens ALOT, but thankfully actual quest progression rarely breaks). But one of my biggest personal issues is the fact that many near-essential game changes that come bundled with the game and were made by the devs are treated as mods and disable your achievements. Like, really? Almost all of them are quality of life improvements that should have just been part of the base game, don't get me wrong it's extra nice to have the option, but not if it punishes you for using them. 

It's a good game, and you probably owe it to yourself to play it if you are a fan of crpg's, BUT it still has issues which may not be conveyed to you by the high review score. That's why I decided to write this.

Ah yes one final thing. Traps in this game are on a limited, short timer, which counts independent of the combat turns. They are fucking useless. Absolute garbage and waste, baffling design decision that I still struggle to comprehend. Normally I love a good use of traps in games like this (Underrail is the absolute king of this plus also stealth) but in this game it is awful.

The writing in this game is severely inferior than BG3.

The lighter, more amusing end of the spectrum includes things like a specific enemy that reliably disappears and deactivates only when you're in its room, the variety of weird issues with item pickup interactions, item and equipment descriptions being unhelpful or sometimes outright wrong, or enemy/boss AI sometimes just deciding to entirely nod off on the job.

On the more frustrating end, we have stuff like the squandered potential of the special boss abilities and vertical maneuvering, the frustrating inscrutability of some of the level design, or the very jarring in-dialogue ""this is the point of no return, turn back if you have other business to attend to"" notice that only actually applies for the duration of a single mission before you can return to the world and do side quests.

An interesting, but mostly linear story, with beautiful graphics and fun combat mechanics.
Personally, I didn't find it as hard as any Dark Souls game, as the mobs, bosses and runbacks are much more forgiving. While playing an entire game without healing is usually a privilege of expert challenge-runners, it is quite feasible in this game to get this rare achievement.

There is a good variety of weapons, ranging from fast and evasive to slow and devastating. With freely configurable augmentations, you can create any build you want, from an enemy-shredding glass cannon to an immovable tank. The ice, fire and electric elemental attacks and defences are a nice addition, too. I've found managing your stamina quite delightful in this game - you can refresh your stamina bar by cooling yourself down at any time, as long as you don't freeze yourself in the process.

The story is fine (3 endings + a DLC that feels more like a side quest), but the real highlight is the **world-building and map design**. The 7 regions are interconnected and layered in a way that makes exploration rewarding and atmospheric.

Gameplay is fun enough — good weapon variety, decent armor sets (though less important than in other games), plus grenades and elemental resistances for combat variety.

* After finishing the game, you *cannot return to your save*, which means no DLC access unless you start NG+.
* NG+ gives you duplicate weapons/armors instead of replacing old ones — clutter and pointless selling.

Pros: 2H heavy mace with special attack that might as well be a shotgun was a lot of fun. Aesthetic of the game is pretty good. once you get the air dash and grapple hook that's pretty sleek too.

Cons: story suggests something more but turns out pretty shallow. game is janky, runs poorly, overly convoluted map layouts, why am I constantly circling where I want to go with simple metal gates or barriers barring my way with arbitrary 'locked from the other side.'  I can jump but many invisible walls above walls that you could easily find a way to parkour over.

Also.... light attacks (R1) and running attacks (R1 or R2) with a heavy weapon all suck. They don't seem to do any posture damage, so even the scrawniest trash mob will hit you in the face if you try to start a fight with a running attack. As a heavy weapon user, this game was all positioning and timing for standing R2 and charged R2 attacks... plus special attack. maybe other weapon types favor more light/running stuff.

Bosses are pretty darn easy. I barely used items. You could spam a boss with frost grenades and just hit when stunned if you wanted to. I stopped using grenades after it made an easy fight even easier.

As far as indie soulslike games go... Thymesia had far less production (no voice acting) and was a better overall game.

super con: ending is dumb as hell. 

spoiler::::: without giving away too much... the bad guys in the game could defeat you at any time if they wanted to and there's no explanation for why they didn't when they clearly want to defeat you... completely not the mechanic, but imagine lex luthor has kryptonite and never uses it against superman. the kryptonite has been THE MOST OBVIOUS solution for the villains the whole time and they didn't use it? what? the? hell?

Le personnage est assez maladroit, voire robotique… :p ce qui me rappelle DS2. En fait, tous les boss m’ont rappelé les boss du début de DS2. J’en ai tué la plupart au premier ou au deuxième essai. Le moveset des boss est manjado (simple) et pas très élaboré. Je n’ai rencontré aucune difficulté dans ce jeu, mais peut-être que le build de force correspond au easy mode ; je suis sûr que cela aurait été plus difficile avec un build d’agilité ou de tireur.

La plus grande difficulté que certains pourraient rencontrer, ce serait de gérer les différents combats contre les mobs ennemis, des ennemis qui ont comme un spider-sense, voient à travers les murs et te détectent même sans t’apercevoir. Autre chose : la limite d’aggro des ennemis est beaucoup trop courte, ridicule ; ils se retournent simplement sur toi. L’IA est vraiment trop stupide.

J’ai apprécié le temps de soin presque instantané (à l’opposé de DS2). C’est bien que le moveset change avec chaque type d’arme, mais il y a trop d’animations ajoutées, ce qui ralentit le combat et le rend vite répétitif. J’ai trouvé le level design problématique, avec TELLEMENT d’arbres, de rochers et d’objets bloquant la vue et ralentissant le personnage. Mon personnage restait souvent coincé ou buggé par des débris, racines ou objets, visibles ou invisibles, au sol du niveau. Il y a aussi quelques bugs agaçants, où il faut appuyer plusieurs fois ou se positionner différemment pour ramasser un objet ou verrouiller un ennemi.

Une chose que j’ai vraiment aimée, c’est l’ambiance d’enquête et de mystère dans le gameplay.
Malgré ses défauts, il faut se rappeler que ce n’est pas un jeu AAA, et qu’il est de meilleure qualité que BEAUCOUP de AAA et même de AAAA qui existent. C’est un GOOD game, et je l’ai apprécié.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561197984506396,"I think this game is a good entry point for someone who likes the Souls formula, but finds it too unforgiving and punishing. It's definitely on the easier side of souls-like spectrum. 

The game actually allows pausing. The items and equipment menus are still live, but there is a pause menu where you can adjust basic settings. Pausing the game also auto-saves, so you don't need to make it to a vestal (bonfire) before quitting out. You can just quit at any point and continue from there.

The game is pretty generous with vestals, so runbacks arent really a thing. There are either a lot of them, or there are several shortcuts back to a particular one, so runbacks aren't as common or as grueling. There's almost always a vestal near the boss.

One common complaint I saw that I just don't agree with is the level design. It's not labyrinthian or hard to navigate at all. Most areas are straightforward. There aren't a ton of branching paths to get lost on. The levels all tend to loop around and give you shortcuts back to where you started. There's a compass you can buy that points you toward various objectives. 

The story is decent. I thought VA was pretty good. Enemy variety is a bit meh, basically everything bipedal and humanoid, which come in flavors of grunt, warrior, elite, and heavy architypes. Some quadrupeds. And stealthy guys. Character customization and weapon variety is good IMO. Overall pretty fun souls-like. Better than LotF, not as good as LoP.

I picked up Steelrising on sale, and for that price, it was worth it. It’s a short and relatively easy game compared to most Soulslikes, but it does have its charm.

The story is simple, easy to follow, and a bit predictable—but still enjoyable enough to keep you moving forward.

The gameplay starts off fine, and once you unlock the main abilities, it becomes very easy to clear levels. Combat feels smooth, but it doesn’t take long before you’ve mastered it and stop needing most of the items the game throws at you.

Bosses are not challenging at all. I beat most of them on my first attempt, which was a bit of a letdown given the genre. The game also holds your hand quite a lot—something I personally didn’t enjoy since I prefer a tougher challenge.

Exploration is also on the weaker side. Most of the time, your “reward” is just a consumable you’ll probably never need. There isn’t much incentive to go off the main path.

That said, it’s not a bad game. It runs well, looks good, and the setting is interesting. It’s just not on the same level as the heavier hitters in the genre.

Its a much more janky and indie version of that, you can see the inspiration of it throughout this game, but after 4/5 hours of the game i think i got a good grasp of it.

Exploration is fun, and with all indie game it is well thought out. Ways to get from point a to b have like 2 or 3 solutions if you know how to work around the weird mechanics, which is cool, but speaking of mechanics, they're bad. And i dont mean, im complaining bad, but they're bad. The jump is weird and the pause at the top of the arc is a little too long, especially when you're in battle.

Pros:
-Very well designed world and locations.
-Every weapon class is unique and some of the designs a bonkers crazy but they dont feel out of place in this clockwork automaton world.
-The game is beginners friendly so if you want to play soulslike games but hate the high difficulties. This one is for you.
-For me the game ran really good. I only play on 1980p and had no technical issues like I read in many of the other reviews.
-The game doesnt overstay its welcome and doesnt feel like a grind and NG+ is worth a shot.

Cons:
Some of the sidequest storylines irritated the hell out of me. Cause they broke immersion of this beautiful fantasy world with current day-isms and its the main reason for my negative recommendation. You dont break immersion for political messaging and virtue signaling. The same would be true if the main character suddenly pulls out a coca cola can out of her cogs and slurps it down while telling us how its smears her gears in the right spot. Allow me to explain these ""woke"" questlines.
- A black slave owner of the colonies yaps about muh racism in 18th century Paris and how he wants freedom for all the slaves in the colonies. I would say thats quite hypocritical. And the funny thing is that another npc calls him out on it and asks him why he didnt set his own slave free. But the discussion and the slaver arguments ends in the way of stfu white boy and check your privilege (not in these words but thats the jist of it). But they keep bringing up the muh racism thing way to much. Black guy speaks during main storyquest plotlines ""but what about muh racism thingie"" is present in one form or another.
- Another ""woke"" storyline is tied to the DLC mission. And its about a female bodyguard who takes every opportunity she has to insult men. Yap about muh womens rights and down with the patriarchy. And that whole conversation felt so out of place. Even your main character suddenly has a more combative voice when its about the current day feminism.

These 2 storylines were so out of place i mean come on. A tyrannical Despot and his lackey build an army of killer automatons to keep power over the people. And they kill as many people as they can to harvest the souls to keep the automatons fueled so that the army can keep on existing. And then we have diversity hire and feminist here yapping about muh racism and female rights. Really? Entire cityblocks are eradicated and covered in corpses and thats your priority?

I presume some of the devs are activists and they had to insert their agenda in the game. Or perhaps some EU or ESG money was rewarded if they made the game more DEI. Nonetheless. That grinded my gears the wrong way and i call it out. Im sick and tired of this crap creeping into our entertainment. Entertain me and stfu. 

And its so sad really cause the rest of the game i really enjoyed and had a great time with. But never give your money to people/companies who hate you and want you gone. A great man once said ""Everything woke turns to Shit"". And he is not wrong.",False,4,4,1760746778,N/A,Steam

Similarly, weapon variety is limited to 9 classes with 4-5 variants using the same special ability pool (block, parry, flurry, ranged attack, and elemental buff).

The gameplay itself is fine if easy. you get to active reload your stamina bar in exchange for a partial freeze buildup. Play hyper aggressive to stagger and crit.  Most bosses went down on the first try.

El parry es DEMASIADO bueno. Es tan bueno y fácil de hacer que puedes hacer parries constantes a los jefes, lo cual lo facilita muchísimo los combates.

Nice weapon and armor selections as you progress through the game. Great graphic style and have no issue with the voice over and dialog. A good game.

What is a pain in the ass, is sometimes in the game in order to west you have go east instead. Or, to go north you first have to go south, etc, etc, etc......

The animations are much too slow to feel rewarding when you don't get feedback from scoring a hit. The frost batons in particular were truly awful to use.

In level design, I think there were some strong points, but the heavy use of groups so early on with enemies whose main difficulty is interrupting your actions made the initial experience more frustrating than I could tolerate.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561199007516405,"Overall, I'd give this game like a 4/10.  
Art style: Incredible, 10/10
Story: Tough to follow, I feel like the focus was on getting French aspects and getting the translations all sprinkled in that the story had a few holes. I feel like there were some choices to make that would have lead to different outcomes like the gunpowder, but I feel like there wasn't enough of an indication of what they actually meant. I filled the gunpowder with water before I even saw the gunpowder. Also how the heck was there so much water to just fill that place? That doesn't make sense. 
The main villain also wasn't super interactive; I feel like he had 2 one-liners to me and then was gone. No resolution with him kind of annoyed me because it hints to another game, that I won't be playing. 
Animation: Enemy styles were predictable and really easy. I shouldn't have been able to walk into any boss battle, including the last one, and beat it first try.  I'm good at souls-like, but I wanted a challenge.  There were a few bugs that caused for unnecessary damage to be taken/ npcs to walk through tables/ glitch.  Also I could run through water for some reason in some places but die from a toe going in in others.  The memory in the orange area near the end did not show the customized Ludia, but rather a default puppet/ machine that threw the story off a bit.
Weapons:  There was a bit of variety which I loved, but realistically, some of them were so weak that it didn't make sense to switch  and buff something up.  
Items: The items were alright, the ones that caused stagger were OP but the rest were just sold. Also, the item locations were BS; why the heck were some of them so hard to get and then they were just a small heal and then the weapons and unique items were right in the open in big glowing chests. 
Equipment: why wasn't there a backstory for the new skills? Like why the heck did I get a dash and a kick out of no where? It made the item less meaningful and didn't really tie into the backstory. It could have been an amazing portion of the story as to how she built her body with add-ons from the creator.

The game has a cool main character
I love the design of the weapons

Cons
The Story is pretty boring and usually not so important for soulslike, but the combat is easy enough that a good story would balance it out
The characters look bad
Level Design is pretty bad
Jumped down in an area once I didn't recognize and had to do a 10 min runback

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198184834473,"Steelrising really makes me wish we had an option in between a positive and negative review. I don't think it's bad I just don't think it's good either, but if asked by a friend if I'd recommend buying it I'd have to go with no. As of writing this review I haven't actually completed the game yet though I am somewhat close, despite the negatives it's not bad enough to drive me away from finishing it; I just wanted to get my main thoughts down while they're still fresh.

The combat in Steelrising is underwhelming. The Overheat and Rapid Cooling mechanics that allow you to nearly have unlimited stamina in succession is quite fun and really allows you to keep up the pressure on enemies; the only issue is that the enemies just are not built to handle this. This game uses the stance break mechanic similar to games like Sekiro and Elden Ring where keeping up pressure on the enemy fills up a meter that will eventually stun them and leave them vulnerable to a critical attack, but the non-stop pressure you have from Rapid Cooling constantly refilling your stamina makes it so just spamming fast attacks will quickly knock enemies and bosses alike over. Enemy AI isn't great either which compounds this issue, I've had several bosses lose interest in fighting me and just stand there, I don't know if this is caused by having so much pressure on them or if it's just like that normally. The game also reuses a lot of regular enemies as bosses, which isn't uncommon in soulslikes but when it's the majority of bosses in the game it gets old fast. Oh, and unlike Elden Ring where you're incentivized with more pressure damage for sneaking in a few charged attacks, the charge attacks suck in this game and are both incredibly slow to charge and not very impactful once you do, so just spam R1 instead.

Aegis is pretty cool being a French robot woman and the setting is neat, though the character building for Aegis lacks any real depth. You pick the one stat for the type of weapon you want to use and crank it, maybe put a few points into extra health or stamina but the game isn't really hard enough to require you to do more than pump damage. Similar to a Metroidvania Aegis gets some upgrades as the story progresses that allows her to go back to older areas and access new locations, though they all really amount to ""press button in predetermined spot to open door with new power,"" and while these abilities can be used in combat, they're all pretty weak and underwhelming to actually use. I'm not a Souls Must Be Soul-Crushingly Difficult elitist but this game is way too easy in the opposite direction, the only times I died was to the environment.

Speaking of the environment, the level design here is... Ambitious? Quite unlike any soulslike I've played. There's a lot of verticality and platforming which I'm actually not against I think it could be cool if done well but I don't think this is it. The levels want to be in that Metroidvania/Dark Souls interconnected style but have so many twists and turns and pathways that you'd never find where to go naturally like you do in those games, which is why Steelrising gives you a compass item that puts a giant waypoint on your screen to guide you; which turns most levels into just sprinting towards a waypoint, running past all the enemies. Of course you don't need to use the compass, but the levels are too confusing to navigate naturally and would take frustratingly long to find out where to go, and it's not like you'll be well rewarded for exploring anyway since most of what you'll find is some consumable you'll never actually use. Even when using the compass it's easy to get lost, like this one area where you need to get across a canal and the compass guides you to a spot where you can jump across, but it doesn't really look close enough that you can make the jump so you may look for another way over, only to eventually realize you just barely can make that jump...

The setting is cool but the presentation of the story is not. You're constantly watching cutscenes of samey looking French aristocrats yapping and none of it is fun or interesting to watch. The cutscenes all have this amateurish jank that makes even the boss cutscenes look kinda awkward.

I got this game from a Humble Bundle with a handful of other soulslike games for $20-ish bucks or something around there, and outside of getting Steelrising a similar way I would not really recommend buying it. Like I said in my opening I don't think this game is bad or anything it's just not... good either.

The enemy design quickly became repetitive, the same basic types reused over and over, just with different elements like fire or frost to make them “unique.” After a while, it stopped being exciting and just felt like a chore.

Once I realized I had essentially hit the cap on weapon upgrades and certain specs, the sense of progression disappeared. That’s when the game really lost me. By the second-to-last area, I found myself just running past enemies instead of fighting them, not because I couldn’t handle them, but because I was simply bored.

Looting also felt unrewarding. Gear upgrades were expensive enough that I never really switched weapons or outfits, so there wasn’t much incentive to experiment. The whole system made exploration feel pointless.

In the end, I didn’t finish the game, not because it was too hard, but because it got less and less fun the further I went. It’s a shame, because the opening hours showed promise, but for me, Steelrising ran out of steam halfway through.",False,3,0,1757187976,N/A,Steam

I just beat the final boss. Heartfelt cutscene. Cue loading screen for post-cutscene cutscene. Game crashes for zero reason. I load back in to find my save right before the final boss. Sure, I'll do it again just for the sake of rolling credits. Except that I go to interact with the lever that opens the door to the final boss arena, and no button prompt. Nothing I can do to get back in and truly finish the game, even if its just final cut-scenes and credits.

If this doesn't bother you, then by all means it's a pretty solid game. Would be a nice and easy introduction into the soulslike (or soulslite?) genre. But both Reddit and Steam have several threads about this issue that seems well reported over three years ago and it seems they can't be bothered to fix such a small minor issue that creates a completely impassible softlock that prevents people from finishing the game.

I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

You can choose between several characters that have their individual advantages and disadvantages while playing the game. The main goal is to reach Maxwell's Door and go through the story.
Or just survive as long as you can and fight the different Giants that might appear in the seasons the game has.

I most played offline, so the hours I spent are much more than shown in steam (I would say about 500hrs?). 
The game is still unique and very special. I like it most, because it is not mainstream and has its own style and feeling.
Nothing is explained and the player needs to figure out everything by themselves.

Interesting to mention is, that you can create your own rules for the world that is created and define what you want to have appeared less or more like certain giants or certain resources.

There are some basic mechanics the game has, which the player needs to understand:

Hunger - your character needs to eat from time to time

Sanity - you need to do something for the brain of your character to get not insane, otherwise the shadow hands and shadow creatures will appear that attack the character

Health - the environment, the creatures, some consumable and too hot or too cold circumstances can heart the character

Light - the light is the protection against the shadow creatures and the player needs to stay in light to prevent beeing attacked by them and losing sanity

Temperature - not visible directly, but it can be too hot or too cold and the player needs to do something to protect against heat and cold by wearing certain clothes or hats or by staying near a fire

Crafting - one base mechanic is to craft things and structures out of the resources (not all are renewable) one found in the environment

Research - you can upgrade your gear and your base buildings by finding the right resources for it and you will need to to survive over time

The fun part is the challenge the game offers to the player. You have a lot of stress the first runs to survive the harsh environment and to understand the game mechanics.
After meeting the first giants you will get a more deep understanding, what survival means, when the burning sun in summer or the shadow creatures that appear when you lost sanity in spring because the frequent rain depleted your sanity didn't kill you until then.

And this is only tip of the iceberg.
There is Adventure Mode in the Story Mode which gives you different gameplay compared to the bare survival
There are different Giants that appear in different seasons
There are the caves you can jump in
There are the add-ons that give almost a completely different gameplay:
 - Shipwrecked with islands to hop over
 - Hamlet with Pig Villages
 - Reign Of Giants with a lot of extra resources and stuff to encounter
And much more

If you like unique survival games with well balanced game mechanics and crafting, you might like this game and I recommend it to you.
If you do not want to learn a lot and you really don't like to start over and over again at the beginning, you might avoid this game.

You can get it on sale for super cheap and I've played this game along with the together version and will continue to do so.

The problem is that the game doesn't tell you how to do anything. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to figure stuff out on your own. But how am I supposed to know that giving meat to a bird in a bird cage enables me to make amazing new food or that bunnymen will attack you just because of you holding meat items, causing me to die 15+ hours into my run. I know dying, learning from your mistakes and starting over is the whole point of the game, but it can get frustrating and repetitive.

Also certain parts of the game like the adventure/story mode are poorly designed in my opinion. It's running around searching for random items on your map for 4 levels, just for you to die on level 5 because you didn't know the final level was in total darkness.

Dont Starve,219740,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",76561198089281190,"This game really sucks, it's just kind of backwards and inconsitently confusing. You wander around and you'll die, you stay still you'll die. The basic items for your character could spawn right next to you or 3 miles away and soft lock your progress for 2 weeks. It's random in all the wrong ways. 

It's keen on pushing you to explore the world but then punishes you for doing so, you have a tiny hunger bar and very few ways to respawn or regain health. Even eating only gives you 1-5 health, the later game foods at least the ones I've tried give you zero health at all. Despite the massive amount of effort put into them. 

It wants you to explore but every ten minutes the lights shut off and you're forced to either a slow crawl with nearly no light or a complete stand still. 

Pretty much any plan or strategy you make is pointless because the items you need for it could be fiften miles away or spawn right next to you. 

Travel is dreadfully slow even with worm holes (random chance to go where you're trying to get.) and paths (double your speed.) 

Every world is stupidly massive, but its hardcore mode no respawns. And with enemies that can easiely one shot you. Why would you ever take the risk to leave your comfy base? Because the devs said so, they'll send as many enemies to pester and kill you as needed to force you to do what they want.

Pretty much the whole game is just random chance, the devs decided to leave it to random chance to enjoy the game. Except the things that ruin your game, its not random when enemies will spawn to come and kill you. It's not random to starve to death. Only things that are enjoyable are random, only progression is random.

Dont Starve,219740,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",76561198095027549,"For reasons I can no longer recall, I bought [url=store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/]Don't Starve Together[/url] shortly after buying this game, so I didn't end up playing this game all that much, as I chose to play with friends instead. However, I decided to revisit this game again recently to see how they compare, and after playing it a bit, I just can't recommend this game when the multiplayer version exists.

This game is very similar in many ways to the multiplayer version. Much like the multiplayer version, the game simply dumps you out into a world and lets you try to figure out how to survive without explaining anything. The world is fairly unique and interesting, but like the multiplayer version, this game also has permadeath, and unlike the multiplayer version, there's no settings to make this easier, so the game basically expects you to repeatedly die to things you had no way to see coming to slowly learn over time. This may be a fun gameplay loop for some, but I unfortunately just found this tedious and frustrating. It's even more frustrating when things you've learned in the multiplayer version don't apply quite the same, as you're never quite sure if the things you've learned in one game will apply in the other, and this game is also missing some quality of life features that have made the multiplayer version more approachable as well (such as the compendium). This game also doesn't really seem to be getting updated anymore either, while the multiplayer version is still getting frequent updates.

The only thing this game seems to have over the multiplayer version is the existence of story content, which is pretty cool, as I've always missed this when playing the multiplayer version. Unfortunately, the story content in this game still seems pretty sparse, and it appears to primarily found in something called Adventure Mode, where you're tasked with entering five separate brand new worlds that are modified to be even more challenging. This was pretty disappointing for me, as I was looking forwards to getting lore which was missing from the multiplayer version, but starting over in a brand new (and harder) world five times in a row without dying once was just too much to ask when I was already having a hard time justifying spending time in this game when the multiplayer version exists.

The game does still have the extremely good, iconic art style that the series is known for, and I didn't encounter any bugs while playing this game.

[b]TL;DR[/b] This survival game has a great art style, runs well, and has a unique world to explore. However, the multiplayer version of this game Don't Starve Together is simply better, as it allows you to play with friends, has quality of life features that are missing from this game, and is still getting updates, which doesn't appear to be the case for this game. The story content is the only thing this game has that the multiplayer version doesn't, but it's far too sparse and the game requires a lot of work to reach it, so if you're really interested in this game, I'd highly recommend looking at [url=store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/]Don't Starve Together[/url] instead.",False,3,0,1747277759,N/A,Steam

Unfortunately, I didn't.

Don't Starve is a survival crafter with no tutorial and no explanation. This fits the other-world horror theme of how you suddenly found yourself in this strange and confusing universe. I can appreciate the lack of handholding. Is that red or green mushroom going to heal you or hurt you? One way to find out!

When I say no explanation, I mean [b]no explanation[/b]. You do not see how much damage your axe does, or how effective your armor is. I found multiple headgears. What do they do? Who knows! Just pay attention and maybe you'll find out!

When you die, you start over completely. The only progress you make is the knowledge you take with you.
(Hopefully that mushroom didn't finish you off!)

While it's a rare take on crafter games to be so unforgiving, I can get behind it. I enjoy a good challenge and mystery.

Except... man, oh man, is it going to feel repetitive going through your lessons.

The humanoid pigs in the game are neutral and can speak. There's really not justification to kill them, but many crafting recipes require items obtained by killing the pig people or destroying their houses.

My other complaint about the game is that it is extremely unforgiving when learning. I feel like several of my deaths were just because it was the first time I encountered a new monster, event, food, etc. I know I could brute force my way through by playing and dying lots of times, but I would have to invest far too much time learning that way. One way to address this issue at least with foods would be to clearly explain whether or not a food is going to hurt the character (e.g., +10 hunger, -10 health).

My third issue is that it's not clear how much damage weapons are doing. It's hard to tell if one item is better or worse than another.

I've won National Championships in the old EA NCAA games, started a expansion team in 2K, and even had CM Punk retire due to a drug addiction in one of my many fake wrestling promotions. But nothing compares to the stories that have come from the various iterations of Football Manager. 

Part of it is simply how complex soccer is. There are hundreds of leagues and thousands of players. And the game itself can be very complicated. A player who is amazing in one scheme can be dogshit in another. Even egos and personality types come into play -- I distinctly remember one Liverpool save where I bought Harry Kane and it caused my whole team to mutiny. 

Sports games all come with management modes now, but compared to the depth of Football Manager it's like the difference between swimming in the deep end and wading in a kiddie pool. It's not for everyone but if this is your type of game it doesn't get better than this.

Dusk,1100600,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Sports",76561198052941992,"Football Manager (FM) isn't just about numbers and text to those who understand its magic. It's a realm where dreams take shape, where the fervor for football finds its digital haven.

Within this simulated universe, every notion and hope a fan harbors for their beloved club can materialize. Whether orchestrating the rise of a prestigious club to triple-crown glory or navigating the challenges of a lower-tier team, each stride forward is a personal conquest. You might assume the guise of a savvy dealmaker, wheeling and dealing for profit, or opt for unorthodox methods, nurturing a squad of homegrown talent like your own progeny. The game allows for hands-on involvement in every facet or the luxury of delegating tasks, assuming the role of a contented overseer.

My journey with FM spans numerous years—just me, my trusty computer, a flask of coffee, and a journal. No breaks, no shortcuts. Ahead of every match, I meticulously analyze opponents, fine-tune tactics, and maintain an extensive library of football literature for insights. The highs of nail-biting victories and the lows of gut-wrenching defeats are etched in my memory. I can still vividly recall the heartbreak of losing a Champions League final on penalties to Atletico Madrid, feeling the weight of defeat akin to Mourinho himself. Yet, there are those indelible moments, like Ruben Neves' last-minute heroics against Liverpool, clinching the Premier League title for my team. At the final whistle, I pumped my fist in triumph, wanting to shout from the rooftops, ""I reign supreme!""

Years of leadership have witnessed resignation in the face of board disagreements, accompanied by the poignant departure of loyal staff. Witnessing homegrown talents blossom fills me with paternal pride, while lackluster performances stir frustration, sometimes prompting me to pound the table, yearning for halftime substitutions. These genuine emotions of elation, fury, anguish, and mirth distinguish FM—it's not just a game; it's a slice of life.

This iteration of FM stands as a testament to its predecessors, boasting refinement and depth. Despite its flaws—the missed opportunities, the erratic crossing of wingers—its allure remains irresistible. Launching Football Manager, you can envision yourself on the pitch, amid the scent of freshly mown grass, with players by your side. As you bask in the adulation of fans, their chants echoing, their anthems composed for you, there's nothing quite like it.

For those uninitiated into this fantastical realm, ensure you have your player face packs, team logos, 2D and 3D kit packs, and authentic trophy images at the ready. And for aspiring coaches seeking these enhancements, don't hesitate to reach out.",True,0,0,1706518408,N/A,Steam

The 3D match engine brings your tactical choices to life, adding a visually engaging layer to your strategies. The learning curve is steep, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly rewarding.

Dusk,1100600,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Sports",76561198103953421,"FM20 is the first FM game I really sank my teeth into after becoming legitimately interested in the sport, albeit I didn't start playing it in earnest until 2022. The series as a whole is a monumental achievement in simulation, even with its flaws, and there are many. If you're playing FM, you're not playing it for great graphics or sound, or even necessarily amazing gameplay, but for the sheer depth and detail of the simulated world, with thousands upon thousands of real players and teams meticulously coded in in a way that FIFA could only dream of.

FM is also amazing at giving you moments of pure emotion as you watch a game unfold. It really does feel like a mixture of actually having the game be in your hands, while still watching it as a spectator or fan. One of the most memorable FM20 moments for me was when my Arsenal side came back from 4-0 down to Manchester City at halftime to draw 4-4 with the last action of the game in an absolute masterclass of a second half. The sheer joy when Bastoni scored that header was one of the highest highs I've ever had from a video game, and that includes much bigger achievements in that same save. That was the moment that launched the most successful Premier League season that Arsenal have ever had. But not just joy, but sadness, and anger also. A football season is long and arduous and you will always have failures, and they hurt. But FM is great for all of those moments; it feels like you're really going through a season, with all the highs and lows, and that's what FM is best for.

What I like about this game, over FM 22 and 23, which I've also played, is the interaction interface. In more recent games they've made this terrible change where most of the screen is empty except for a single dialogue bit from your player, and then all of your options crammed at the bottom of the screen. This is awful for my poor eyesight. In this game things are more centered and obvious. Also, the change they made in later games to hide the energy level numbers in favor of hearts? Also not a fan, both because I'd prefer things to be less obtuse, even if it's less realistic, and again for vision purposes.

Of course this version missing things I've grown to quite like, like the date hub and more agent interactions, and players deteriorate in quality too quickly in this game, while in later entries they age a bit more gracefully, which is more realistic. FM23 also has the UEFA licenses, which is nice, though I suspect pretty much anyone who plays this mods in such things anyway.

Overall FM20 is still worth revisiting if you have it, to play out certain kinds of games, even if you have later entries.

However I feel there is a lot of room for improvement,  especially with regen ethnicites, for example there are no asian ethnicity in the game, and not enough kits and other licensing. to make it more realistic.

this results to gamers getting 3rd party mods which also have potential to bug the whole game. It would be nice if the developers concentrated on this part for improvements and the regens looks, and personality such as a manager the player can't work with or team mate or club he dislikes.  As there isn't enough of what a player dislikes.

The tactics of the game is awful. Managers do not need to change their tactics and tweak every 10 or so games because the opposition figure them out. The best managers in the world have used the same tactics for a decade. Altering it to change the flow now and again. They let the opposition worry about them and not changing a tactic because they might get beat. They change the system within the game. FM20 is the worst ever for this. Just when you get a decent tactic you have to start all over again. This is just not realistic. Because of this FM20 will be my last addition. The game is now dead. I think eventually everyone will get sick of having to create a new tactic 3 times a season. Its just isn't a Football sim anymore where you pit your strategy against other managers, even if they are AI they should all still have their own character and styles.

- It seems som of the underlying algorithms have changed. It is much harder to scores goals to the point that you need 10 chances on target pr goal.  There are matches that have generated 2 clear cut chances and up to 20 shots on target that have ended 0-0.  The fun factor and gravitational pull for me has definately been removed because goals are now at a premium.
- The game crashes - I have never experienced FM crashes in any of the  previous versions. Yet on this version 2020 and playing on a laptop with a core I7 processor - I encounter occasional ""freezes"" in particular after having been awarded a penalty meaning you have to shut down and start afresh.  Despite following the youtube guides on how to resolve this issues - the crashes still happen from time to time.
- The beauty of the FM series was that over time you sensed that your imprint on the team would be more  and more discernable - your style of pay and so on. The interaction between you as a player and your team was what provided the incredible gravitational pull to this game. I don't feel that in this version.

I loved the concept of being able to Manage football teams and bring them up through the leagues and win trophy's etc. but you can only enjoy this game if you skip over the live matches which unfortunately (for the logic of the game itself) is what makes real Football exciting. Why skip the matches?  Because the AI has a script that influences the outcome of games.  For example, you have Defensive players that hoof the ball forward for no reason, while under no pressure.  Guess what happens most times?  The other team gathers the ball, counterattacks and scores and this happens despite the fact that players traits or tactics were changed to avoid long kicks forward.  You have players directed to mark opponents closely under a defensive tactic and you end up with opponent players unmarked for 20-30 meters.  Guess how that ends up? Defenders under no pressure heading back balls to opponents distanced 10-20 meters away.  Players getting outrun or outpaced by opponents with lower Attribute abilities.  I could list dozen and dozen more little 'tricks' that the AI uses to decide the outcome of games.  All of which takes away from the purpose of the game which is your ability to Manage a Football team.  Penalties, send offs are all heavily unbalanced against your team.  The game also lacks comeback scores (unless it's the AI's team).  If you go down 2-0, forget about trying to draw or even worse, to win.

If you're a fan of management / simulation games, looking for something to get stuck into, but don't live, eat, and breathe football then stay [i]well[/i] clear of Football Manager 2020.[/b]

So, this probably goes without saying, but don't pick up this game unless you're already, like, [i]really[/i] into football; I received a key as part of a humble bundle, so figured I would give it a go and...yeah, nah.

The game makes a lot of assumptions before you begin:

[list]
[*] You already know a lot of technical information about football
[*] You already know what you want to do in the game before you play
[*] You already know how you would go about achieving those goals IRL
[/list]

The process of starting the game for the first time is absurdly long; I assumed I was still in an installer for a long time before I realised that all of the setup I'd been doing was actually just part of the game.

The weirdest part of it all as well, is that it does all of this [b]in absolute silence[/b] - there is no music at all, and the UI is completely silent; no clicks on buttons, no confirmations, no hover sounds. I spoke with my flatmate and apparently this isn't a bug, it's just how the game works.  The effect is eerie as heck.

In terms of onboarding - nope. Afraid not. There's no gradual introduction of variables and features to ease you into the game, it just throws everything at you at once! The tutorial consists of, I kid you not, an inescapable sequence of tooltips that explains how to use the UI without explaining what any of the player stats do, or explaining what you should do.

+ has original names sometimes
+ managing aspect of the game works out
+ looks fun
+ its deep

- ""football"" simulation itself is one the worst of its kind
- game gives useless advices
- ingame turorials are minor and not very helpfull
- way too much repetitive clicking
- no difficulty change
- not possible to score a goal if your tactic settings wont pass the in game goal calculation
- hardcoded scoring possibilities
- low tier managing stuff can't be automated

300+ hours in, still feel very uncomfortable watching this game simulation and my strikers missing 95% of chances while although playing like messi in the passing departement.
Game itself gives useless advices on how i should start my games, which are most of the time tactics i never trained before and therefore will loose me games.

Although i have a strong feeling that goals are only calculated by current values like player abilities + tactic setting and not the game evolution itself. That is why you will see 60-1 chances and 80% possession for your team on a regular basis but only 0-0 these games.

Changing the tactic in game is although not thought through. Lots of clicking and annoying window switching will happen too you.

The managing aspect of the game can be fun if you are kind enough to overlook the heavy repetive clicking which makes this game a clicker in some way.
The heart of the game, the engine is the worst. It ruins most of the fun of this game. How its programmed and how its presents football is like the beginning of football coming to pc in the 90's.

Recommended? 👍 Yes

After 21.4 hours, I can confidently say Elden Ring is one of the most immersive experiences I’ve had in gaming. The world feels alive — every corner hides something worth discovering, whether it’s a new boss, a hidden dungeon, or just breathtaking scenery. The combat is punishing but fair, and every victory feels earned.
What really stands out is the freedom: you’re never forced down a single path. I’ve spent hours just exploring, finding my own way, and still feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. The sense of scale and mystery keeps me hooked, and I’m loving every moment.
If you enjoy challenging combat, deep lore, and a world that rewards curiosity, Elden Ring is absolutely worth it.",True,0,0,1764151731,N/A,Steam
Elden Ring,1245620,59.99,16,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, RPG",76561198018778064,"[h1] Elden Ring: The Triumph and Agony of an Open World in the Spirit of FromSoftware [/h1] 

Elden Ring is not just another RPG from the creators of Dark Souls, but a bold experiment at the intersection of genres. The game combines hardcore «souls‑like» action, a vast open world, and a deep character customization system. For fans of the series, it is both a long‑awaited evolution of ideas and a challenge: there are no easy breaks here, but there is plenty of room for creativity. Immersion into the world of the Lands Between turns into a marathon where every victory is a small personal revolution.

[h2] Strengths: Why the Game Became a Cult Classic [/h2]
First and foremost, [i] Elden Ring [/i] is three games in one: a classic «souls» title with punishing bosses, a sandbox with boundless exploration opportunities, and an RPG with near‑infinite character customization. The meticulously crafted gameplay keeps players on edge — every battle demands full concentration, and death serves as a lesson rather than a failure. A wide array of combat mechanics (melee combat, magic, ranged attacks, spirit summoning) encourages tactical experimentation.
The character progression variety is truly impressive: the attribute system ([i] Vigor, Mind, Endurance, etc. [/i]) and the [i] Ashes of War [/i] mechanic grant players the freedom to create unique builds — from a stealthy sorcerer to a mighty greathammer warrior. The diverse roster of bosses (from colossal dragons to nimble assassins) ensures constant engagement, with their distinct attack patterns demanding careful study of every move.
The authentic dark fantasy aesthetic crafts an atmosphere of both despair and grandeur: crumbling castles, eerie forests, and desolate plains resemble sets for an epic tragedy. The deliberate, hint‑based storytelling rewards exploration — every nook and cranny might conceal a treasure. The locations are distinct from one another: from snow‑capped peaks to poisonous swamps, each zone boasts its own visual style and gameplay mechanics.

[h2] Weaknesses: Where the Game Falls Short [/h2]
The main drawback is the vast open world, which sometimes feels empty. Long journeys between key points can become tedious, and certain areas fail to meet players’ expectations. The initial story zones are not sufficiently engaging: the early bosses and locations don’t deliver the adrenaline rush that series fans are accustomed to.
An overabundance of quests creates chaos: many side missions are disconnected from one another, and their objectives often contradict each other. The plot remains obscure even after many hours of play — it’s nearly impossible to grasp without diving deep into the lore. The world is extremely uninformative: there are no hints, marked maps, or NPC guides, which might discourage new players.
The repetitive patterns of some bosses are a trade‑off for the game’s scale: giant creatures often boil down to “dodge sweeping attacks”, while mages usually follow the “wait out the cast” pattern. This diminishes the sense of uniqueness, especially in the later stages of the game.

[h2] Conclusion: A Masterpiece with Rough Edges [/h2]
[i] Elden Ring [/i] is an ambitious project that redefines the genre. Its strengths — versatility, atmosphere, and combat system — outweigh its flaws, though the latter are certainly noticeable. The game demands time, patience, and a love for exploration; for those willing to immerse themselves in its world, it offers unforgettable experiences.
This is not just «another souls game» — it’s a statement: an open world can be challenging, beautiful, and endlessly engaging. If you’re ready for the challenges and crave the freedom of choice, the Lands Between await.

[h3] [i] Score: 9/10 [/i] [/h3]

The open world itself is forgettable since it poses zero challenge to the player.  You can just turn your brain off and run past every enemy with zero punishment. People still reminisce about their first time in Blight Town or facing those two guys down the well in Bloodborne. There is literally nothing of sort in Elden Ring.

The small dungeons spread out in the open world sometimes have interesting gimmicks but usually end with you killing a reused boss and being rewarded something you'll never end up using. Bloodborne chalices had random layouts, a decent amount of  enemies/bosses not in the regular game and gave you a reason to do them in Blood gems. All that and most people still skipped them. Ubisoft level bloat for people who don't realize more playtime doesn't make a game better. 

Legacy dungeons, you don't even want to explore because after doing a few you realize the only decent content the game has are the bosses. DS1 was praised for the inteconnected world, DS2 and 3 still had shortcuts you could discover by exploring.  The level design once again devolved with ER, with a grace around every corner the shortcuts and the relief from finally finding one are mostly gone. 

Bosses, I've died to Malenia, Messmer and Radahn dozens of times yet none of them gave me the same dopamine hit from killing Gael or Orphan in maybe one fifth of the tries. It feels like 90% of the challenge with all these big bad bosses are their one or two crazy moves. You'll die over and over to Waterfowl or the big snake combo Messmer has until you figure out when and which way to roll or run. You'll never get that adrenaline rush from getting a boss to 5-10% your first try because these moves solely exist to make older players not whine about everything else by giving the illusion of difficulty while still letting the new ""broader audience"" tank half the combos with their summon. This contrast in difficulty between the world and the bosses also makes the game feel like a boss rush rather than an adventure like the older games.

Narrative, they don't leave things to imagination much compared to the older games. Ranni probably blogs more about the story than the entirety of DS1 dialogue. Around the same amount of NPC questlines in a much bigger world makes the world feel even more barren. Through 3 playthroughs I haven't noticed a Solaire, Lucatiel or Anri. Someone on a similar journey, living their own life you come across multiple times. Maybe they exist but the world isn't interesting enough for me to go find them.

Multiplayer, covenants are gone, invasions are opt-in. All the fun sucked out of it because god forbid the people who already look up everything online would have to look up how to turn invasions off too.

It's still an okay game but I'm worried where FromSoft is heading. I don't care if some guy who didn't have the dedication to beat the older games now gets to have fun beating bosses with spells/summons/weapon arts as long as it doesn't end up making the game a worse experience but the multiple steps backwards taken in level/world design, narrative, multiplayer are clearly an attempt to make the game more appealing to them, and it affects everyone.

From the moment you pick it up, it’s clear that this is a game crafted with a profound love for its genre and a meticulous attention to detail.

The core gameplay loop is incredibly addictive. It's a top-down, bullet-hell rogue-lite that perfectly blends precise shooting mechanics with the thrill of randomized dungeon crawling. Each run feels fresh and exciting, thanks to the vast array of weapons and items you can discover. And ""vast"" is an understatement—the sheer creativity on display is staggering. You’ll find everything from a gun that shoots bees to one that fires t-shirts, all contributing to a uniquely chaotic and charming experience.

Dodge Roll, the developers, have infused the game with a personality that shines through every pixelated corner. The art style is gorgeous, the humor is spot-on (the ""Gundead"" enemies are a particular highlight), and the subtle references hidden throughout the Gungeon are a joy to uncover.

Yes, the game is difficult. It’s a bullet-hell, after all. You will die. A lot. But the beauty of Enter the Gungeon lies in its progression system. You constantly unlock new weapons, items, and characters, ensuring that every failure feels like a step toward a deeper understanding of the game’s mechanics. The learning curve is steep but incredibly satisfying to master. Executing a perfect dodge roll through a storm of bullets and clearing a room of enemies feels incredibly rewarding.

Ultimately, Enter the Gungeon is a masterclass in game design. It's challenging, charming, replayable, and a genuinely joyous experience. It's a game that respects your time and rewards your skill, making it an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a new obsession. Lock and load; you won't regret entering this Gungeon!

That said ... I hate this game, lmao.  The RNG was unbelievably obnoxious.  I can appreciate a difficult game, but when your success relies on a certain amount of RNG in order to reliably handle the more difficult content yet the RNG is absolutely horrendous and the item pool isn't all that great ... well, let's just say my experiences overall sucked pretty hard thanks to that.

I managed to beat the game a few times which for sure was great the first time I managed to do it ... but the time it took between runs in order to actually have a powerful enough setup to reliably complete the game completely killed all of my motivation and drive to keep playing this game for years to come.

I don't know how it is now.  I never gave the updates a chance because my experiences were such a pain in the ass, even when people told me ""Oh it's so much better now, they did x y z"" too little too late, man, I was already sick of this game.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,9.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198038349175,"Before I start an important disclaimer:

If you are prone to epileptic seizures or in any way sensitive to strobe lights, DO NOT ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game spams strobe lights like it's Christmas, from beginning of the game to finish. If you play this game and you're an epileptic, you will be as dead as this game's protagonist, before even the intro ends.

But yeah, this game. It's pretty flawed.

As I said before, this game spams strobe lights. It also has it's hard to pronounce name, as well as this 3d pixel style that to be perfectly honest, looks kinda ugly. 

The gameplay is the weakest part of Continue, because you are so reliant on rng to not screw you over it's ridiculous. See, in each stage, with gc stages being the only exceptions, your goal is to escape the stage with lightning, while building shelters for gc stages with your prayers. However, lightning strikes at random, so it's entirely possible to have your run ruined all because lightning struck the same already cleared location three times. This is tolerable on large in length levels, but if you get bad lightning strikes on somewhere like the Riverbanks, your run is pretty much over, because you cannot escape in time.

The plot? This game does seem to have a story, but it's a jumbled unconnected mess. Each stage has its own story, its own history, but its all disconnected from the protagonist, which are shuffled everytime you restart the game anyway. The only thing we know for sure is what's on the cover.

And yet, despite all that, despite all these problems, I still love this game. A lot.

The music and the atmosphere are some of the places where this game shines. I don't remember the last time I felt so peaceful when playing a video game. I would download the whole OST if I could. The filters and the sound effects, give the game a weird broken console dream simulator quality that I can't really explain. That, combined with some really touching scenes and you have yourself a game that made me cry at several times.

There's also the message itself. As someone who had troubles accepting the idea of dying herself, I was completely repelled by this game when I first saw it. It seemed to me like just as a game so dark and so obsessed with its own darkness, that it would be completely unenjoyable. It wasn't. It was a journey, complete with thoughts and feelings people may have when they confront their own mortality. And it ended up being one of the most serene games I have ever played in my entire life. I haven't expected to be so pleasantly surprised at all.

So final verdict? I dunno. I can see why people can be turned off by the message and the gameplay and other things. The dev himself said that he made this game this way SPECIFICALLY to repel CoD brogamer dudes. From the name itself, to pretty generic gameplay, I get it. Still, I'd say give it a chance.

If you love these cerebral, borderline-walking simulator type games that are very emotional and sad, maybe this game will give you something. If you are like me and are struggling with accepting your own demise, maybe this game will help you not worry about your own mortality as much and even accept it like it did for me. If you are looking for some neat gameplay or a story heavy game, pass. This game will not satisfy you. And if you're prone to epileptic seizures, dear god stay away.",True,6,0,1468680251,N/A,Steam

It's somewhat mysterious and pretty good at creating tension while aiming to bring about its philosophical conclusion. We see deliberately low-poly 3D graphics which nevertheless are easily translated into ""the world"".
The game expects the player to go for several, slightly changing run-throughs, not all of which let the player get to the end. The player is mostly playing on limited time but can sort of recover in mostly unskippable cut-scenes. Will you find the strength to go on or will you find the strength to rest?

+ Nice low-poly design
+ Good music and good atmosphere
+ Special exits
+ Live stories
+ Restarting areas
0 ""On the clock""
0 A tad short
- Bad restart method - ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""
- Camera is sort far-sighted
- Fade-ins waste time and make it harder to react
- Controls somewhat lacking
- Incomplete menu with and ambiguous option

The game features a number of modes. There is investigation mode where you run around an area or level, talk to people and gather knowledge which is needed to find an exit from the area and build up shelters, all within a time limit (except for the first level which has slightly different rules). That mode already shows how the camera is sort of far-sighted when giving a perspective view. Enemies will randomly and with increasing ferocity and frequency spawn around you. While the perspective view shows enemies or people in the background pretty well, it's hard to see things in the foreground. This is coupled with the foreground also often going down. So it is possible that you run the avatar towards the foreground/player, run over an edge, be in the air and without control over the avatar while unknowingly steering into an enemy. You have a sword to fight of enemies but to use it effectively you still need to know where enemies are.

Running into an enemy brings you into an action mode of always the same type where you have to fight of a number of enemies approaching you from the air while you play in a 2D brawler fashion, think minimalistic smash brothers. Those fights are easy but time-consuming at first but grow challenging and fast over the levels/investigation areas.
Hint: When jumping and attacking in the air go into the direction the avatar is not looking to make an overhead swing.

Each investigation areas also features up to three other action modes where you are thrown in one of a number of, let's say, mini-games. There are some where you have to find an exit, there are some where you have kill objectives and there is even one where you simply go right.
Action modes mostly offer treasure and performance-based rewards, but failing them results in harsh consequences.

The third mode is a shelter mode where you need to hide from impending doom. It's paramount to have gathered enough shelters or this is where the avatar gets GC'ed.

While cut-scenes offer time for recovery and breaks - they prompt the player before continuing - they are mostly unskippable and it may take you upwards from 30 seconds to get into an investigative area. This is unnerving in connection with the restart feature. You can restart the current investigative area if you feel like you didn't get enough out of it - the game autosaves at the beginning of an investigative area. While the game tells you restarting is an option it doesn't tell you how to realise that option. Instead of clicking the button ""Start Over"" in the menu and confirming the reset you have to kill the application and restart it, then you are loaded back into the area.
The reset instead means starting the whole run over and losing all progress, not just that of the last area. Imagine my happiness when I found out.

Apart from the ""far-sighted camera"" problem there is another one with visuals. While investigating you are required to enter houses. When you subsequently leave them the main area fades in, i.e. the world is turned back on before you can see clearly. While you can remember positions of enemies or people and interact with them blindly you are more likely to run into a problematic situation all while running out of time.

Action modes have a number of control problems. First off, navigation is sometimes hard because you don't always know which things you can pass over and which things present an obstacle.
Then, I often felt like I couldn't turn fast enough with incoming enemies. When trying to stab enemies you sometimes only hit when your sword is at or near full extension. So despite facing the enemy and presenting good points they will hit you anyway, reduce your performance and hinder progress in the meta-game.
Specifically the last and fix action mode where you need to turn and jump had me failing jumps multiple times because ""up"" is somehow not available  when being pressed while changing directions. And yes, I specifically bought a keyboard where ghosting doesn't happen when only two keys are pressed.

I found the gathering of knowledge surprisingly fun, the random life stories are effective towards the game's philosophical goal and I enjoyed the special exits you can find. Even though I played through the game with ""full points"" I have yet to see some parts of the game.
If you're not immediately put off by its graphical style, I'd say give this a go. With all the little short-comings listed above, I, maybe not highly but securely, recommend Continue?9876543210. Even with its relative shortness of six captivating hours its price tag compares well against the average movie.

""Oh little town
shelter me""",True,1,0,1440018332,N/A,Steam
FTL Faster Than Light,263340,9.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561197989203587,"I don't know why people haven't tagged it this way, but its obvious that this game is a roguelite behind the messages and themes that it contains. Jason Oda covers the whole story aspect pretty well in the about section of the store page, so I will focus my review on the game beneath the facade.

The game mentions that you take on 6 out of 11 levels each playthrough, but these 11 levels appear to be split into two different types where there arent any major differences other than the graphics/map layout for levels of the same type.  The first type being a tag/hide and seek with npcs and the second, more frequent kind, is an open town where you talk with the npcs and try to gather keys,resources, and information. This repetition would be boring if it wasn't for the short minigames in between.

There are at least 5 different types of minigames ranging from platforming to Galaga to zelda dungeons and these different types can come in varying difficulties. If you succeed at the minigames, there is much to gain, especially if you play them perfectly, but they can also be rather dangerous

First off of the roguelite checklist, randomness. Random characters, random levels, random npcs, random minigames, randumb... The first two don't really make a difference, but the random npcs are what make the game. You'll have to get clues and keys from these npcs, but not all are to be trusted.  The npcs never seem to lie about information, so aside from getting some nonsense one liner that wastes your time talking to the npc, the worst they will do is sell you a trapped room. However, since you can get free, safe rooms from the rounds, the npcs really are the least of your problems. The information from the npcs will make otherwise random choices definite, but if you are really desperate for time or resources you can guess questions, although you don't really need to do that to beat the game.

The worst of all randomness is the lightning. The first kind of lightning is used to pave the way to an exit, but there are several exits and its possible that your lightning will hit an empty space, so it is easy for the lighting to be spread out and still not have an exit. These rolls will make or break your runs, they are the difference between having to focus all of your resources just to make it to the next level and being able to safely farm resources with impunity. Then there is the matter of having to find shelter in the storms. The randomness here has the potential to be more punishing when you have few buildings. Some buildings can take 1 or 2 lightning bolts and still stand for the next storm, but too few buildings and these tankier buildings are likelier to be destroyed. Despite all of the possible ways you can get fucked by the dice, you do have a decent bit of leeway to messup. Even if you get a few bad dice rolls, you should be able to make those up with resources from playing the minigames well.

Then there is the matter of death. You can use your various resources to get second chances once you 'die', but when you run out of those, you must start from the beginning.  Additionally, the penalty when using buildings to revive gets increasingly severe, while using money to revive, while a static cost, will prevent you from getting more buildings/lightning.

What do you get for replaying this game? Mostly you just get to see different specs of story/dialogue; however, actually seeking out the in game diaries will be detrimental to progressing to the end, but I suppose that's just part of the message with this kind of game. You'll see the different level art styles and see some different minigames, but thats about it. Some roguelites require you to play the game over and over to get direct benefits or crucial knowledge, but any useful knowledge is rerolled with each new game aside from knowing how to play a specific minigame.

In the end, its not close to being the hardest game of the genre since you dont need a truly perfect run to beat the game, but it isn't too simple either. Players have the option of playing the way the developer would, but you could also speedrun it too if you wanted to. I recommend both playing to win and playing to explore in order to get the most out of this game.

These two games share a lot in their way of telling the narrative - or not telling. It is much to the player to figure out things yourself.  Just fine with that - there are not that many games on Steam that are 'artsy' like this and are yet able to provide a experience without becoming some kind of weird ego trip for the dev.  

Unfortunately Continue?9876543210 goes for a more action oriented road despite having a somewhat more undrestandable universe where events take place (inside a computer).  This is this game downfall since after the early interest goes away all that is left is a frantic action game where you try to mass enough shelters to survive data purge and enough lighting strikes to open a exit path. You also better learn the ropes with the action scenes quick since you cannot survive long if you need to start paying foo (money) or car parts (continues) to go on. 

I found the lore interesting. No gods to pray to, just fading memories and void in the computer ram when the purge comes to eliminate the survivors. Too bad this marvelous setting gets lost under the frantic action. 

This game has got all the components for a cult classic. unfortunately it will not be so. Designed differently 'my lightning, my prayer' could be almost as well known saying as 'the cake is a lie'.

How many Marios have I plunged down bottomless pits?  How many chosen nobodies of Tamriel have I gotten run through?  Alas, the video game lives that have served me, I have not served well in return.  Sometimes in the throes of drink or the in darkness of despair I wonder what has become of those unfortunate sprites, those amalgamated polygons with their illusions of agency.

Continue?987654321 tells the story of one such departed and the game begins with her dying moments.  The machinations of digital afterlife play out before us as we witness the software of souls.  Shortly thereafter, we're given control of our fallen warrior in a run-down corner of the afterlife.  ""Where are we,"" our spirit character asks another. ""Well..."" he replies tilting his rectantangle head up to ours, ""I suppose on a line of code, on a sliver of light, floating aimlessly through the random access memory.""  Unwilling to fade peacefully into the digital night, our heroine strikes out to escape the inescapable.

The game unfolds as we move from town to town, one step ahead of oblivion.  Each vignette is a small area to explore and escape.  The player has several minutes of game time in blocky planescapes to find the folks that can grant them lighting or prayers.  Some are vendors, some are quest givers and some are simple well wishers.  There are few ne'er do wells in this well of souls;  everyone is facing the same dissolution.  Their bestowed lightning can destroy barriers to level exits, their prayers raise buildings in the one place where our heroine can shelter against the wrath of the Garbage Collector. 

At set intervals the player is thrown into minigames.  Some involve zelda-like dungeons, some are hacks and slashes and some involve a bit of platforming.  All in all, they're quick diversions enabling the player to get more precious foo and ram.  Foo buys you lightning, prayers, extra time and second chances.  Ram is your resistance to the Garbage Collector's pursuing minions.  Run out of ram too soon or fail to escape a level and watch your shelters blasted into smithereens and know that next time you run for shelter, there may be none left.

If the game seems disjointed, it is.  But it works mostly because the minigames are challenging, diverse and fun. And through each disjoint, the unifying metaphor is ever present.  Death is not something that many of us choose to think about.  Perhaps it is a Western mindset, or perhaps it is even gamings' own emphasis on not dying that encourages the avoidance of the inevitable.  Continue?987654321 takes a more Eastern approach.  

It is zen-like and Buddha-ful experience, though a bit heavy handed at times. In the squalor of the /apps/Ghangees level, we encounter a npc and her dead grandmother whose foot has been stolen by a stray dog.  But while often grim, it is touching at times and refreshingly self aware:  during a dream the player may approach and ask questions of the great Garbage Collector like 'What is the metaphor?' For which it has no answer.  Between one level and another we're asked to do a short meditation remembering our dearest departed pet.

When games go all philosophy they usually go all pretentious too.  Not so with Continue.  Many of the levels are ponderous locales, but in their pixel precise portrayal of squalor and the evocative conversation of their denizens, there is a comfort in despair. Perhaps the comfort is in acceptance, but either way at the end of the game, based on how long she lasted, the player is told how their avatar met her inevitable death.  Did she escape long enough to come to grips with its mortality?  Or was she ripped from digitalia with wailing and gnashing of teeth?

Continue brings to mind a book I'm fond of named ""The Beginning Place"" by Ursula LeGuin.  At its most basic level, it is the story of two people who run from their lives and find each other in a broken fantasy world.  When read at that level, the story is a bit uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying.  But when read as the allegory it is intended to be, it's a journey that offers the reader new insight every time through.  Continue?987654321 is not unlike that novel.  If one sits at their keyboard expecting metroid or its latest manifestation, one might walk away slightly underwhelmed.  But when experienced as the metaphor it is meant to be, Continue is far greater than the sum of its mini games, its foo and its ram.  It is a sober reminder of the priceless now, a virtual wise man on the mountain offering wisdom where so many other games merely offer escape, a life lesson to be learned over and over.

Go and wander to lovely, awesome and mysterious places.

I really, really, really wanted to like this game. Continue? is a beautiful idea, and has very strange but wonderful writing. I love this style of graphics, so that's another tally in the ""Pro"" column. The music is nice, and some of the stage designs were really wonderful. A special shout-out goes to the Pink Castle level, where a number of princesses wander about. One of them tells you a story about being kidnapped and taken to a castle, where she awaited rescue. And when no one came, she took up a sword and beheaded anyone who got in her way, forging a new path for herself to carve out a life where she could have peace. It was a beautifully written story that I wish I had screen shots of, but unfortunately the levels randomly generate and I can't quite work up the motivation to play again until I get to that level. Which brings me to my next point…

There are some flaws. Big ones. The idea of semi-random encounter battles that drop you into a sort of mini-game based on some other style of game, mostly arcade-style games from what I saw, is a really great concept that fits the theme of this game and it's story. The downside is that the encounters are frustratingly difficult, to the point of nearly gamebreaking, and ultimately I gave up on this title. It has some other flaws, some in the mechanics (I hit some glitches that required me to start the game over--which is ironic as hell, considering the plot of a game character battling through random access memory trying to buy time to avoid being deleted) and some with the repetitive nature of the conversations and cut scenes that can't be avoided or skipped. I will, hopefully, pick this up again one day. I recommend Continue? because it's an interesting idea with some cool graphics and great music. But take the recommendation with a grain of salt, because in a lot of ways it's very difficult to play through and not the rewarding experience I had hoped for.

It begins with a beautifully drawn-out introduction on the death of a videogame character. Yet, he doesn't want to die. He escapes deletion for a while, and it's your job to keep him alive. While that sounds like an interesting premise for a game, Continue? doesn't stop there. Oh no. You quickly realise that the developer is trying to tell you something, and it soon turns into a reflection on life, on death, on childhood, love, freedom, knowledge and the inevitable. Each scenario that you play through is meant to be a prayer, not necessarily in an overtly religious sense (in fact, the game never comes across as preachy) but more in a sense of inner prayer, inner discovery for who you are, and what the important things in life are. It's not surprising that the developer made this game following a near-death experience. It does make you wonder whether there are better things to be doing with your life than playing a game, but that's beside the point!

Yes, there is a game here, but it's a long, drawn-out game full of interludes and reflection. Let me warn you, if you're not the kind of person who can sit through 5 minute long dreamy interludes, this game is probably not for you. Even the introduction, beautiful though it is, is completely unskippable each and every time you begin a new ""life"". When you eventually reach the gameplay, you're in a for a shock: it's hectic! You need to dash around looking for characters to speak to. Each will give you a clue, or a cryptic message, or open a door to a building. Getting information and opening doors is essential, because it's here that you can choose to either destroy sections of barriers that impede your exit from the level, or construct more buildings in your sanctuary town (more on that shortly). There's a strict time limit here, and you're also being chased around by chompers (servants of the garbage collector trying to delete you) that will drag you away to mini games if they touch you. Mini games happen every 45 to 60 seconds, and are either 2d riffs on simple arcade games, or 3d exploration / combat games. None last long, yet if you fail you will suffer the consequences! Each failure usually leads to the destruction of buildings in your sanctuary, and this is fatal if you aren't careful. Every two levels you will be taken to your sanctuary to survive a garbage collection ""storm"". Several buildings will be destroyed, and you need buildings to shelter from the storm. Run out of buildings, and you get deleted. This is how you die in the game, for real.

This gets really frustrating when you're having a run of bad luck. Finding characters, talking to them and making ""prayers"" to build your sanctuary or ""lightning"" to destroy exit barriers is very random; sometimes you might run around like a headless chicken for 20 seconds without finding anyone to speak to (and when the time limit for each deletion attempt is 45 seconds, that's a long time!), sometimes the lightning hits the same piece of ground over, and over, and you ""waste"" valuable time trying to escape the level, sometimes the price you pay for making a mini-game error is the deletion of 80% of your sanctuary buildings (other times you get off lightly). It feels unfair at times, yet when it's going your way it feels wonderful. It's as though the developer is telling you that life sometimes sucks! 

Yet despite all this, I love the game. I really shouldn't, it does all these things that annoy me, and yet it's... it's just compelling, somehow magical, relaxing even if you're in the right frame of mind for it. If you're not, expect to rage quit! (it's CTRL+Q btw). I wouldn't blame you.",True,38,3,1412146214,N/A,Steam

Problem is, easy answers ignore the gravity of the situation. Death is confusing, especially for the living. Jason Oda’s game, Continue?9876543210, takes a long road through the mourning of a life lost, awaiting absolute termination.

Players aren’t sitting immediately with Jason Oda as they play his game, ruminating on life, death, and eternal destinations. But the invitation to enter into that tension is one that joins his longing for life and meaning at the point of death. When in mourning, we’re a mess and life isn’t fun. Death is confusing and frustrating. And the game’s metaphors are so unclear that I don’t even know what we’re mourning. Is it our own existential death? Or the death of a loved one? In the end, I don’t think it matters. What does matter is being able to mourn with those who mourn and rejoice with those who rejoice.

You are essentially dead and you're trying to put together your life and desires in this crazy afterlife inside a computer. I thought to myself ""Hell yeah, existentialism!"" Playing the game is a completely different experience, I will admit this I have not beaten the game yet. I get to the very last level and die every time, but here's the thing if you die in this particular level you restart the entire game. 

Now let me try to explain the mechanics of the game you go to a random level of ten differnet levels that you can be dropped into, you will then try to complete various tedious objectives normally involving talking to the residents in the 'town'; what you are trying to do is gain lightning and prayers from around the town you need both to win the game, the lightning will randomly destroy a piece of the blocks blocking the exits. Prayers build a safehouse in the very level I cannot get past, all while on a timer. ""What happens when this timer runs out you ask?"" Well the level will slowly be destroyed a piece at a time until you find an exit or get destroyed with it. So let me run you through it all together now: You get dropped into a town, 3 minutes to get enough lightning so that you might be able to open an exit, and get some prayers to build up your defenses in the town that will get destroyed by the computer. Oh and if you get attacked and lose a fight against one of the enemies they'll take away one of your safehouses.

So let's say you make it through all that and make it to the town (You have to go there twice to win the game) you run into a building several houses get destroyed then you have to find a new one, this goes on a couple times and then let's say you win that round, yay! You will then have to go back there in 3 more levels and you have to build up more prayers or you're not going to make it.

I tried to like this game, but I just could not get past the terrible gameplay, if there were better objectives, not such a harsh timer, or anything really, it could be playable, but it's just not.

An action/platformer that is esentially a deep meditation on the existence of video game characters, with a simplistic yet stylish look, and not to mention, a great track to accompany the whole affair.  

Once I saw it available in the Steam market, I bought it immediately (this never happens).

What I got was a little different than what I expected.

Yes, the deep philosophical message was there.  The eerie, ethereal atmosphere was there.  The melodious, calming soundtrack was there.  But gameplay was not.  At least, not what I was expecting exactly.

The game opens with a very beautiful sequence of death and transcendence into the after life (In terms of a defeated video game character).  As wonderful as this opening is, you will get very sick of it.  You will die quickly from the get go, and you will see this long cut scene each time you restart.  But the first time around, it really sets the tone and feel of what is happening.  Very melancholic and simple with an underlying complexity.  From here on out is where my feelings for this game took a turn.

From the trailer, it looked very Zelda-ish (to which I'm a sucker for.  See my review of ""Anodyne"").  This was certainly not the case.  You did not really have freedom to explore.  By freedom, I mean with enough time.  As soon as this starts, you are on a kind of timer for each world.  After a certain amount of time, the world around starts to fall apart and glitch; the system is essentially trying to delete you for good.  You have to do a lot of walking around, talking, while every once in a while being subjected to a rather lackluster battle sequence.  The point is to get out of the area you are in and move to the next area.  Now, there is also a small town in another area of the game.  It is here that you build up buildings which will also be subjected to termination.  At some point in the game (I forget when, as it has been some time since I've played this game) you go into the town.  The program starts systematically deleting the buildings.  If you get hit by a lightning bolt, you are deleted, and this results in a game over.  Then, it is time to start again, from the very beginning.

The game is rather difficult, and when I played, I found it annoyingly difficult to survive inside of the small town you construct.  No matter where I went or the buildings I had, that bolt found its way to me, resulting in an instant game over.

I might give it another go another time, but it was a big disappointment.  I like how they tried to really do something different, but in the end it wasn't fun.  I give it a perfect ten for style and music, but for gameplay...let's just say I give it a much lower score.  Maybe if it had been more free and open world, then it would have worked well.  I don't expect a Zelda knock-off AGAIN...but Anodyne seemed to manage being Zelda without being Zelda.

In this you play a video game character who got killed, but refuses to die.  Your goal is to evade the Garbage Collector, a real-life programming construct that clears out the memory of a computer when variables fall out of scope or are nullified....such as a character from a video game dying and vanishing from the landscape.   In it, a randomly generated series of worlds will be how you progress in your effort to resist death.   It felt like pixellation meets the movie Mirrormask at first, but only at first. 

It didn't take long to find myself frustrated at the lack of directional cues.   I love open world games, but this isn't one, so you need some idea of what to do next.  The devs did try to give us the appropriate clues, but much of the adventure has you staring down choices without any context for them.   An example (in logic, not actually from the game): you're running across a field and meet a merchant.  He wants to sell you a vial of cough medicine or a toaster.   Up to this point, you've seen no chance to use either a toaster or cough medicine.   You think, ""gee, medicine will help"" and buy it...only to find a villager later who wants a toaster, and the GC destroyed the world selling toasters already.   You play through that part again, make the other choice....and it turns out now it's a woman with a terrible cough who holds the key to your salvation.

The ""Nintendo Hard on Accident"" nature of the game kinda killed it for me.   It doesn't have the ability to piss you off and make you want more liek FTL and other really hard, really good games do.   You just get annoyed with the PS1 style graphics and decide Minecraft is better; after all, you can figure out the rules there.

Each playthrough is its own experience it seems, complete with a story that makes... basically no sense (at least to me). Without much backstory, or story for that matter, it left me wanting quite a lot more. The gameplay is strange as well. Game boards (or that is what I am calling them) need to be cleared in a certain time limit. If you do not, the game ends, and you have to sit through your character running away from being deleted and dying. After that, the game starts over. The in game manual, if you can call it that, kind of gives you some insight into the mechanics, but not much. 
The biggest redeeming quality of this game is the music. It is very whimsical and gorgeous. 
The worst thing about this game however, is the flashing. Possibly my computer (maybe), but in some instances of cinematics or certain effects, it is as if you are in a rave. Epileptic gamers beware.

-The instructions provided are totally inadequate.
-The controls are unredeemably bad.
-Most sections of the game have arbitrary time limits. These appear to be included solely out of spite that the developer has for you.
-A substantial portion of the game is composed of unskippable cutscenes.

It seems like the total length of the cutscenes for the total game is probably less than 20 minutes, but thanks to the awful controls you will have to replay most of them for hours before you win. Given this situation, it is probably only a matter of time before some masochist posts them online. Since the main point of the game is for you to contemplate the cutscenes, if that happens you will essentially get the substance of the 'game' for nothing.

It’s fine. Damn what a quote for the box art. But that is the most succinct way to sum it up: it’s fine. Not bad but great—fine. The core of the game is pretty interesting: “what if there was a roguelike version of Peggle?” And on that front, Pegglin is a smashing (bouncing?) success. It is exactly what is says on the tin and if that’s all you wanted to hear, congrats and enjoy! It’s a fun, easygoing time.  But as a roguelike, Peglin faulters. 

If you are familiar with the genre, you know that a roguelike lives off of variety and Peglin just can’t deliver. The game progresses over three maps littered with enemies, treasures, and mystery event spaces. After just a few hours, I had already become very familiar with basically all the options which the game could throw at me. That’s not a problem in and of itself. Plenty of amazing roguelikes don’t have wildly different levels or bosses run-to-run. The real problem emerges with the balls. After every fight, you get the option to spend some money and add one of a selection of new balls to your arsenal. Yes, haha you add balls to your arse…nal. Sorry. Anyway, none of these balls play that differently from the normal default orbs. They bounce around the board and usually deal damage. Neat. Some might have additional effects they apply to the opponent or yourself but the mechanics of throwing the balls is pretty much the same throughout.

This combined with the relatively small pool of pegboards to battle through means you will quickly get a handle on things. This leads into the other problem: it’s a very easy game. I know to many capital-G Gamers (derogatory) “easy” is the harshest criticism one can levy at a game, second only to a game’s inclusion of a black and/or female character. But to that I say: difficulty is a fairly value-neutral observation of a game. Not every game needs to shove spikes under your finger nails. That being said, with a roguelike, things are a bit different. You want roguelikes to skew just a bit more challenging to encourage replays and force the player to engage with the systems, try new builds, etc. But Peglin is pretty easy. I was able to win on my second ever run and I win runs more often than not, even on the harder ‘Cruciball’ levels. The game has a bunch of mechanics I don’t ever use because I don’t need to or the ways to utilize the mechanics are rare enough to not matter. I hope this gets changed in some future balance (ball-ance?) patch. 

Even so, I would recommend Peglin. It is a fresh idea in a very crowded genre and that should be supported.

The game is really fun when you are have a good build and a broken run. The standard difficulty is very forgiving and probably the ideal way to play the game, while the higher difficulties can be incredibly frustrating if luck isn't on your side.

I have played Desert Bus. At least when playing Desert Bus, you know youre going to have a miserable time. Theres no false hope. Peglin has every ingredient to make an awesome roguelike pachinko game, and every time I come back to it I have high hopes that this time will be different... and yet every part of it saps any possible fun out of the whole experience.

Ill keep this review short (well, Ill try) and just highlight the absolute deal-breakers, fundamental issues with the games design:

- Rigid map design that makes the pegboards look pretty, leads to ""obvious best shot"" paths. Since crit peg placement is random and usually isnt where you need it, you can probably tell exactly how much damage your shot will do before you fire it, because you know its going to roll down X Y and Z path.

- After youve used the ""obvious best shot"" path, the remaining pegs in most levels (and the orb physics) means you will struggle to do any meaningful damage. Potshots at small clusters of pegs will bounce right off and then sink straight down a clean path to the bottom, and you'll do 15 damage. So you need a refresh peg. These are randomly placed and on higher Cruciball difficulties, theres only one. There are countless peg placements in levels that were only placed there to end your run if the refresh peg lands on them. Aiming there offers no chance to deal damage, and often you need to burn 3 turns digging through obstructing pegs just to hit the refresh peg, to reset the board, to make the same boring shot you opened with.

- Theres a massive variety of orbs and relics, I would argue too many. Lots of them feel unfocused and getting a cohesive build going is rare. Its usually best to take a mish-mash of random orbs because ""theyre all better than Pebballs"" and hope you luck into one of a few game-breaking relics later. This wasnt the case in Early Access, the game just got bloated and the character additions didnt really help there.

- Enemy balance is all over the place. Even in Act 1, youve got 3 bosses, the slime boss and the Leshy are absolute run-killers for specific builds, while the Mole is a pushover and is easy enough to beat even if you didnt take a single new orb. Yet for some reason, one of the elites in Act 1 is stronger than all 3 of those bosses. Seriously. My average run-in with the Minotaur costs me -70 health, while the bosses are maybe -40 if you got unlucky? Rolling Minotaur twice in Act 1, which can happen, is an instant restart.

(That Minotaur is also a perfect example of levels that look like: ""heres a good shot, underneath the good shot is a bunch of garbage pegs, pray the refresh peg doesnt land at the bottom or your run is over because this boss hits like a truck"")

I want to love this game, I truly do. I love other games like it, love RNG based roguelikes, love Peggle, love Roundguard. But I absolutely hate this game. Every time I think I might get to have some fun with a strategy that seems to work, the game throws an encounter at you that is impossible to win if youve leaned into certain builds. Oh, you like making every peg durable? Heres an Act 3 boss that is completely unplayable with durable pegs. You like poison damage? Heres a bunch of mirror enemies that reflect damage back at you. Sucks for you, should have specced into pure DPS or non-projectile attacks instead. You want to play attrition? Act 2 boss that insta-kills you if you fail a DPS check. Theres no coincidence that the best relics in the game in EA were the ones that changed the ball physics to just yeet around at random and hit everything multiple times. Because that way guaranteed so much more damage than any natural shot you can make in many of the levels.

A huge amount of the frustration in this game could be resolved with a few changes, but they would be too drastic at this point in the games lifespan I think:

- You absolutely need to be able to sacrifice a turn (or even a whole Orb belt) to refresh the board at any time. Cuts out the RNG dependency on good refresh placements, turns a bad roll into a loss of 1 turn rather than 5 turns of pain and suffering.

- Pegboards need some serious rethinking, to lead to both more interesting shots and less ""dead turns"" that you know wont achieve anything. Orb physics is included here, it should be easier to fire into a space and rack up acceptable damage even after the ""obvious good shot"" is gone. Maybe the fewer pegs there are remaining on the board, the better the crit peg becomes? If half the pegs are gone, they become X2 or something and keep getting better.",False,9,1,1757771261,N/A,Steam
Gordian Quest,1296610,13.99,0,solo,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198413658244,"An unpolished disappointment. The concept of a rogue-lite peggle game is obviously very widely appealing, however the game feels like several good ideas all terribly executed. The game is, by the nature of roguelikes, very luck based. This isn't inherently bad but the issue emerges in the actual peggle gameplay sections. The movement of the ""pegballs"" is erratic to the point of pure luck. Aiming has so little influence over the movement of the shot that it's arguably useless as a mechanic. The game contains three areas which all have predefined paths, but randomised events. The navigation is done THROUGH a peggle section which is a good decision, but is victim to the aforementioned unpredictable ball movement, which whilst conceptually aligns with the concepts and themes of the genre, feels unfair and un-fun to play with, rather than a reasonable element of randomisation. The lack of randomisation for the core layout of each area and doing the same three areas in the same three orders results in your upwards of 80 MINIMUM runs required for completion feeling VERY samey within a very short time.

The game going for a pixel art aesthetic is a unique and risky approach for a game so fundamentally built around circles and perhaps it's my fault for playing on a Steamdeck but the entire game has pixel stretching which hurts both the aesthetics and the aforementioned aiming. On top of this graphics regarding overworld travel seem unfinished, very very empty pre-defined maps with little detailing beyond a core layout.

The game uses a stepped difficulty system, where each tier is unlocked after completion of the previous, up to a total of 20 tiers. I at the time of writing have reached ""Cruciball 7"" and am completely tired of the game. The game has already exhausted most if not all of its unique quirks and has devolved into a repetitive grind, as not only is there the difficulty system but there is ALSO a Bestiary section that contains all the enemies and must be completed by obtaining rather infrequent item drops from said enemy, but with enemies being locked behind areas and all areas being restricted to a set order, it makes finishing much later Bestiary entries a similarly irritating grind. Whilst it's not applicable to all players, the completionist grind ALSO contains completing the highest tier of difficulty with all four unlockable characters AND all items/balls.

The game has a good concept but bogs itself down with unnecessary grinding and RNG mechanics that need tweaking. The features that imply an incentive for 100% completion that devolve into an unrelenting grind hurt the game more than any amount of unbalanced mechanics could. I would recommend holding off until more is done to mitigate these issues if your interest in this game stems from your interest in the original Peggle like mine did. If you're more interested in the game as a roguelike first, I'd be weary and do your own research before purchasing.",False,1,0,1757009173,N/A,Steam

Gordian Quest,1296610,13.99,0,solo,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198047242873,"Listen, I adore this game - it feels so, so wrong to be giving it a negative review. But, I need you to understand what it's like to actually own this game after having put some hours in and learning to appreciate it. 

     It's like this. You look through your library and find ""Oh, Peglin, I used to love this game, why did I stop playing it?"" So you drop back in and you blaze through boss after boss - and quickly you remember how all the relics stack with different balls for MASSIVE DAMAGE. 

    So you get creative, you try and have a little fun. You try to make builds that scale with the amount of damage you've taken. Or utilize the reload mechanic to your advantage. It takes some luck to get the right items together, sure, but there's a few ways to get the same or similar effects so if you're clever enough you can make most things work in most runs... or at least pivot to something else similar or similarly interesting. It's great like that, encouraging you to try new things by giving you stuff that's, maybe, not what you were hoping for but ""if I pick this up, it might stack with that, and this"" and suddenly you have a new favorite build you're trying to create.

   But, then you see him, the wall of stone, one of three bosses for the second phase; the fun killer. You have two choices - either restart and hope for better luck on the next try - or push ahead hoping the stars align and maybe you'll get exactly what you need to beat him even though it will probably mean completely sacking whatever fun strategy you had been building to pivot into direct attack strength.

  Let me be clear, it's not that he's difficult - he's relatively easy if you build out for DPS, but the game is full of all these ways to do things other than pure DPS. It's a shame almost none of those are remotely effective against the wall. If you try turning armor into attack, well you better do it really fast because if he reaches you before you can do 4k damage - it's game over. Specked yourself to turn damage into attack and heal with pegs? That's a really fun strat, but he doesn't attack so you're limited to what self damage you can inflict. Besides, none of that is gunna be practical above, like, crusiball 7 anyway. Maybe, maybe you use the binding mechanic to hold him back for just a little more time? Hah, nope - he's immune to that too. 

 What this means is, basically, the further you get in the games progression, the more you'll need to limit yourself to the more direct DPS options to beat the wall..

    Regardless, it's just one run, right? Next time you can do something fun and interesting. So, It's fine. You just got unlucky - it happens. But then you get him again, and again. And you realize - theres only like 3 bosses in the second stage so you have a 1/3 chance of getting this boss every time. The boss that requires pure DPS to beat. Who's only attack is an instant kill so you can't turn his attacks into damage. Using reloading mechanics only speeds up his advance so that's out. He's the fun killer. Whatever you thought you were gunna do, you're not doing it any more - you're either a DPS build now or you're starting over in the forest. Again.
 
 And this, ultimately, is the problem. It's not that this boss exists - it's that he appears so frequently it's feels less like ""oh, darn I got unlucky"" and more like - ""hmmm, if I want to progress further I guess I'll just have to stop trying to use these really cool and novel mechanics and just stick to obvious combos with high base/crit &/or lots of bombs"". 

    And you remember that, this, this is why you stopped playing before. 

   And you wonder - are the dev's ever gunna do something about this? Are they ever gunna reduce his odds of appearing or add something to his fight that enables more interesting play styles than pure DPS to get past him? Maybe some day. But, today, I guess I'll just stop playing.",False,53,2,1756524088,N/A,Steam

The game does not give you the ability to adequately gain strength to a degree that can contend with the rapid difficulty spikes of Act 2 and 3. I have over 70 hours at the time of writing and not once have gotten lucky enough to pass Cruciball 10.

Because of this, combined with a distinct lack of meaningful meta progression, means that the fun build variety you'd usually get out of roguelikes does not actually exist. A lot of ""upgrades"" (often received from fighting bosses) come with downsides that far outweigh the positives they could ever give you.

A lot of pegboard layouts focus far more on the theme of the encounter than actual play-ability. There are many where a single bad Refresh peg spawn can end entire runs and others that practically require specific balls or upgrades to even contend with, resulting in very unsatisfying deaths.

For the price, it isn't worth it. If the devs ever show interest in levelling the playing field then I'd consider picking it up, but until then save your money for a game that respects your time investment and allows you to interact with the tools it has on offer in fun and impactful ways.

Gordian Quest,1296610,13.99,0,solo,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198265458912,"As a big fan of Peggle and also various rogue-like/rogue-lite games, I tried really really REALLY hard to like this game. However, the honeymoon phase wears off incredibly quickly, and the clashing game design elements very quickly begin to become frustrating, and the core game play loop repetitive and boring.

Like many rogue-likes, this game features crucible/ascension/whatever you wanna call it: scaling difficulty. It is not enough to beat the game, you have to beat it 20 times per character on increasing levels of difficulty. In many rogue-likes, this offers a nice challenge; as you get better at the game, its difficulty increases and you're forced to use resources more efficiency, create stronger builds, and so on. Unlike, Balatro or Slay the Spire, which this game desperately tries to copy every mechanic from, it doesn't seem that skill alone is enough to beat the game starting around 10+ ""cruciball"". Whether or not you can win is almost entirely determined by beating the Act 1 boss. 

That is, unless you randomly encounter one of many ""fuck you""'s this game has to offer further down the road. For example, there is an encounter in the last act that features a board with only 1 peg on the screen that spawns another peg when hit, that spawns another when hit, etc. Did you pick up the relic that makes it so you shoot from 2 predetermined locations with no way to actually aim? LOL sucks to be you, lose instantly! This is not an exaggeration and just one of many ways you can at the very least lose half your health, or flat out lose an extremely promising run instantly, by rolling an enemy or situation against which there is practically no counter play with your current build. 

This just begs the question, what's the point of a game with almost all of its core mechanics being luck based and random, including drops, draw order, enemies, to some extent even how much damage your able to deal per turn, if making the wrong ""choice"" is so incredibly punishing? This game would be so much more fun if, like Peggle (the game the pachinko mechanic it was based on), it focused on being fun and feel rewarding for the player rather than trying to be a serious, punishing rogue-like.

This game does have problems though, as others have pointed out this is a relatively 'solved' game at harder difficulties, and it's likely due to Peggle being a poor translation for an ascension focused deckbuilder. There are not a lot options for orbs that will have a positive effect on your run, and the boss relics are situational at best but usually a skip. Skipping most of your run because anything you add would actively harm you is not enjoyable difficulty.

The games concept is fun, the gameplay loop that they created is fun, and since bigger number always means better person- it has to mean better game too, the damage you do can scale insanely high. I just wish they put more effort into the difficulty settings.

It's a simple and fun little game. It tends to be my go-to when I want something I can do that doesn't require active brain power and it doesn't have any sort of timer for anything. I like to idle-y play it while yapping or watching something. It's like a rouge-like version of Peggle, and I feel like they could do more with the concept. 

The game isn't ""difficult"" per say, but it isn't really that rewarding, either. After you defeat a normal encounter stage, you don't really get a reward. You get an option to *buy* rewards. You can buy a heal, buy a new orbs out of 3 randomly picked ones, or buy an upgrade for one of your current orbs. You can get free relics after beating an elite or boss encounter, and there's some events in the ""?"" rooms where you can get free relics or items/upgrades, but most normal encounters just.. don't feel worth completing. You fight enemies, and your reward is the option to purchase your ""reward""?

There isn't a lot of build variety. Some orbs and relics do different things, but the gameplay is almost always the same. You could *try* to go for a unique build, like a Ballwark (this game's shields) or a Spinfection (this game's poison) build, but the relics and orbs that even give that effect is so few and far between, and the ones you do have don't offer a lot. Which also sucks because 2 of the unlockable characters in the game are locked behind these effects (one by ending a battle with 100 Ballwark and one  by having 50 Spinfection on an enemy). It feels like you need an absolutely perfect run to even *hope* to unlock these characters, or even use the effects to begin with. There's so many different niches of effects that orbs can offer you, but most of them don't really have a good synergy with one another and you just end up with either a collection of orbs that do nothing to work together and just clog your loadout, or you end up with only like 4 or 6 orbs because you're trying to go for a specific build and there just.. *isn't* the orbs or relics available to make just that build feasible.

It feels almost like the game is too basic for it's own good, but it's trying to be a more difficult rouge-like and it makes it hard for someone who just wants to play it casually to play it for longer than a run every once and awhile. It has potential, and it has the charm, but at this current point it's just so plain and boring. For a $20 game, I would expect having more to bite and chew on.

I'd pick this game up if it was on a decent sale, but I can't justify recommending it at full price. Not in this current state.

There are a lot of balls (in a deck builder this would be the cards) and not all of them are good and some of them are situational, I can understand that that is part of the Roguelike genre, but the way that the increase in difficulty setting (also comon in all Roguelike games) makes a lot of the balls not useful or not good. So you are just fishing for a few balls and since it is hard to remove balls it is hard to justify getting new balls that don't fit 100%

Relics are the best part of builds since they do make it more intreasting I will admit.

I suppose a lot of it comes down to feeling less control and robbed of vistory or winning only because your lucky and not because you have a luck based build.

There are so many boards that will either cripple you or will snowball you to victory and it feels more luck based or rather harder to express skill when the pins phase in or out of existence, move around a lot, change starting positions, slow your ball down massively or black holes that just suck everything in.

This gives me a feeling of ""oh I won"" or ""that felt like bullshit"". it does not give feelings of overcoming a hard boss by making do with what you got or enjoy a really cool niche build that might not always work but is really fun to pull off like I get in other Roguelikes.

There is also the completion metric which is a grind fest not worth time along with achievements that are annoying to achieve and fit more into the ""oh this has a 1% chance of happening every run, good luck"" rather then a ""you managed"" or a ""have gotten very relic/ball""

Boss relics are hot trash (a known issue since early access), the new bosses (Leshy and Pigment of Imagination) are massively overtuned still, and Cruciball 10+ (arguably 5+ or even lower) are incredibly frustrating and not fun.

Runs even on lower Cruciball levels can be extremely rng due to the relic pool drowning in garbage, extremely poor boss balance, terrible fight design (the ghost in the mines that only spawns a couple pegs every turn/refresh while hitting you constantly), among myriad other reasons.

Build variety is also nearly nonexistent. The pool of useful relics, especially those that kick-start your run, is dreadfully shallow, with most relics offering only small situational benefits, require a lot of work or synergy to accomplish anything, or the absolutely insulting +1/+0 and +0/+1 relics. Tragically, those latter two relics are actually decent-to-good to get early on because they bolster the godawful Pebball stats.

Now, I suppose to be fair, Slay the Spire also has problems with having some aggressively bad or really middling relics, a lot of iffy cards that require a magical Christmasland scenario to pop off, and some fights that are just aggravating.

I like the concept, the base gameplay idea is fun, but as others have said, the balance, pacing, and uneven difficulty is not. It does very much feel like the devs 'test' the game, but they don't /play/ it.

The RNG grinding is horrible, you can spend hours starting a new game over and over trying to find the -singular- relic you need that allows you to unlock one class, and I still have yet to find it.

The bounce physics are atrocious, the initial launch and first bounce actually GAIN impulse, meaning your shots will rarely, if ever go where you would logically presume they would go in any other physics engine. Shoot it at a low angle at the corner to go down that column? Nah fam, we're bouncing to the other side of the screen at double velocity and immediately meteoring down the empty shaft.

You'll spend more time trying to get rid of the stupid starting balls you get because they are absolutely worthless, and a significant portion of the ? events on the map actually try to give you more of the basic orbs, which... Just... Why? Why would I want three events all offering to give me 3 more pebballs? No.

The worst and probably most painful insult to injury though is that you cannot unlock the additional characters in custom start, which given how inconsistent games are, and the sheer lack of synergistic items to accumulate shield or slime effects means progression is entirely RNG and there is no way to mitigate or work around it to unlock items through playtime or other effects.

I don't get angry very often and it takes alot to get me there and It's actually an incredibly fun game UNTIL you get around cruciball 15-ish but I don't think anything outside of real life issues has ever made me more upset than the later cruciball modes. you WILL hate yourself if you play this game and try to 100% it. Me and my friends have an inside joke about me playing darkest dungeon where i genuinely have the worst luck out of everybody in the entire universe for just that game but it pales in comparison to peglin. this game made me cry multiple times. fucking NOITA hasn't made me cry and that game is fucking ridiculously hard and unfair. I beat noita one time in over a hundred hours and that was because i literally got a combination of items that made me unkillable and i STILL almost lost. moral of the story don't play this if you try to complete games, like yourself or fun, or dislike yourself or fun. at the very least if you do play peglin i implore you do NOT try to beat all the cruciballs unless you win the lottery every week or something. I tried to be atleast a little funny while being as honest as I could about my experience to try and make myself feel better while I write this review but I genuinely cannot overstate how much I don't find this game fun anymore and every time I play I'm reminded of why I stopped.

After Cruciball 15+, this game becomes a grind of, ""hope you can get lucky with the right combination of orbs/relics, otherwise you'll lose for the 25/26/27th time in a row.""

Thd game is plagued with the ""death spiral"" as others mentioned, and the orb/relic selection becomes too random to be benefial at higher Cruciball levels. I understand the purpose of the game becoming more difficult, but there needs to be some re-work of just about everything if they want this game to be any fun at higher levels. I can't even count the number of times I've had (what I thought to be) an amazing built, only for a simple fight in Act 2 or 3 to counter the build entirely.

Horrible refresh placements, orb/relic options that do nothing for your build, and enemies/boss fights that you're powerless to do anything about (unless you have that one SPECIFIC build) are all reasons I'm slowly pulling away from this game. I've managed to crawl my way to C18 on a couple characters, but its always followed by 10+ failed runs before a win.

It truly is an incredibly fun game to play at lower levels, just don't expect to feel any joy whatsoever past C15. 

4/10, if the devs bump the difficultly scale down a touch, or even give players SOME form of support towards the ending Cruciballs, this score can change.

Edit 7/9/25 - I currently have 50+ losses in a row on Cruciball levels 17+ between my Steam account and mobile.

I am sucker for religious paintings or perhaps enjoy romantizing martyrdom, this game succeeds in bringing a captivating beauty through misery. 
Speaking of misery, the gameplay of course takes large inspiration for Metroid and Dark souls. The game does well in making the game feel tough during certain bosses, though after a point it does become easier (I say in better or for worse terms.) The gameplay admittedly didn't sway me, if I had never played a Mouls-like or a metroidvania, it would be completely fresh to me but only recycles these ideas and I am afraid to say doesn't bring much to table in terms of new ideas. The gameplay itself does feel almost like an IGN review of an indy game. BUT, the game's atmosphere, and story is where the game begins to shine and find it's identity. It's a fun (though maybe Blasphemous,) retelling of Christ. The Penitent One goes into world to free it from suffering. Though in this game it's done by violence and not by kindness. It's an interesting and grim retelling of my beliefs. It's hopeful enough to not feel like an edgy gorefest and bleak enough to feel impactful. There is some gripes I do have with the story, but since I haven't played the sequel, I think it is best if I bite my tounge for now. I would give it probably a 7.5/10.",True,0,0,1764079754,N/A,Steam

You play as the Penitent One, exploring a twisted land called Cvstodia, fighting grotesque monsters, and uncovering deep, sorrow‑laden secrets.

Pros:

Stunning pixel art and a haunting, atmospheric world.

Hard-hitting, rewarding boss fights and combat.

Lots of build variety through relics, prayers, and abilities.

Rich, dark lore that feels unique and deeply unsettling.

Cons:

Platforming can feel finicky and punishing at times.

Some instant-death traps and cheap spike placements frustrate players.

Backtracking is often required, and fast-travel isn’t super generous.

The learning curve is steep; not super forgiving for newcomers.

Realistic Score: ~8.5/10 — It’s not perfect, but for fans of challenging action-metroidvanias with incredible style and atmosphere, Blasphemous is a deeply satisfying journey. Most players are very positive about it, but be ready for a dark, demanding ride.",True,0,0,1764043238,N/A,Steam
TROUBLESHOOTER,774361,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198042497186,"Blasphemous is a Metroidvania developed by Spanish studio The Game Kitchen, a game that was successfully kick-started and a game I had my eye on since it was announced. 

I originally played this back on my switch but have picked it up again after many years. I remember really liking this game but remember seeing some reactions being a bit more lukewarm at the time, I do feel reception is certainly more positive and since replaying it on steam it's probably one of my favourites in the genre. It's a bit dark souls, a bit castlevania and a lot of Spanish Catholicism. 

I think the first thing that needs to be mentioned is the striking visual style, it's pixel art but it's absolutely gorgeous with incredible detail and design. The real star is the incredible art design, as mentioned above it's heavily inspired by Spanish Catholic iconography and this really helps create a unique and disturbing world. It's sin meets penitence in which the whole world seems to be in state of forgiveness whilst also undergoing bizarre and cruel punishments to atone for their sins. This point is really driven in when you discover you're playing as the The Penitent one, a mysterious silent figure that's looking for atonement. 

Gameplay is quite a rudimentary Metroidvania but this isn't a negative, it's the refinement of the formula that puts this game in high regards, the map is incredibly well designed, there are loads of secrets and quests with lots of interwoven paths. I genuinely enjoyed every biome in this game as they are deeply intriguing and fun to explore. It does have the typical health, magic and damage upgrades but thankfully you aren't hunting down heart fragments. You just get the upgrade when you find them which is nice. 

Combat is fun but does feel simplistic, it has a wide variety of moves you can unlock which are all basically useless and a magic system which is fairly simple. It's again not a bad thing and the extra tools are nice but don't seems necessarily useless to get through the game, the real fun comes from mastering the parry system and knowing when to strike, it has that slow deliberate dark souls style combat with you losing out on your magic meter if you die. It's not salt and sanctuary levels of 2d dark souls (god I hope these comparisons are making sense) but it does have that dark souls dna. 

Platforming is very basic and I see some discourse still exists around the clunky movement, I don't think this is an issue personally but the lack of mobility upgrades does mean you won't be double jumping around the map any time soon, there are a small handful of mobility upgrades but they come so late and they are optional meaning you can miss out on a lot of game. Also the one hit kill spikes are the worst. 

With all that said this is a fantastic metroidvania and one I think anyone who seriously enjoys the genre need to play. One of my favourites and I it's not a sin to admit it.",True,0,0,1764029276,N/A,Steam

It is a brutal, beautiful, and essential masterpiece for fans of dark fantasy.

Graphics and Visuals: At the peak of modern pixel art. The world of Cvstodia is a breathtaking nightmare of baroque architecture, grotesque monsters, and meticulous detail. The animations are fluid, impactful, and intensely visceral and stunning.

Music and Sound: World-class. The soundtrack features mournful pieces with Spanish and religious undertones, creating a heavy atmosphere filled with dread. The combat sound effects make the sword strikes feel weighty and responsive.

Mechanics and Gameplay: A perfect blend of Metroidvania and Souls-like. The combat system is precise and unforgiving, emphasizing parrying, dodging, and correct timing. The use of the Fervour meter for powerful abilities adds a strategic layer.

Exploration and Narrative: The map design is clever and full of secrets. Discovering shortcuts and new items is highly rewarding. The game's lore, conveyed through environmental details and item descriptions, possesses a terrifying depth and allure.

Even though I'd bounced off it the first time playing it, I recently came back to finally experience it fully. Is it a perfect experience? No. But there's a lot here to make it perfectly memorable.
First off, the story. Wow. Inherently tied to its design, Blasphemous tells a story about guilt and its twisted power, using Catholic mythology and aesthetics, but transforming that into its own thing. The world, characters and lore are simply phenomenal and very original. It's a joy to explore this world and uncover its secrets and twisting pathways. There's a giant cathedral, a buried enormous bell, and many many decrepit churches, either underground or atop frozen peaks with sculpted faces. Everything is so gothic and so beautiful to just look at and every location fits very well into the world of Cvstodia. The Penitent One is also a great protagonist, silent for a reason and deadly for another. He feels really good to control and move around, and every swing of the blade or step you make is beautifully enriched by excellent sound design. To this I'll point you to the OST by Carlos Viola, which is incredibly good. It fits the mood perfectly.
There's lots of secrets and collectibles to find too, and while I've had my fun backtracking to explore everything, I felt that by the end it was becoming tedious and there's stuff hidden behind a DLC which can only be experienced in NG+. This means one playthrough isn't enough to experience everything, which is made worse by the incredibly cryptic quest design. If you don't know where to go, what to get and who to speak to, you'll never get the actual true ending to this tale, so I recommend you use a guide. This is similar to Dark Souls nonsense and I was never a big fan of this approach, but I forgive it because artistically I just find it all so inspiring.
Ultimately this truly felt like a pilgrimage inside a world ruled by pain. The lore and setting here are unforgettable, even if the gameplay style isn't your thing. It's a really fun time too, but I felt it overstayed its welcome slightly by the end.

I just reached the last boss's second phase a few minuets ago... and I was done. I quit the game and uninstalled it on the spot.

I wasted so much time dumping Tears of Atonement (Souls) into every move in the Combo Tree, Charged Tree, Vertical Tree, and Lunge Tree.
But against the final boss?
All I could really use were Ranged Tree shots, single upward hits, and if I got lucky, maybe two horizontal swipes from those appearing-and-disappearing platforms.
This isn't fun. It's not even hard. It's just tedious AF, with luck dictating where and when those platforms spawn. It doesn't test skill or give me any real choice in how I want to beat the boss. And god damn, what's with this creatively bankrupt move of slapping a boss with a bazillion, and I mean a qazillion, health points? 

The game was enjoyable once I unlocked some abilities. I don't care much about the story, but the world design is really cool, even if it's nothing new. It's basically Dark Souls with a fresh Halloween theme. I'm not big into platforming, but it was all decent enough.

What fascinates me about souls-likes is the world-building and exploration, plus how satisfying experience (Souls) collection and farming feels. I love grabbing new abilities and blasting through bosses as quickly as possible.

Getting stuck on one absolutely kills the game for me. In my opinion, bosses should just be a bit tougher than the regular mobs, and the final boss a notch stronger than the rest... that's it. I couldn't care less about these brain-dead World of Warcraft-style encounters where you battle some god-like creator for two or three hours straight.

At the end of the day, having fun is the number one priority in games. And the beginning and ending of this games hasn't much of fun in it, but great middle.

TROUBLESHOOTER,774361,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198073544498,"This one pains me to vote down because it does so much right! I am a fan of metroidvanias, from the old to the new, and it is important to establish that this most definitely is one, contrary to any claims of being a souls-like that some may make, so don't go in with false expectations. As a metroidvania though, it leaves a lot to be desired, as those moments of both character and exploration progression are few and far between. 

As for character progression, there are no levels and so most improvements come as upgrades. Not unusual, but man, these upgrades do nothing. Every enemy takes half a dozen hits, and the many items you get don't make you any stronger or make any appreciable difference, especially since the flavor text muddles what everything does. That is especially odd since the items also have a lore section you can switch to, so the verisimilitude feels like a poor choice. It was said in another review, but there really is no difference in your gameplay as the game progresses, and that sucks because this gameplay just ain't it. 

Inputs feel clunky and slow, and there is so much input bleed, especially in moves with combined inputs like dash-stabbing. That move is especially heinous, as I died countless times because my character just stopped and slowly slashed in place, whilst the dodge refused to cancel anything or even come out. Even the four hit combo I unlocked rarely makes an appearance despite the requirement being to hit 'K' four times. The dodge is also just awful, since its ability to pass through enemies and projectiles is often unclear, and after a dodge it acts like it has a 1 second cooldown before you can even use it again, so any bullet hell elements or crowds of enemies just stink to get through. There is a parry, but it feels like a band aid, and again it is unclear what it is and isn't fair game to parry. Mobility in general isn't great, and the game is not forthcoming in fast ways to get across the map. Instead you have to trudge through enemies aplenty.

The enemies are a mixed bag. They are okay in terms of mechanical design, though some such as the shield enemies feel they exist entirely to slow you down further and waste more time. I never thought any were really challenging except for maybe the teleporting wax ghost that shoots high damage lasers. Awful, just awful to face, and gimmicky to deal with. Bosses are a tad dull, or in the case of the second boss, set up to be annoying and tanky. That entire fight is just running back and forth before hopping around jump slashing. Jump slashing is not fun by the way, and you can't help but feel like you are doing something wrong. As mentioned, having to pass through these guys over and over is such a chore, especially given how many of these rooms are designed like puzzles, so you have to dodge your way through every single time just to get to the other side.

A quick note about traversal: it isn't rewarding, and unlocking new areas isn't usually because of the application of a particular item, but instead because you went around. That's fine on its own, but with the amount of items I am picking up, it would be nice if at least one let me glide or double dodge or something.

On a positive note the game truly is gorgeous. The animations, especially on the nun with the giant incense flail, are amazing and really impressive use of pixel animation. The choice to lean into the late medieval Christian obsession with saintly body parts, penance, and ordained suffering makes the world feel unique and yet darkly familiar. In real life those body parts are still held by the Catholic Church, and it makes this world feel both macabre in a way that only human inflicted suffering can bring about, and alive with a history and culture that everyone participates in. I think the devs get an A+ for bringing something incredible to life here.

Would I prefer that the game had not been made, or at least, that another was made instead? No, I think this game is invaluable as a piece of art and expression through game design. Clearly a lot of people do not share my concerns or feel that these issues are notable enough. I just wanted more from this game. I got it on a very generous sale, though the price tends to be quite high for what it is. Maybe that is a sensibility from an older era when metroidvanias were considered less equivocal to other game genres, even on platforms like steam, and were priced around the $10-15 range digitally. If the gameplay was tighter, I think this game is worth full price, but for those who aren't going to be satisfied with a game that just looks cool, a sale of any kind brings it to a more justified cost.",False,0,0,1761798438,N/A,Steam

However, rather than being engaged by it's difficulty, the combat felt very clunky and monotonous. Getting damaged because your pixel touched a peasant's cloak, and spending ages running through hallways with the same peasants and ghosts didn't at all grip me. It's hard to even blame the game, it's just doing what it seems like every platformer since the original Super Mario's have been doing, but to me it just feels extremely odd to play a genre that seems to refuse to innovate and question why certain senseless, unintuitive and dated mechanics are in these games, without critically thinking on whether it actually serves to guide the player into a fun playstyle. Considering this game is so well reviewed, I am obviously in the minority, but to those who don't play a lot of platformers be aware. The game, likely unsurprisingly, feels very dated and slow. Hopefully the second game, or some other platformer, attempts to make fluid, fast and engaging combat, with enemies that push the player to take on a fun playstyle, and without the mind-numbing miles of corridors filled with chaff and random doorways that lead to more winding hallways and bogs that loop and lead off from each other, making you realise once you open the map you will be going through the entire route again to go to the other random doorway that you only pray is short and not littered with ghosts throwing projectiles and peasants that dare you to touch a single of their pixels with your own, lest you die from the agony of the mistake.

Тіпа, ну платформінг не так бісить тепер, як він бісив на релізі, але от всі інші криві моменти як були, так і лишились.

1. No i-frames on dodge, so the game compensates by making the bosses easier
2. Traveling on the map is horrendous until the very late-game, moving from one end to another just to spend more time in the game. Now don't get me wrong, I like going back to the first levels and rediscovering stuff, but this game just makes you go from one end to another for almost nothing
3. No hints on how to unlock fast travel between respawn points
4. No way to know if you completed a room or even a zone
5. Hardest zone is made overly difficult for no real reason and it feels kinda weird to be ready to fight the last boss but some random mob can 2 shot you, while the boss needs ~4-5 hits, without you needing to parkour around him
6. Making a platformer time-based speed-run puzzle part of the progression but having janky controls (at least on the steam deck) is a big no-no from me:
- for attacking to latch onto platforms, you can only do it in the exact location of the dedicated area. It doesn't matter if you are in the attack animation while in the zone or if you spam attack in the zone
- regarding latching onto edges, you can't latch to all of them and it's not obvious which ones are latch-able. Even when trying to latch, if you're in a different animation, you won't latch
- death zone hit box is bigger than the graphical description (the spikes) and not consistent

I'd only recommend for the story and visuals but NOT for the gameplay

I was apart of every major battle in the game's history and have seen every ""it's so over"" and ""were so back"" moments of the community, and despite how much I love this game I cannot in good conscience give this game a good review. 

This isn't because of the games fault, but rather the dev team who have time and time again proven their incompetent, and sometimes malicious approach at maintaining this game. Some things can be forgiven like: using an engine that would soon be discontinued, minor bugs on an updates release, balance being slightly off on new content, etc. However, due to what I can only assume is their ego they dev's have: completely ravaged the game with content that is not play-tested making balance and bug fixing a nightmare, lying to community about actual balance changes and notable nerfs they claim to be buffs, creating enemies that spit in the face of the games original design philosophy, and letting performance get so bad to the point that people, who paid for this game mind you, have had their computer's hard crash multiple times due to the amount of tech debt they seemingly refuse to meaningfully chip at. 

They also have seemingly no respect for the community for anything other than content. People have been begging the devs to fix bouncing strategems and revert the hellpod maneuverability for ages, and despite it being a literal toggleable option in the code they refuse to do so, but they need to listen to the community and add caves that barely function, with enemies that barely function, on a world designed to frustrate the player, because that was what the players wanted. Then you have the fact the treat their content creators horribly with creators being kicked from their program because they criticized the game in a way the devs didn't like, or lead one on for months only to tell him to fuck off later on. 

If they actually listened to the community in any meaningful way, and stop trying to force the game into being a ""grunt fantasy"" with shitty weapons, overpowered enemies, and bad game design, they wouldn't have lost like 200k players in the span of a few months.

After 200 hrs on PS5, I refuse to start from scratch, because of Sony's incompetence. Unacceptable.",False,3,0,1764113126,N/A,Steam

Gameplay loop is engaging and the battle pass system in the game is generous and free-to-play friendly. Some say the balance is off-whack, but I think it adds to the more casual nature of the game. I have little qualms about the game itself; it is amazing and I applaud the devs for the years of development that went into this modern live-service masterpiece.

With that said...

The optimization is extremely subpar; game literally shuts down my PC with no BSOD. Helldivers 2 is the only game that does this on my setup. The game literally screws with the HARDWARE of my computer, which mind you, is fairly beefy and was built a year or so ago as of writing this review. The anti-cheat in the game might also have something to do with this.

Also, 130GB+ storage space is appalling when on consoles it is less than half of that. Its not worth saving 130GB of space on a game that has the potential to kill your computer without warning.

Don't get me wrong, it's super addictive once you get the hang of it and it's fun to make and test various builds, boon crafting is a rewarding process. It's just that the game seems to have little frustrations implemented here and there for the sake of frustrating you. They're not narratively engaging or interesting. Without spoiling much, after the grind when you finally feel like you have conquered a certain realm or biome, and you clear it up more consistently, it just suddently gets tougher for no reason and all your progression is thrown out the window, and you have to work your way up again, I suppose they did this because otherwise the game will be super short, like it would have 5 hours of content max, but with their little trolling system thy can squeeze 20 or 30+ hours of your time. 

So yeah, very fun and addictive gameloop, but I wouldn't recommend if you don't like unecessary hard difficulty.

but for the life of me, i can't say i like this game and could reccomend it when it had became the unfinished mess it is now, full of too much ambition and broken promises, and a terrible multiplayer model for a system not needed on a game meant to be a flagship title for a launching console.

we were promised many things, and many things later. they insisted to us it's the most halo they've made for halo.
hmmmm, what did they all do?

some halo fans didnt like that the classic shotgun got replaced overall in the sandbox with a new shotgun. then they said they'll just add it in an update. we never got the classic shotgun, but we did get some stupid fucking brute shotgun that belongs in doom. it's cool, but it honestly doesnt feel like a halo weapon, if im holding it im playing fucking doom.

support for the coop campaign got cut. they added it, but they didnt give us the other features campaign should have had. no replayable missions, no story dlc to continue the story after the cool cliffhangar we got, campaign support being cut also means no new sandbox weapons are being added to the campaign, and that's kind of stupid; it kills the replay value. i would have liked to see the weapon sandbox fit and update with the multiplayer, and even some followups for the jokes of 'seasons' they had. they eventually said fuck that and went to 'operations' because they thought fomo works or some dumb shit like that.

our store was just a place of overpriced bundles and by the time we got free currency, they make any decent items too fucking grindy to get, and also made promo items grindy, and offered you to buy the free currency to get them, but im not going to fall for that shitty marketing tactic.

desync still fucking exists and will show when you load up firefight and see everyone using only rockets and turn the match into a michael bay film.

gunplay, i understand that some people early on insist it's the best gunplay, and while i agree its satisfying, sometimes, compared to halo 3, it's not as smooth and way more jank than 3.

i really did like the armor abilities and how they used them in multiplayer, i thought that was executed well. though i feel like the campaign should have just had you scavenge for the abilities around and just accumulate the different gadgets instead of just making them suit upgrades. after all, i would like to feel like im playing halo, and fucking not far cry spiderman gear rising revangance; reign of the big bad guy's sad bald husband, though the campaign statement can be chalked up to personal gripe and opinion.

my takeaway from the armor abilities is changing dome shield then saying amped wall from titanfall replaces it, then pretend to bring it back and give us a useless sphere that nobody will walk up to

when promoting the hayabusa helmet coming back, they should have just made it a fucking login reward. i dont give a goddamn fuck if it said ""earn spartan points"" IN A SENTENCE AFTER SAYING IT'S FREE, THEY DIDNT SAY SHIT ABOUT HAVING TO GRIND FOR IT, I'M NOT GONNA WASTE MY TIME ON THIS DOGSHIT JOKE OF A 'HALO' TITLE

now i understand that some people feel like this is the best halo campaign but it really isnt to be honest.

there's some neat emotional tugging moments, yes, but it's done so much 343 fanfic for the story i just cant say the campaign was good. i personally fucking felt it could have been better. we could have had better battles, a better setting, but they didnt want to offend anyone from what it looks like. you scooby doo chase a villain through his various BIG IMPORTANT FORTRESS WITH ALOT OF BAD GUYS and then hear about 10 glazing atriox speeches and hear a banished bad guy go ""hello master chief i am going to fight you now, i tortured alot of the good guys""
i honestly would have loved an introductory mission where you're aboard the infinity, chief is geared up, and he is getting ready to approach the new halo ring. then the infinity gets into this cool space battle, but its also brought a small fleet with them as well, so a cool space battle ensues, as the banished is fighting with their ragtag group of upgraded ships, before chief then flies into a banished ship carrying atriox and starts running a crazy assault on the banished flagship, eventually destroying it from the inside and getting into a cool beefy fight with atriox before their fight goes unfinished and they separate from the ship tearing itself apart as it crashes onto the halo ring, before they eventually separate on different paths to spiral into some events like chief going to retrieve the weapon, then he's racing to get to cortana while also trying to chase the banished, chief gets support from some fellow marines but as chief retrieves the weapon, the infinity crashes, and now the spartans (and maybe some mp spartans like yours) need to defend the infinity, establish themselves on the ring fight the banished and finish the fight. idk i wanted a story to be very much halo feeling and have it come full circle where chief fights atriox, then has to deal with cortana and get her to stop oppressing the galaxy in some cool epic finale where chief has to stop her and eventually put her in some ai lockup or something. 

instead, 343 fanfic comes in, and does it's ritual of mollywhopping chief yet again by space kratos who is all like ""i am atriox im the new bad guy, now im going to disappear from the rest of the game because im not actually in this game at all."" and throws chief into space which magically freezes him for 6 months. chief wakes up and the big bad guy he fought 'died' apparently which then just gets retconned at the end. all the spartans that were with you have been reduced to setpieces, so you cant live the cool fantasy of chief leading in fellow spartans on a cool assault against the bad guys in a new fresh coat of not halo 5 paint. oh yeah, funny how our boy fernando withstood the same shit and was just a little sore for a few minutes. after a little bit of far cry spiderman gear rising revengance, you get thrown a new 343 fanfic trope, which is introducing a new bad guy, and they're called the e n d l e s s (wow) and they're fucking stupid because theyre just some aliens that withstood a halo blast and now suddenly the forerunners just dont like them because they're enabling the flood i guess. instead of that; they could have played it safe and just gave us the flood to fight again, and say we need to make sure a proto gravemind isnt made, and this thing happens again because we dont have the arbiter and the swords with us because they're stuck on sanghelios until we can deal with cortana or some plot reason until we can get some of the swords of sanghelios to help out on the ring. oh, and since we get nothing cool, mught as well get myself some special variant rockets, hand them to every marine possible, get myself a razorback, and let every rocket marine on, and just let the banished feel all the frustration i feel on what's been honestly missing from the whole game.

they held off on adding forge until it was a year and a half late. that really choked the life out of this game. they also made the forge ui just as complicated as halo 5's forge, which without the prefab structure setpieces, are absolutely useless to me. some of those prefab structures in halo reach and h2a forge were pretty integral in map making, but it also offered familiarity to where people could create interesting ideas. cant build a cool spaceship no more.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,23.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual",76561198923914139,"Marvel's Spider Man was amazing, the game is heavily inspired by Batman Arkham and i feel that, however, having an original new Spider Man game again with such a high level of quality was such an amazing thing for me man, i love spider man, he's one of my favorite heroes and i've read a lot of HQs of him

Now, going for the game, Story is excellent, it has some not so good moments but it's common for a game with this amount of hours, story is about 20 hours, the DLCs felt boring in the majority of the time, however atleast it's a DLC with new story, so even though i got bored in the middle, it was good

Gameplay is essentially Batman Arkham, it's great and feels smooth, web swinging is amazing and fun, had a lot of fun seeing the villains in the game and seeing the development of the story, even though at some point it started to get a bit rushed, that's something i didn't find that bad because at the start there was just nothing happening at all lol

Now for some flaws, i think the game should have had a bit more of a variety in boss fights styles, i liked them, but they're all literally do webs at boss > dash and hit him > webs at boss > dash and hit him, with the amount of gadgets the game gives you, i expected more of them to be used, it was still cool tho, boss fights aren't the main point in this game but yeah alright

Also, i feel like this game shouldn't have had some of the stealth parts, or they could have just gone better, they were actually enjoyable but it was an awkward sudden change in the gameplay

Well, the game is amazingly fun, i liked it a lot, nice game, i'd recommend it for anyone

I also had some weird performance issues and bugs, at times.

Otherwise, this is surprisingly a very good game, and the end of the story allowed me to now somewhat like the character of Spider-Man (the final fight was also just very graphically beautiful, even if not very in-depth, engaging, or difficult).",True,0,0,1764138273,N/A,Steam

Here and there you can literally spot graffiti of a pyramid with an eye - which symbolises the corrupt elite that control society through manipulation and crime. This ties with the following points.

The story with Otto Octavius and Mayor Osborne seems to suggest and follow the narrative that corrupt business men get away with stealing credit and reap the rewards from the real innovators and people who want to make a positive influence in the world. This reminded me of other real world cases such as Nikola Tesla and Martin Fleischmann.

Before becoming Dr. Octopus, Otto is at risk of personality changes/ psychosis? when plugging in to the 4 armed machine to ensue vengeance against Osbourne which implies that anyone that feels motives to target a corrupt person in power suffers from mental illness. This nonsense can be seen in numerous real life cases such as Luigi Mangione and Charlie Manson.
To me, the game subtly hints at the idea that the powerful stay on top and people who raid their ivory tower are silenced and your job as Spiderman is to enforce that. Peter's motives at the end of the game are questionable and the game gives you no choice in the matter.

Hollow Knight takes you through the difficulty curve pretty well and for me it was an amazing challenge. I've played Cuphead before coming into this and the Early Game was easy comparatively. The late game bosses especially the DLC comprising of Grim Troupe & Godhome was an exceptional challenge which I was looking for.

There is a huge story behind the game and it's interesting, engaging and spikes your curiosity. The art style is beautiful and the music (BGMs & OST) is amazing given the scenario at hand, There are many areas to explore which is amazing but can lead to finding specific stuff being a tedious chore (But you have plenty of guides online if you aren't into finding them yourself).

Overall the game is not for the faint hearted if you aren't used to dying a lot for the late game optional challenges (but that's what makes it fun!) but the base game is well rounded for most people. I'd recommend this to everyone who wants a challenge and an amazing story/lore unravelled about the world our little Knight treads in.",True,0,0,1764185962,N/A,Steam

In most metroidvanias you feel powerful while remaining vulnerable and this game you just lose for the sake of losing. 

For how difficult the bosses are (<- that's good) benches are extremely far away (<-that's bad) you lose half your HP before you even reach them. And you can't even practice them in anyway before that. Half of the journey is travelling to the boss rooms.

The nail arts are so inapplicable in an actual combat scenario it's basically just there for show. You can hit them once per hard fight if your pre-prep it before you get there and that's.. that's it...

Backtracking is INSANE, and the fast travel is *extremely* limited. It is also extremely unclear where you should go in this game, one wrong step and poof enemies just delete you or you're in a boss room without even knowing. It reminds me of the SNES times where you needed a booklet with a guide to backseat you the entire game.

I like this game's exploration a lot.
Metroidvania aspect is just amazing. It's super funny to open new ways, secrets, abilities, etc.
But many gameplay aspects is created just to hurt you.
There's no reason for bosses to have so much health. Yeah, that's cool to solve boss. To understand it's moves, it's abilities. And be able to counteract it. But if you need to repeat this counteractions for about 5-10 minutes for a try - that's not funny, just frustrating. And especially if you need to run 5-10 minutes more from bench to boss.
Benches near hard episodes and less bosses' health and this game would be great.

Hollow Knight,367520,14.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198136341817,"I really wanted to like this game, but this is probably the most overglazed and overhyped game of all time. It is regularly called the ""Souls-like Metroidvania,"" but a better comparison would be to call it the Fortnite of Metroidvanias becuase it's not really that deep, but appeals to mainstream gamers who aren't really that deep into the Metroidvania genre, or gaming as a whole. And don't get me wrong, this game is fun at times, but it excels at nothing and is rather bland as a whole. If you are looking for a visually striking, creative and innovative Metroidvania with challenging or even souls-like combat, play Blasphemous or Symphony of the Night instead. This game is not that, contrary to what others say.

As a Metroidvania, it is probably the most shallow and uninteresting Metroidvania I have ever played. The level design is extremely repetitive and bland, The exploration appears open yet lacks any vision and ends up being largely linear and involves you often walking in circles until you find a hidden door you missed. There is very little movement growth, really only getting a dash, wall jump and double jump. Back tracking is not rewarding because by the time you get anything out of it you've already run through the same area 10 times already. The environments also lack visual clarity and often look more or less the same screen from screen. While some Metroidvania's make more use of the map than others, A large portion of this game's upgrades are just adding rudimentary features to the map like showing your cursor on the map or marking merchants on it. This really isn't much of a Metroidvania as much as it is a walking simulator because the movement is so slow and you spend so much time trudging through the same areas over and over.

As a Souls-like, the Combat is extremely shallow and a complete letdown. Combat in it's entirety really just boils down to just mashing a single button and has virtually zero depth. Parry timing is extremely tight and while it does nullify a single instance of damage, it's ultimately better just to button mash and deal damage than it is to strategically bait out a parry. Dodging provides zero Iframes and is purely a traversal tool here, further limiting combat to this passive game of chicken where you run in, mash, run away, repeat. Even among Metroidvanias, which to be frank, usually have lackluster Combat: Hollow Knight stands out as exceptionally repetitive and bland in virtually every aspect. The only reason this game gets called a souls-like is because it has corpse running (IE: Death = you must recover your body or all your currency is lost) and because it has a parry button. Controls are sluggish and the opposite of tight. Frankly, calling it a Souls-like is an insult to Soulslikes.

The Art style and Lore seems to carry this game in the eyes of many, but to be honest, that is also rather basic and shallow. Character sprites are minimalistic, bland and even when they are distinct from one another, there isn't much interest to them. The NPC's also have virtually zero dimension to them, so there's not really any reason to be invested in them or their (non-existent) stories. Assets and Backgrounds don't really match in terms of style or level of detail. Characters have thick, blocky lines and no shading or detail whatsoever, while backgrounds are highly detailed, shaded and static.

If I didn't get this game for under $5, I would probably really disappointed. It's not a terrible game, but there are flash games of equal or superior quality from like 2008 both graphically and mechanically.",False,3,2,1763705196,N/A,Steam

Most reviews I see talk about this. You reach the first really tough boss, end up losing over and over again and are reset to a checkpoint that is miles away to walk all the way back and try again.

This is a souls like game that instead of offering you retries, punishes you for dying. Oh you lost? Now walk all the way back from beginning. Also you lose all your upgrades until you reach the point where you last lost. Then HOPE you don't die again to waste more time traveling back to the fight AGAIN.

Half if not most of the game is running around trying to figure out what you're supposed to do, I don't find that fun. I would have preferred to have directions or a hint on where to go or something.
Yes exploring is fun, but not when you spend most of your time going over the areas you've already been, running around trying to find what the next objective is. Imagine GTA V but without mission markers. It gets boring and annoying having to google everything.

Later on you can buy markers to put on your map. Great! just mark where I've already been or where I want to come back, right? NOPE, you get a max of 6 markers (for each color) for whatever reason.

Ok I'll just remember where I've been, right? Well, what happens when I don't play for a few weeks then come back? already forgot everything.

Then during boss fights, or I guess in general, if you die, instead of respawning nearby, you respawn at the last bench you saved at. It's not fun and frustrating dying and then having to walk all the way back while taking damage along the way.

Then there's also the fact that, for whatever fucking reason, in order to see where you are on the map you need to sacrifice a slot which could be used for other upgrades. Same thing for automatically picking up dropped coins from monsters, like why aren't they just permanent upgrades?

Pros of Hollow Knight I loved the early/mid game and how mysterious the game feels to some one who has never played the game before and the nail combat plus the movement felt real nice to play with, and the challenge of the game did not feel bad at all to me I sure felt it with some bosses and areas but it never felt impossible. Cons of Hollow Knight I want to start this part if the review by saying I did beat the game and got skill but that aside I still feel like I want to point the cons of the game that I have with it. Con one for me will be the art style of the game I am not calling the art bad it just did not pop to me, con two the late game in a whole I did not like the late game of Hollow Knight and for me the late game of Hollow Knight to be after you have done all dreamers and for me I also explored the whole map and picked a fight with every boss I found but I still did not feel good fighting some of these bosses such as White-Defender, Lost Kin, and all dream bosses as a whole accept for Nightmare King Grimm witch to me is the best boss in the whole game and the best boss that team charry has ever made.

Hollow Knight,367520,14.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198835281964,"Came back to leave a review after completing Silksong. I found Hollow Knight really hard to stick with and dropped it multiple times before finally finishing it prior to playing Silksong. 

My biggest complaint is that the storytelling is super vague and expects the player to pick up a big chunk of even the main storyline from environmental clues that aren't necessarily easy to make sense of. I can see how this method of storytelling appeals to people, but it's definitely not my cup of tea, and I struggled to maintain interest. I powered through the game and even after getting the ""true"" ending, still felt like I didn't really understand what is going on at all until I watched a video explaining everything which, looking back, I would never have been able to pick up myself.

Storytelling aside, the combat felt really one-dimensional. Having played Nine Sols before and Silksong after, I can't help but find Hollow Knight's combat system and boss fights lacking and boring, mostly relying on positioning and avoiding enemy attacks with a jump and a simple dash. While I understand that HK's combat is designed and balanced around enemies inflicting touch damage, I'm not a big fan of it, and found that bosses who rely on killing the player with them accidentally running into it are generally just less fun than bosses with more complex skill/movesets. And while Silksong has the same exact system, the combat just feels more fun and rewarding because of how fluid Hornet moves, and the addition of some movement abilities, with the biggest gamechanger being Clawline as a gap-closer or a way to deal with aerial enemies. I understand that Nine Sols has a completely different combat system and it's not fair to compare the combat of the two, but Nine Sols' parry-focused combat is perfect and just feels way way more rewarding than HK's and if you haven't played Nine Sols you should!

A solid game, albeit not perfect.

The game world and its backstory are well crafted, beautiful, and immersive.
The creature design is bad ass, and so are some of the characters. Others a bit less.

The game inserts a LOT of filler and repeated content though to artificially increase duration. I can't stomach these endless hunting challenges. The shop, crafting and inventory management systems are tedious, but at least the weapon variety is good.

Aloy? Don’t make me fucking laugh. She’s a bland-ass, cardboard ‘chosen one’ with zero depth, zero growth, and zero soul. The writers shoved her down our throats like she was some iconic badass, but in reality, she’s flat, forced, and fake as fuck. Stack her up against a real protagonist like Arthur Morgan from RDR2, and Aloy looks like a pathetic piece of shit cosplay.

And the gameplay? Christ, it’s the same repetitive ass cycle on loop: scan, shoot, tear off parts, repeat. That’s it. Over and over and over again. The robot dinosaur concept sounds badass, but when every fight boils down to the same formula, it turns into a fucking chore. The side quests are even worse, uninspired, fetch-quest garbage that only pad the playtime.

Revisiting it on PC after buying it on a deep sale... it's aged very poorly.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Graphics are really good imo, even for a game this age, even though it was a console exclusive. The art style has held up and looks good. Lighting is good, shadows are good, textures are good.

[*] Combat is... serviceable. You never feel ""strong"", but with good aim you can cripple machines and make them into glorified robot vacuum cleaners with anger issues.

[*] Decent array of weapons and armour options, with decent customisation (non-visual though... never got why that's a thing, kinda sucks imo).
[/list] 

And that's basically it for the Pros.

Cons:
[list]
[*] Aloy's face is squarer than some of my Minecraft skins, truly. If you want cute female (and male) protagonists, look East, cuz the West ain't gonna deliver. Thank you mod makers for saving the day (again).

[*] Outfits are decent, but apart from the Nora Brave they're kinda meh. They try to make Aloy look tough and competent, but never deliver. They sure as heck don't make her look any better, that's for sure. Thank you mod makers for saving the day (again again).

[*] Writing ranges from ""meh"" to ""alright, stop, ffs"". Aloy is bratty and wooden. Other characters are equally so. Very little emotion. Some quests are alright, other quests are boring garbage. Game's also back-loaded with lore, it's super tiring and it hits you like a truck filled with encyclopedias driven by a drugged-up librarian screaming ""LORE! HISTORY! REVELATIONS! PLOOOOT TWIIIIIST!"". My god, learn to pace this stuff!

[*] Animations and cut-scenes are... bad. Really, really bad. Jank everywhere. You can see this in one of the intro cut-scenes as the Proving aspirants light their floaty lanterns, after they're lit, at least 8 NPCs do a synchronised ""get up and look around"" animation. Other NPCs nearby clap in perfect sync, no emotion or lower-body movement to be had.
Additionally, all NPCs suffer from ""wave my stiff hands around like a lunatic mannequin"" syndrome. It's both hilarious and bad. You'd think they'd put a bit more effort but nah.

[*] Game suffers from problems rampant in that era, such as ""climb ONLY this clearly, colourfully marked stuff"" and ""badass chick with a bow vs. the world"" (but she's Lara Croft from Temu lol) and ""there's collectables, here's a map with all of them clearly marked"" and ""there are puzzles, but the protagonist will spell out the solution to each puzzle in <10sec of you seeing the puzzle, sometimes even before you get to see it"".

[*] Game also suffers from ""here's a bunch of loot but 90% of it is filler and garbage lmao, fill those bags!"". Seriously, you do a quest and all you get are sticks, 4 traps, 1 health pot and some metal scrap. What the sh*t?
You collect the clearly marked collectables, turn them in for a prize, and you get extremely underwhelming boxes of basic materials you can also farm in about 5min. Absolutely abysmal loot system.

[*] You'd think they'd make this game's controls respect the fact it's now on PC... they really didn't.
Listen, bozos, I got a keyboard with 104 freakin keys. A controller has like 14. LET ME USE MORE KEYS. I've counted them, and without moving my left hand, I have 28 available keys (no SHIFT modifiers needed) to press. Not counting Caps Lock or Win key, not counting F1-F5.

Why do I have to awkwardly press Z and X to cycle through consumables??? Why not, here's a genius idea, let me map some of those to my 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 keys? Why not G? Why not T, R, B, H, Y, N or ~? Why do you only let me use Q, Z, X, C, V, W, A, S, D, F, CTRL and SHIFT?

No, I'm not counting M for Map, or J for Quests, or K for skills, as those affect gameplay as much as a wet rag on a pigeon. I'm counting the complete lack of buttons that made me have a gaming PC in the first place.
[/list]

I'll stop here. I will get all the achievs in the game just because I have it and I wanna see the 100% on the steam page, but that's really the only reason I'm playing.
I'm sure the game was a hit when it came out, but it feels like a very Sony cookie-cutter 3rd person action adventure game with very, very shallow systems (apart from combat, which as I said is decent).

in my opinion the only thing that was consistently positive in this game is the environment and the mechs. it is extremely pretty, even though sometimes it's blinding cos you can't turn off lens flare. and the mechs are sick as hell.

- story seems interesting in the first few hours, and nothing actually happened during that and then at the last 10 hours they loredump heavily
- combat is a little dogshit, the enemy has an invincibility window a couple of seconds after you crit them, so you never actually feel powerful even with all the upgrades you get. and the enemies just get tankier and tankier as the game progresses
- most dialogue is trash, and aloy isn't a very easily likeable character. i think this was made during the marvel era sassy dialogue so she's consistently negative about almost everything.

~Great things about this game~
Awesome concept and world.
Great soundtrack and ambiance. 
Great to test GPU performance.

~Bad things~
Exploration is on the threshold of between fluid and clunky. Really 'bumpy'. 
Gameplay is not engaging comparative to other action games (e,g Days Gone, Far Cry).
Dialog is so monotonous, I'm watching my phone most of the time.  
Story was engaging at first but the dialog made it worse as the story goes on and it stagnates. 
The animation and characters are stiff most of the time except on key cutscenes. 
The people of the world doesn't feel ""alive"". Many free to play games feel more ""alive"" than this game.

I was willing to push through Day's Gone and wanted to do the same for Horizon. To my surprise, I think Day's Gone is far better than Horizon. For now, I think I'm going to play more Day's Gone. LMAO. Solid 5 out of 10.

Horizon Zero Dawn,1151640,0.0,12,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198039336885,"ok so i’ve tried to get into Horizon: Zero Dawn like 3 different times now and after dumping 21 hours into it i just can’t do it anymore, every time i encountered the same exact wall. i feel like it’s time wasted but at least ain’t nobody gonna tell me now that i didn’t give it a fair run with a straight face, i finished probably a bit over half of the game before i decided to let it go. i think i gotta accept that i’m done with this game for good.

the annoying thing is i really want to like it. the whole mystery of “where did the machines come from” and “what happened to the world” is actually fascinating to me. but the act of playing this thing is just so mind-numbingly boring. exploration is literally the same checklist open world garbage i’ve seen in a million other games: cluttered map, repetitive activities, boring side quests. combat is fun, cauldrons are fun, sure. but everything around those moments is just pure boredom. and around the 10 hour mark you’ve already seen every challenge the game has to offer, so then you’re just repeating the same set of challenges over and over again. i was actually pounding caffeinated drinks just so i wouldn’t fall asleep mid-game. not even kidding.

dialogue is another huge problem. i don’t usually mind games with tons of talking. some games make dialogue one of the best parts. but here it’s just so bland. like, 80% of the conversations don’t hold my interest at all. but if you skip them, you immediately feel like you’re missing key story beats. so you either slog through it half-asleep or skip it and get confused. people kept telling me “don’t worry, the game gets good once you reach X” but once i got way past that point, i still didn't feel it.

and i know i’m in the minority here. tons of people LOVE this game. i see how fans obsess over the lore and the characters and just soak it all in. and i get it, it clicks with a lot of people. but to me the lore itself is boring. not just the dialogue, not just the quests, but the actual worldbuilding is boring. the mystery of the machines is cool, but the tribes, the politics, the everyday struggles of the people in this world… none of it grabbed me. it all just feels like post-apocalypse boilerplate with a tribal paint job. i never cared about which settlement was fighting which, who was struggling, or why i should be invested in all these little conflicts. so if the world is supposed to be the main selling point, and that doesn’t hit, then there’s nothing left for me to latch onto.

so yeah, 21 hours in and i’m done. Horizon: Zero Dawn clearly has its fans and i respect that, but i can’t recommend it if you:

- get bored easily with repetitive open world checklist stuff

- need dialogue to be sharp and interesting to stay awake

- don’t care about tribal/political worldbuilding

if you’re the kind of player who loves digging through every codex entry, listening to tons of lore dumps, and doesn’t mind repetitive side content as long as the world hooks you, then yeah you’ll probably love it. wish i could say the same, but nah, i’m out.",False,5,0,1756118059,N/A,Steam

Sometimes I feel like they just create a map and then randomly throw in generic collectibles and side quests to make it feel alive, thus failing miserably. Side quests are extremely boring and repetitive, and the optional objectives are an absolute waste of time. After a good amount of hours doing open-world stuff, I just got annoyed at the game and ended up rushing the story because I was just fed up with the world as a whole.

Horizon Zero Dawn,1151640,0.0,12,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198061282682,"I won't recommend Horizon Zero Dawn because I didn't really like it, but I don't think it's a bad game in itself. Let's start with the positives. The game is very very good looking visually. You can stop and look at the view pretty much anytime and be like : waw that's beautiful. The combat against the robots are also very good because they aren't just an HP bar : you can break things, make some components explode, and even use their own weapons against them. This kind of interaction is very cool and well thought, making the combats feel less repetitive . The musics are also really great and I enjoyed the setting of the game. Some characters are also pretty nicely done even if it's not the case for every single one of them. 

Now, it seems great but, what did I dislike ? First of all, the game is beautiful but there is very little rewards for exploration. Yes of course you'll find components here and there, but it's far from what I've saw in other open world games like Elden Ring which was the last one I played. And I truly think it's a shame because you don't really get rewarded to explore such a beautiful world. My review is mostly subjective but I think this particular criticism is objective, and one of the biggest complaints you can have while playing Horizon Zero Dawn. I usually like exploring everything, but I quickly found myself just going to point A to point B without exploring anything in order to follow the story. You can still do it at the end of the day I guess but, yeah not a whole lot of rewards for that. Talking about the story, maybe it's not commmon but even if Aloy is a good character, I didn't really liked the story that much. It's far from bad don't get me wrong but the plot of the game didn't manage to captivate my attention. I didn't finish the game so it might be better later on, but where I'm at it's not bad nor incredible and I dropped the game because I just didn't enjoy my time that much. But maybe it'll be an incredible story for you that's just my very own opinion on it. Following that, bugs. I didn't really crash, maybe once, but I had a few game breaking bugs that forced me to restart a mission, such as NPCs not reacting despite being needed for the quests, or me being stuck in terrains which happened a few times and was extremely annoying. I'm fine with bugs, but not when it ruins the experience and has any impact on your gameplay/playthrough. I also have a bug making a notification appear in my inventory even if I checked everything that I had. This notification is permanent,  I played hours with it, and it's really personal but I despise having unchecked notifications... but I can't remove it so yeah. On the fighting side, using melee doesn't feel great at all but you'll play the game 95% at range so it's not really a valid point to make. Lastly, the facial expressions in cutscenes are really poorly done, which unfortunately happens to be a reoccuring problem in gaming.

To sum up, no Horizon Zero Dawn is not a bad game in itself. I just found myself quickly losing interest because of everything that I mentionned above. Should you buy it/can you enjoy it ? Maybe, you'll enjoy it more than me yes. But I can't recommend a game I didn't really enjoy. At the end of the day, gaming is still subjective.",False,1,0,1754908081,N/A,Steam
Horizon Zero Dawn,1151640,0.0,12,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561197960717305,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a strange game to me - it has so much potential and it can be really hard to pin-point why I don't like it or want to play it. The gameplay isn't terrible, the graphics are obviously pretty decent and the concept behind the story is great. 

However, when all is said and done, I find the game non-engaging, the story too bland to care about and the protagonist stuck somewhere between unlikable and shallow. 

Horizon ZD is like playing a Young Adult novel in a way. It's the same sort of characters, a fairly bland protagonist that the reader/player can transpose their own traits unto, a dystopian world where teenagers are the only hope against a corrupted, lost society and pretty weak character arcs based on predestined properties like a prophecy or in this case, special genes that are humanity's only hope. 

And I guess that's what turns me off. I don't really care that much about anyone in the story, including Aloy herself, and then the game has to be carried by the mechanics and even though they're sort of fine, they never manage to rise above that. It's... fine. You'd think that hunting huge, robot dinosaurs would be epic and exciting but oddly it isn't. Maybe it's also because our protagonist doesn't really act like it is, I'm not sure. It's all so... indifferent. Fighting the dinos is more about solving a maths problems sometimes, even though the fights are or can be pretty difficult. I don't know. I guess the gameplay could be ok if the story or characters were engaging, but for me they aren't. Now this might be because I'm not a young adult, but this review are meant for other potential players who may also not be young adults and may not want to play through a story meant for them.

    GRAPHICS
    At first glance, the visuals seem impressive — environments, effects, and overall style look solid.
    But after a while, the plastic look of the characters becomes hard to ignore. Even main characters lack believable facial expressions. Scars look like someone sliced dough with a knife. On the surface, it’s fine — but look closer, and it feels cheap and rushed.

    DIALOGUES
    Flat, dull, and often silly. Emotional delivery feels like high school theater.
    Dialogue choices (fist, brain, heart) exist, but they only affect one or two lines of NPC response. After a few hours, you’ll probably start skipping everything but the last reply. Shallow and empty.

    STORY
    There’s no real intrigue — it plays out like a stitched-together collection of clichés.
    The game literally starts like The Lion King — the girl is held up before the tribe. Then, she runs off crying and “accidentally” falls into a giant underground facility… that she somehow never discovered despite living right next to it for years.
    The pacing is erratic: time jumps without context, followed by long, boring treks. Fast travel is available, but costs in-game resources — the game punishes you for trying to save time.
    Tribal logic is laughable: a girl clearly linked to their gods appears, and they exile her. It’s explained as “tradition,” but it’s clearly just lazy writing. There’s no depth to the religion, culture, or morality — everything exists just to push the story forward.

    COMBAT
    This is where the game shines. Fighting mechanical beasts is tactical, satisfying, and fun. Weaknesses, traps, and weapon choice actually matter. It’s the one truly fresh and well-executed part of the game.

    OVERALL
    Horizon Zero Dawn tries to present itself as a massive, ambitious project — but underneath it’s a shallow, derivative experience.
    The visual wow-effect and robot fights grab attention early, but after 4–6 hours the lack of depth becomes impossible to ignore. It feels like a stitched-together set of borrowed ideas: Ubisoft-style map structure, generic sci-fi setting, and cheap storytelling.

Metro Exodus is not just a game; it’s an emotional journey through a ruined world filled with danger, hope, and breathtaking moments. From the very beginning, it feels like you’re living inside a real story. The characters are incredibly well-written, and every choice you make feels meaningful.

The visuals are stunning. The open areas are rich with detail, each region having its own atmosphere—from frozen wastelands to dry deserts. The lighting and shadows are phenomenal, especially in dark tunnels or during sunsets over destroyed landscapes.

Gameplay is perfectly balanced:

Deep weapon customization

Limited resources that make every encounter intense

A smooth blend of stealth and action

Atmospheric music that enhances every scene

But the heart of the game is its story. It's emotional, human, and makes you feel truly connected to the crew of the Aurora. Even the quiet moments around the campfire are memorable and meaningful.

Metro Exodus masterfully combines open-world exploration, a dark and immersive atmosphere, emotional storytelling, and exceptional artistic detail. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic experiences you can have.",True,1,0,1763497225,N/A,Steam

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,76561198042445715,"Metro Exodus is easily the biggest and best game of the series; all the hard work and development 4A Games built up since 2010 culminates in an expansive and poignant adventure with just a few small stumbles along the way.

Some time after Metro Last Light, Artyom clings to the hope that a better life exists beyond the underground tunnels. By chance, him and his wife Anna discover a fully functioning train and a long-buried truth that has been hidden for decades. A long journey begins as Artyom, Anna, Colonel Miller and the rest of the Order set out to find a new home. The story is certainly the best yet with a genuinely likeable and charismatic group of characters. From a writing standpoint, Anna has been vastly improved from the last entry and there is a greater sense of hope that compels you onward.

But the developer didn't stop there; they drastically expanded the scale and scope of the levels, taking some inspiration from Metal Gear Solid 5 and other open-world titles. The Volga River and Caspian Desert chapters are both brilliant showcases of building landscapes that feel real. There are no tickbox objectives, tedious busywork or pointless collectables. Everything has been hand-crafted from bandit camps to the main missions. It all blends so well with the franchise's deep immersion and completionists will gladly explore every nook and cranny.

The gameplay remains as visceral and engaging as ever with a few important tweaks. The bullet economy is gone, replaced by a handy crafting system. With tons of different weapons, attachments, repairs and upgrades, you have more free rein over your chosen armaments. The stealthy approach is also much more viable with the day/night cycle feeding right into your infiltration. There's a good balance between humans and monsters in combat and the title still packs plenty of tension with Artyom's fragile health pool.

It has some issues here and there, namely some ocassionally clunky movement and a lacklustre boss fight or two, but Metro Exodus is a must-own for all fans of shooters, horror and atmospheric immersion. There's no doubt that 4A are at the top of their game and I'm looking forward to what they put out next.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,76561198831023847,"[h1] Metro Exodus: A Metro game that doesn't belong [/h1]
[h2] Intro [/h2]
I am a long time fan of the entire Metro franchise, playing all the games it has to offer and reading plenty of the books as well. As a long time fan, I need to say that this game doesn't feel like Metro at all, it doesn't have that same vibe that the original metro or metro last light games had.

The game itself can be very clunky at times, especially with vehicles and the bunch of glitches they have. There are soft-lock issues, movement glitches and generally just bad level design at times.

[h2] Game Design [/h2]
The game design itself is very lacking, and to me, pretty disappointing. The partial open world levels get very stale, very quick. Every level is the same, you get some more of the story, you get random quests and need to roam the map often repeating similar actions etc. It is just not very interesting and it is very, very repetitive.

[h2] Morale [/h2]
The morale system is very bad, I went on every ""side quest"" that was morale related, like bringing back a guitar or teddy bear etc. expecting that it would be enough for a good ending, but I was SHOCKED when I finished the game and got one of the worse endings. Ends up, you need to use this games awful stealth mechanics at any time you can in order to get the good ending, which is quite absurd, considering you aren't exactly going around and killing a bunch of good people.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
All in all, I can see how some people might enjoy this game, especially those that aren't necessarily long time Metro fans, but to me this game is disappointing and I cannot recommend it. For a Metro game, it should either be full open world or fully linear like usual, a semi open world level game is too hard to pull off good with a universe such as Metro.",False,3,0,1760475044,N/A,Steam
Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,76561198285572315,"The game is a plain ok for me, followed by a couple of technical problems with it. First of all, it runs on a separate window instead of through Steam which results in various crashes, when alt+tabbing for example. Secondly, I couldn't roam the Caspian level because the vehicle was stuck between desert particles; I was unable to move it and roamed through the level on foot. 

Story-wise, there were a few enganging moments but nothing too serious nor it had the crisp of the other two installments in the franchise. Side-stories, additionally, felt too detached and quite ""empty"". Combat is mediocre with some erratic movements from the enemies. Point-blank range can fail and for long-range there were no distinct physics that would result in avoiding the target (or maybe I couldn't identify them)

The reason I uninstalled, and thankfully I played Two Colonels DLC first, is the autosaves that did not happen for half an hour in the Sam's Story DLC. That resulted in a huge loss of progress. However, that issue was not present in the main game and the flow was fine,

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,29.99,0,solo,Action,76561197969925697,"As much as I want to give this game a positive review, I just can't due to a few big issues. Keep in mind that I played on Ranger mode which I have also done so in previous Metro games.

Positives:

-The graphics are decent and the game doesn't rely on upscaling to run well.
-Animations are great (meaty shooting sounds and satisfying reloading etc).
-SFX is mostly great.
-The game's world/setting is enjoyable.
-I still really like the classic Metro ideas of having to charge your flashlight / pressure gun pumping mechanic and the mask oxygen filters. Simple but makes the general gameplay loop more satisfying (and it isn't really possible to run out of oxygen in this game unlike previous Metro games as you are able to craft them).


Negatives:

-AI - This is the biggest and most glaring issue at least when playing on Ranger mode. The AI has 2 different difficulties they will switch between... 1) Being completely braindead and easily manipulated... to... 2) Having godlike aim and will insta 1 pop your head the millisecond you enter their sight AT ANY RANGE. Now you might be thinking ""OK well just go around and flank them then, it is an open world game!"", sure for general exploration... but there are several story focused missions where you are forced to walk down a linear pathway and the enemies are just waiting for you or you have just a couple of seconds to shoot them before they get into position and insta aimbot you. You often die in 1 hit on Ranger mode and rarely 2 hits. Some of these scripted fight areas completely ruin the game on Ranger mode as you will be reloading the game several times in order to try and kill many enemies in a row without a single mistake. It turns these scripted fights from an apparent challenge to a memory game of ""oh yeah, this bot will spawn here after I've killed these other ones"". A couple of these sections are just so ridiculous that I wonder if anyone on their team even tested how outrageous the 1 shot AIs are. In the very first mission they have an enemy behind a smoke cloud that you can't see through, but the bot can sure see you. Fun.

I quit the game at the crane in the desert area. Why? Because I get to the top and a scripted enemy attack happens from the bottom of the crane from the other side of the huge bridge that you have just came from. My first thought is to hide behind the cover and look through a gap that is *literally* just a couple of pixels wide. ""No way they can shoot me through this wall when they're about 200m away, surely?"". Yes, they can. These bandits did a perfect 1 shot on me over 200m away, through a tiny pixel gap on metal cover with their scrap shotguns and pistols. Why bother continue to play after that. When the bots have this scripted attack mode on you are completely screwed. The general world exploration you are able to stealth kill a lot of them and even if you pull aggro you can hide in stealth areas, distract them away etc which gives a lot of options to deal with them... but you have none of that in these scripted action sequences, you just have to shoot them before they can get in position to aim.

-The setting of the game is great but the dialogue and general storytelling is generic and boring. I'm not a story skipper in games but I sure wanted to skip past a lot of this dialogue. I never got that with the previous Metro games though. I played with English voice acting and that is also pretty bad (yeah I know I probably should have played with Russian). The enemies in particular are often very goofy and stupid.

-The open world is boring. Perhaps I have too high expectations as I've played many other open world games with two examples being Xenoblade and Genshin but the open world in this game is pretty bad. There is barely anything to do and exploration is actively not encouraged as you are often just wasting bullets on monsters just to get less bullets back as your exploration ""reward"". I get that it is an apocalypse so you can't be having a dopamine spree with opening loot every minute but still... Why bother with an open world game if you put such little content in it. Feels like they just wanted another linear game but slightly different just for a change of pace.


TL;DR. The shooting is fun and satisfying (I love the bolt action stealth pistol especially) but you are either just shooting target dummies or getting 1 shot from any range INSTANTLY on Ranger mode in sections where stealth is scripted to not be possible. The open world and the dialogues are boring. The game is likely a lot more fun on non-Ranger modes but I honestly cannot be bothered to continue, unfortunately.",False,0,0,1759869856,N/A,Steam

I didn't have the time to start giving a crap about them. Good example of the story being so fast is Stepan and Katya. It feels from my perspective like they just met and suddenly they are married! Like what?!  When?! Why?! The game feels soo short.  The things I liked were customization for guns and gun play. It has that feeling it had in 2033 and Last Light but made even better.

More often than not, my opponents either have way more hours under their belt (fair enough, I joined late - I have no issue with this) or they’ve bought their way into a completely stacked deck. And honestly? That’s fine. If someone wants to drop half their rent to lose to someone with a starter deck, I’m not going to stop them. To be fair, I [b]do[/b] get why the matchmaking works this way - it keeps queues fast and the player pool healthy. And yes, every card can technically be earned through play - it’ll just take a lot of hours and patience to get there. At the end of the day, it’s still not as fair a system as it could be, and whales do have a clear edge early on.

Aside from the unfair matchmaking in the previous regard, when I [b]am[/b] playing against people my own level or economic situation, it is an incredibly fun experience. It certainly feels rewarding to overcome your opponent with a supreme strategy, which are, most of the time, dynamically changing as the game goes on. This keeps me on the edge of my seat and has me constantly thinking ahead as to what the opponent might do and how I might react - it's great!

On another note, the graphics & animations are very pleasing, the variety of cards is impressive, and despite my earlier complaint about people essentially paying to win, you do indeed get a great amount of content and opportunities to build a formidable deck without spending any money. To date, I have won most of my games, and again, that's without spending a cent. Also, there is a draft game-mode where you and your opponent both build a deck from scratch by choosing from randomly presented card packages - which is a neat break in between things.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who falls into the following groups:
- You enjoyed playing Gwent in The Witcher 3
- You're a fan of strategy OR tabletop games and like to flex your strategic superiority
- You have some money to burn and enjoy having the upper hand on lower level players as a result
- Are a fan of The Witcher in general

So yeah, ultimately, it’s a very fun game - especially when a whale drops a small fortune on cards and still gets wiped by someone who spent $0. [i]At this point, they’re basically just paying to boost my ego, so who am I to complain?[/i]",True,1,0,1760843383,N/A,Steam

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198108285040," My Review of Gwent

When I sit down with Gwent, it doesn’t feel like a game meant to pass time or bait quick dopamine hits—it feels like stepping into a world that understands where I’m at in life. The Witcher universe has always carried weight, but Gwent translates that maturity into something more than flavor. The card art alone tells stories of hardship, struggle, and consequence. It’s not childish spectacle; it’s grit and realism wrapped in folklore, politics, and war.

What sets Gwent apart for me isn’t just the atmosphere, but the way it rewards patience, calculation, and composure. It doesn’t beg me to play flashy for the sake of it; it demands foresight, resource management, and the ability to read not just my hand, but my opponent’s mind. This resonates with my own approach to competition: I don’t play games to stumble into victories, I play to dissect, outthink, and sharpen myself through the process.

Unlike games that thrive on chaos or gimmicks, Gwent makes me feel like my victories carry meaning. Every round I win comes from strategy, timing, and restraint. Even in defeat, there’s value, because I can trace back exactly what I misread, what I wasted, or what I should have held onto longer. That kind of clarity isn’t common in games—and I appreciate it because it mirrors how I live: owning my mistakes, learning, and using them to rise stronger.

In short, Gwent doesn’t try to be for everyone, and that’s why it works for me. It’s a mature card game built for players who think deeply, who want to win with their mind rather than noise. It feels like a conversation with people closer to my age, not a playground of kids chasing thrills. And that makes every match, win or lose, feel like time well spent.

Just to preface this, I have probably 1k hours in the mobile and/or GOG version. This **WAS** one of my favorite games in the TCG genre. Until the devs cut support.

The core gameplay of this is very unlike other card games. You draw all of your cards at once (with addtl draws in between rounds) and take turns playing cards until you or your opponent pass. Games follow a best of three round system where typically only cards in-hand are retained between rounds (although there are some units with carryover effects). Cards don't have a mana value during a match, instead the ""mana"" value is accounted for during deckbuilding by forcing an upper limit of total mana across all cards in the deck. Cards are either units with point totals or are spells which impact other units's point totals in some way. Whoever has the most points on board at the end of a round wins that round. Decks building has 2 simple rules: the deck must have more than x number of cards and the deck must not go over a certain ""provision"" total (where each card has a provision amount which indicates the card's relative power).

Because of the Bo3 format, there are a lot of interesting strategies that come up. Do you go all in to win in round 1+2? Do you try to get your opponent to waste resources in round 1 and you go for the win in 2+3? Do you win big in round 1 then try to force an over-commitment from your opponent in round 2 so you have an advantage in round 3? There are lots of ways of think about strategy here. 

Unfortunately, the devs were too generous with players earning in-game currency, so the game didn't earn enough money. Due to this poor monetization structure, eventually CDPR cut support for the game and now there is no chance of there ever being new cards. Before they dropped support, they did implement a community voting system. This mixes up the meta every month, but the community tends to overreact to over- or under-performing cards, so it feels very chaotic. 

In the current state, I can no longer recommend this game, due completely to the fact that there will be no further support for the game.",False,3,0,1748713848,N/A,Steam

Gwent seemed like a fun little cardgame to play - with beautiful artwork and nice mechanics - so I decided to give it a try. The first impression was: ""You can't play the game, you must first sign up to this external log in."" After registering my mail, there was an error which prevented me from playing.
Being frustrated already, I restarted and logged in AGAIN, it finally worked. I then found out that you can't go all out in the first round because then you lose the other 2. So you have to play lame in order to win. There are many better card games out there that don't force you to play a certain way.

Lethal Company,1966720,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access",76561198199967009,"A well known survival loot game, this platform is able to deliver a multitude of fun for up to 4 players as they scramble around various maps to find 'scrap', avoid monsters, and sell them to the entity for profit. Despite being an indie game with laughably low graphics quality (think Minecraft), this platform is able to turn these disadvantages around by advertising itself as a VERY light-weight and rapid-loading game with minimal computer and temperature stresses. 

Up to 4 players are placed on particular 'moon' maps of one's choosing, and all have access to proximity voice and text chat. Clearly distinct and important items are brightly colored to contrast with the surrounding background, and more valuable loot are usually smaller or darker colored in nature. A variety of different monsters all require different strategies for management, adding to the tension, with some being able to more punish solo players than others. Tools become paramount in managing one's playthrough and can be picked up from dead players to prevent permanent loss. All of these aspects combine together as players eagerly or terrifyingly shout at their teammates for instructions or assistance as they strive to gather enough scrap and survive their moon maps. 

As mentioned earlier, graphics are ridiculously low quality, but it is clear that the game was deliberately designed as such. Still however, this may prove unattractive to some players who seek visual beauty and details. As players progress through more and more moons and scrap selling, they will eventually hit near impossible scrap goals, guarenteeing their inevitable game-over and restart, which may prove discouraging to some. Having a mic is almost a requirement, as most hosts often kick players who do not have any. The learning curve is quite sharp, as this game provides minimal hand holding and instead kicks their baby chick players out of the nest to die and learn anew. 

At the end of the day, this light-weight and computer friendly game provides an easy-to-pick up platformer with simple and straightforward goals. Even the most veteran players remain vulnerable to death, as the focus revolves not around combat, but survival and looting. Highly recommend with friends with mics, and for its relatively low price and computer stress, this game is a must-try for even the most casual players.",True,0,0,1764194923,N/A,Steam

Steam Review:  

Lethal Company stands out as one of the most unexpectedly amusing and genuinely thrilling co-op experiences I’ve encountered in quite some time. It strikes an ideal balance between horror and humor — one moment, you find yourself stealthily navigating a dimly lit corridor, listening for any signs of movement, and the next, you’re shrieking as your friend inadvertently opens the wrong door at the absolute worst moment. The game’s lo-fi visual style surprisingly enhances the eerie ambiance without detracting from the enjoyment. The diverse enemy types keep each mission engaging, while the sound design is exceptional; if you notice something breathing behind you, it’s probably too late. 

What truly sets this game apart is its player-driven chaos. Every session unfolds like a unique narrative: 

- There’s always that one person who gets overly ambitious for “just one more piece of scrap.” 
- Someone inevitably forgets to secure the bunker door. 
- And there’s always a player left behind during takeoff.

The replayability factor is immense, as even after numerous runs, I still find myself both laughing and feeling frantic simultaneously. If you enjoy cooperative gameplay, light survival elements, or shouting at friends while hurrying towards an extraction ship, this title is definitely worth purchasing. **10 out of 10  Would willingly sacrifice my coworker again.",True,0,0,1764132044,N/A,Steam

This game has brought me many hours of fun and enjoyment with my friends. However, I can’t turn a blind eye to the current state of things. The game, as it stands right now, is very lacking—no significant updates, extremely basic “changes,” and a complete lack of effort to keep players engaged. Sadly, it seems to be heading down the same path as many other indie games. What I mean by that is it appears to be stuck in Early Access hell forever.

It wouldn’t really be an issue if the game were free-to-play or sold as a complete product. My biggest gripe with all of this is that this is no longer a small project. The game has sold well and even had a collaboration with Epic Games. The means were there to continue developing the project and not leave players in the dark for so long. However, the predictable choice was to almost fully abandon the game and focus on other things while the game you paid for rots in Early Access limbo.

It's a coding nightmare with frustrating bugs at every corner and seemingly no desire to patch them from the lonesome creator. In fact, there's a whole remap button feature that just straight up does not work (my last straw), you input the new buttons and confirm the changes - just for the buttons to work just as before and for the game to forget even that you tried to change the controls at all as soon as you restart.

If you want to play a fun, well moderated, multiplayer, horror looter - play REPO which has been getting better and cleaner with every update.

Not this, a game that pulls in thousands of dollars just to receive the occasional bloat of nonsense mechanics and one off creatures instead of anything to fix or even fundamentally improve the game.

The mechs are really fun, and the game is gorgeous, but the writing and fact they can make a character loved, pitied, or hated solely via nothing but comms chatter - that is the truly great thing about ac6. 

To put it simply - the characters in this game feel like actual people, that could actually exist, 
It has one of the most genuinely hateable antagonists ive seen in a game, a cowardly, selfish, arrogant man without a good bone in his body, but somehow, he isnt boring, or annoying, or over the top.

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198101697564,"Armored Core: Fires of Rubicon – Review 8

Armored Core: Fires of Rubicon feels like a time capsule from the golden age of gaming—a reminder of when titles were tough, gameplay-first, and unburdened by fluff. Its lineage goes all the way back to the late ’90s PSX era, and that heritage shows: this is a game that knows exactly what it wants to be, and it delivers with confidence.

Visually, the game isn’t a powerhouse. Graphics: 8 —nothing spectacular, but clean, stylish, and perfectly functional for the speed and clarity a mech game demands. The real star is the combat. Gameplay: 8.5 —high-paced armored-mecha action at its finest. Like the classic entries, it expects you to adjust your build for each encounter rather than brute-force with pure skill, and that philosophy is still part of its charm.

The presentation hits solid notes across the board: Sound: 8, with industrial beats and sharp effects that fit the world, and Story: 7.5, a simple but compelling narrative that does more with restraint than many modern blockbusters do with endless cutscenes.

If you’re tired of bloated open worlds and checklist design, Fires of Rubicon is a breath of fresh air. It’s focused, challenging, stylish—and the kind of game that can make you fall in love with the medium all over again.",True,0,0,1763850189,N/A,Steam

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198842311643,"Honestly, I really liked this game, but after further play I realize I can't really recommend it. After going back and playing through other Armored Core games as well as other giant robot games both retro and modern, the fact that this is the game that is now the flag ship of the mecha genre is disappointing. Not because its worse than any of the other Armored Core games nor any other mecha game, but its disappointing that this is the best the genre has to offer. This is very easily one of the best if not the best Armored Core game out there. The game is extremely well polished, worked perfect on launch, and has no micro transactions or any major hickups, and the game can be extremely fun.
However, I just don't think this modernization of Armored Core works well. The Armored Cores of the past admittedly are not great. Many missions are just you destroying waves of clueless MT's that have no chance of beating you, until you come to a mission where you get absolutely destroyed by fighting 3 AC's at once. This game is far better than the Armored Cores of the past (don't take armored core fans word for it, actually go and play them and see for yourself if you don't believe me). But AC6 doesn't know what it wants to be. A big part of the Armored Cores of the past was that there was no healing. All the health you had was given at the start of the mission, this would turn certain missions into a game of learning how to navigate to the end while taking as little damage as possible for the boss. It also made your mechs feel more unique and specialized making you choose between just beefing up, or trying to be nimble and skilled enough to just avoid the damage all together. With the healing items and resupply mechanic in AC6, navigating through the map feels extremely trivial, almost like a waste of time. The combat is flashy and satisfying enough to where, on your first playthrough, you wont even notice how little they put up a fight. If somehow you manage to get through all your medkits fighting MT's, it doesn't even matter since you will autosave before you get to whatever boss you are going to fight. This mechanic in a weird way makes the game more frustrating, because if your build isn't cutting it for the boss, since you are mid mission you can't buy and sell parts to fit the job. So instead of just having the mission be the boss, you have to quit the mission, make your new mech, go fight your way back to the checkpoint, and then try your new build against the boss. This disincentivizes experimentation because the dark souls mentality (lets be honest that's why we ALL played this game) just tells you to keep fighting rather than back out, which while this can be satisfying, isn't what the Armored Core series has been about.
Speaking of the buy and sell system, while in the beginning this does lead to an interesting 4th dimension to mech building where you have to factor in the cost of parts, at a certain point in the game no matter what mech you want to build, if you just sell everything you can always make it (you get all your money back when selling parts). This just adds more friction to mech building requiring you to back out of the buy menu, go to the sell menu, sell all the parts you aren't currently using, then buy the ones you do. Even worse if it's a core in which you need to first buy the core you want, then swap, then sell. 
There are some really awesome missions in this game, but the majority of them just feel like the equivalent of orange waypoint AAA slop, just something to do because you have to do something. You don't really feel like the legendary Raven pilot, you feel like a fly swatter.
Like other AC games, you aren't necessarily getting attached to characters the same you would in a Baldurs Gate or a Tale Tale game or something. You just like them cause they are cool but nothing really beyond that. The ending quality varies WILDLY. The first ending I got absolutely blew me away and made me think about the game for weeks after I beat it, but after getting another ending, the ending most people probably would have gotten, I was extremely disappointed and felt completely unfulfilled after having going through the entire game again, which leads me to my last point.
This game isn't very replayable, but it very much tries to be. The mission replay system encourages you to replay missions to try and ""S-Rank"" them by beating them faster, taking less damage, ect, but doesn't present itself in a way that makes that satisfying. Maybe if there was an extra UI showing the time needed to S or the damage you can still take before going past the threshold while you are doing the mission it would feel better but you get nothing, once you are in the mission you are in the dark so it just feels unsatisfying. And most missions aren't interesting enough for you to even want to replay them, and you have to if you want to get all the endings, one of which requires you to get all other endings. 
But there still is a reason I have so much time in the game, and was my favorite game of 2023. The environments are beautiful and dreary. The sound design, particle effects, movement, and mech design are incredibly immersive and really give off this awesome feeling of dealing with truly extraordinary weapons and armor of the future. The aesthetic is raw and incredibly unique. The voice acting is, okay well the voice acting is really rough, but some characters like Handler Walter, Carla, Ayre, and Rusty, while not being fleshed out or honestly even really characters, are still presented in such a way that make them unforgettable (in certain endings). Where this game shines is what all AC games shine in, the customization, and this game turns it up to 11, letting you choose what type of weathering you want, how much weathering, differing finishes between matte and glossy, colors, your boosters, targeting systems, weapons, swap-able weapons. The cosmetic customization and the build variety is something I haven't been able to find in any other pilot game. This game showcases what is now exceedingly rare in the gaming industry, truly showing off things that can only be done by a AAA studio, and using that power to bring to reality something that fans of mecha or just gaming in general could only dream of a decade ago.

Unlike in the older AC titles where strategic planning and resource management were still a thing, AC6 focuses more on mechanical execution of combat maneuvers, dodge timings and overall button pressing technique. The stagger mechanic rewards ultra-aggressive combat style over any type of cautious approach, meaning that the action is extremely frantic all the time. You can spam all your weapons simultaneously and most of the time an effective combat approach is just to mash all four weapon triggers without thinking. Failing a mission is not usually caused by your build or miscalculated strategic approach but more often just a consequence of wrongly timed button presses and badly executed combos.

Mech parts you regret having bought get fully refunded when sold and the only penalty of failing a mission is the annoyance of having to replay the mission again. This is underlined even more with the very forgiving checkpoint system, which on the other hand is really mandatory due to the overtuned boss encounters. Having no consequences for bad decisions means that there is also no incentive of getting invested in planning.

The linear story is expressed through brief and meaningless radio chatter that supposedly tries to be cool and serious but ends up being deeply embarrassing to mature audience.

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198116247721,"Top 3 Things I Liked:

Solid Gameplay – Moving your character around, shooting stuff—it's fun and engaging.
Great Graphics – Looks fantastic; AAA quality all the way.
Mech Building – They simplified the process nicely,  a little bare-bones but, the customization system isn't overly tedious.
Top 3 Things I Think the Game Fails At:

Control Scheme – The mech doesn't move like a real mech. Nothing about the movement feels mechanical—you're just controlling a person, not an Armored Core.
Plus, the controls are awkward. I keep boosting in the wrong direction, and it doesn't feel like a skill issue; the mech gets hung up on terrain or dashes in the wrong way. It’s as if the game expects you to fight its controls rather than letting you explore and use the commands freely. I’ve never written a critique quite like this before; movement just feels off.

Mechanics and UI – on the mech customization, it's not tedious but, there's limited parts- so the builds all feel rock, paper, scissors. The UI is basic and lacks what I think is important feedback, making customization less satisfying.

Franchise Expectations – AC has never been known for its story or music, and I thought this one might improve on that, but it didn’t. It seems like many of the combat mechanic issues from AC 2 are still present, but masked with fancy dash mechanics for faster paced combat, unfortunately this introduces some goofy control issues. (I'll try again with a controller and a joystick, Maybe this is a keyboard mouse thing.) 
Was disappointing to see the mech-building aspect take a backseat to try and appeal to a broader audience. However, it's really not a bad system - I just thought it wasn't as good as some of it's predecessors. (nothing was as bad as AC 3).
While it’s not a bad game, the control issues and the reduction in depth in key areas really ruin the experience for me.

Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198064978627,"This is a very conflicting review cause the game is fun but has so many short sighted issues that all in all it just isn't worth the full price. The game has shifted the franchise to a very ""speedball"" style of play almost like Doom. Everything is constant motion yet the system doesn't even make sense. You can walk with your legs, but spend 90% sliding around yet despite of this there's no way to permanently toggle it on or off. You have to activate sliding every single time you start walking, god forbid you DO stop. Sliding also doesn't use you're energy meter despite using your boosters constantly which feels like a way to forceably enable the fast paced mechanics without worrying about balancing. On top of that, most bosses you'll fight have unlimited energy supplies and will simply fly around the entire time. You'll likely spend most of the match just turning around trying to find them. But there's still more issues..

-Despite being a core dynamic the auto targeting is incredibly sloppy at times. When going against multiple opponents the tracking system till often turn and begin targeting a different enemy then the one you're trying to or have been attacking. On the boss fight of the 3rd ending alone I missed the fatal shot on the first stage and got killed because when the enemy was staggered my Core turned to fire on an enemy OFF SCREEN that got too close behind me and triggered the targeting to swap.

-enemy and boss stats will often be skewed against your favor in other ways then limitless flight, such as stagger bars that massively drop almost instantly after you land a shot and fade to zero faster then it takes to reload

-While there's a lot of guns and weapons, so many of them are incredibly redundant making most of them virtually useless, being out classed by something virtually identical but slightly better. Most of the active player base seems to mostly stick to a sold 12 or so weapons over all. 

-mech builds also feel fairly limited. Even if you wanna go full speedball and make a high speed glass canon you likely wont be able to meet the energy requirements for about half of the more interesting guns. Heavy builds tend to be too slow for the enemies that can constantly fly around and are more like being on the wrong side of target practice

-You have an INSANE amount of customization, able to make or download decals and apply them limitlessly, however there is no mirroring option meaning left and right symmetry must be painstakingly done by hand. As well, there is no option to save customized patterns for individual parts, you have to save the entire robot design. God forbid you need to change JUST the legs or something for a single mission and forget to, all you work is gone.

-the story was honestly a lil mid and the whole play it 3 times to unlock 4 different missions each play through for a different ending thing is pretty lame. All of the endings are basically just ""FromSofts usual Existential Nihilism""  packed with slightly different flavors

-Many of the stats and effects aren't directly listed or are poorly labeled with small pictographs that you need to pull up the help screen for to get a explanation of. One Stat, Stagger damage modifier, doesn't seem to be listed at all. Some Melee weapons do more damage to staggered enemies and actually makes them better for certain builds, but you have to go to reddit or a 3rd party site to find that out.

-no melee only builds, you cant equip them to your right hand at all and they wouldn't be viable with the face paced ranged style of combat loop that makes up the game. 

-Missions for the most part are very short. Dying and repeating boss fights pads gameplay time, as does the multi play throughs for all endings

While on the whole I did very much enjoy playing this, at times it felt more like a chore to slog through. it has a lot or potential and I hope they make a sequel with more refined combat loop, but all in all I can't in good faith reccommend this as a full price game because it feels unfinished in terms of actual game play.",False,2,0,1759636859,N/A,Steam
Lies of P,1888160,59.99,13,solo/multiplayer,Action,76561198203224497,"Kind of got ruined by some very asinine boss fights. The rules of that your mech is constrained to is often just not applied to the boss, which is like 90% of the difficulty in this game. You're fighting mechs are are supposedly and equivalent of yours, but like, they will just outright cheat by ignoring the rules that apply to you.

For example, one of the rules that you're subjected to is your thruster energy. Quick boosts consumes your thrusters, and so is flying. Then you have enemy mech bosses that will just be in perpetual flight 90% of the fight while also dodging with quick boosts, completely disregarding the thruster energy component of the game. It's like fighting bosses that have infinite stamina in a souls game, where if you get unlucky, they will just unleash a series of combo that lasts forever.

Another is the stagger. When you get staggered, it's always a fixed time depending on your mech build. Bosses however, will just get staggered for almost random amounts of time. They can get staggered a full 5 seconds, or they can get staggered for a full 0.5 seconds. I'd almost call this a bug, but the game is 2 years old and happened so often that I will just call it a feature

And then there's the range. Enemies will just ignore the range limit on weapons. For example, you and an enemy both use a sniper, you both do a charged shot and you both land a hit, all at the same very far distance. You will take 600 damage while the enemy takes 27. Because you are ""out of weapon's effective range"". But the enemies will just ignore this rule. Game tells you you're a sucker and you take full damage.

This is my first AC so maybe my expectations were just out of alignment but this game is kind of dull. I love the jaundice nature of this world but not the actual story or how it's told. It's fromsoft so everyone talks way too slow. Pressing skip sometimes skips to the next line but other times it skips the entire breifing. It's like the want to make engaging with it's story as painful as possible. Okay, whatever, I'm here for the game play. 

Most missions have you face a lot of cannon fodder foes that pose zero threat to you, going down in a single hit. Only when a boss shows up, and that's not every mission, do you actually have to wake up. Facing either another AC or some big machine other. These fights are better but I fell in love with a duel shotgun build and that's been working against every AC I've faced. Similarly I've settled on a big fella killer build as well. This caused even the boss fights to quickly blur. This should be better the core of it is there. It's fast, combat can be fun. As is customizing your mech loadouts to fit your style. I got a little over halfway through the game, one that isn't particularly long, but lost any desire to press on as the game just gelled into a consistent mush of feeling the same. I dunno maybe in the back half it gets better, maybe I'll return to it. There are a lot of games out there however. I could just replay ZoE2...


Also what the fuck is the point of money? You can change your load out at checkpoints which I appreciate, it is fun to mess around with new build before going back to one of my standards when faced with a boss. However you have to own the part to change mid mission which no big deal you can sell things back for 1:1 of the purchase price. Again I like this as it makes experimentation more inviting but if your going that far why even have the money road block? Parts are already gated by the arena and story progress. Worst case you sold the part you want and you have to exit out of the mission and fall asleep as you one shot a bunch of MTs on the way to the boss, and that's pretty annoying.",False,0,2,1758736116,N/A,Steam

Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary game from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the action and its consequences have challenged my preconceptions about fine decisions is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Life is Strange's famous motto, ""This Action Will Have Consequences."" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what it meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now working at Life is Strange, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest developer on Steam.

Life is Strange,319630,0.0,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198103327749,"If you like games that take away your agency / control frequently and for long periods of time (multiple minute) with cut-scenes that you can't skip even on 2nd play-thrus and feel VERY disruptive to your gameplay so that the developers can better tell a story, then you might enjoy this. if you like having ""GUNS BAD"" and similar ideology subtly pushed at you, you might enjoy this. If you like having characters that (when you can actually control them) move at the pace of a elderly, disabled snail travelling uphill in the dead of winter, then you may enjoy this.

Otherwise, it'll be a matter of how much you can tolerate those things compared to the quality of the story experience. Story was ok - I tend to be a big fan of time-travel themes, the rest was so-so. That said, the frequent, slow, and long cinemas that kept taking away my agency for extended periods really soured the overall experience for me.

Also, just to be clear there ARE bits of dialog that you CAN skip, but ONLY after you have listened to the slow version once and then rewound time (and that's per play-thru so if you start over, then you STILL need to listen to the slow clip once before you can skip it). Also, while that applies to most dialog, it seemed like there were a few lines here and there that you couldn't skip and you definitely could not skip the cinemas that played at the beginning and end of each chapter as well as during whatever random story point they felt like.

Graphics is not good enough, sometimes it can not keep up with the emotion behind those great voice acting at all. For a game focusing on story and released in 2015, the character modeling could use more work. The music is fine as the story itself doesn't require too much.

The gameplay is unique, it feels like loading last choice in Visual Novel, but it does have some clever designs involving time reverse rather than simple save and load. But There are some flaws in terms of gameplay as well, irrelevant interactions like checking photos, opening drawers, Max's reaction can't be skipped, for important events, we have to wait for voice to end. And the last choice, I can not fast forward either after getting one ending. Max keeps saying ""should have"", it could be a hint for using rewind, but also annoying as it sounds like Max has no stand at all.

And the biggest problem, story. It starts with a fantasy disaster, which is not important until the end. Not a problem, let's work on the main plots, the crime and suspense, I have to say it does hide those clues well, when the truth is disclosed, those small but unusual points all make sense. But I also have to say the suspense is successful because the story is filled with a lot of common teenage problems and emotions, too much trivia that I gradually lost interest in tracking the murderer. And for the characters, they talk a lot to build their own background, but when it comes to key events, they quickly changed their opinion because our Max is totally persuasive if she insists. A simple rewind power is not good enough to put all this together.

The ending is a coin choice besides the game keeps telling our choices has impact, maybe just like Max's rewind, yeah, she can rewind, but in a short term, or even worse, her choices are meaningless after all. The superpower is given to Max, she could either sacrifice a lot of people to make a difference, make the changes constant, or she could give up her choice, and make all her nightmare experience in vain. I don't feel the bond between Max and Chloe, because it is Max who lives her choice again and again, and Chloe is not even there at the end, one week happy and horror experience is not enough for me to be touched.",False,2,0,1753337114,N/A,Steam
Life is Strange,319630,0.0,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198025093031,"The concept is good and there are some genuinely captivating moments, but they are drowned in a sea of absolute mediocrity. From the abuse of trite and obnoxious teen drama tropes to straight up bad writing, there is enough to fill up a whole course about how [b]not[/b] to write fiction here. I get that I'm not exactly the target audience and a certain degree of cringeness is to be expected due to the characters being teenagers and all, but that does not excuse the profound lack of logic and coherence of certain scenes and dialogues, not to mention the forced lingo that gives everything a sour ""40 year old trying to sound like a highschooler"" aftertaste.

A lot of people were left disappointed by the ending, particularly due to the fact that the only choice that truly matters in the end is the one you make in the last minute of gameplay. I honestly didn't mind that too much. True, the whole ""choices matter"" thing is little more than a marketing trick and very few and often minor details change from picking a dialogue choice instead of another ([spoiler]even Kate's death is eventually brushed off when Max changes all past events[/spoiler]) but in a story that is fundamentally about how tragedies happen and learning to make do with the hand you've dealt in life, that is honestly acceptable. What angered me is the fact that the writers wasted a lot of time dwelling in absolutely pointless sub-plots and school dramas, changing pace all of a sudden once they got to the last episode, which honestly is the best part of the whole game but it feels rushed, hamfisted and cheap. They really pulled a Shyamalan move trying to stage a big plot twist that just came out as a goofy asspull, which is sad since most of the last hours of the game are really intense and would've otherwise been really compelling.

I will spend a couple more words on the main characters, because I just feel like I have to: Chloe is an insufferable idiot. Like, seriously. There is no amount of daddy issues or teenage rebellion that can excuse being THIS stupid, and that seriously impacts the whole story in a negative way, since you're supposed to care for her. Max in turn is the epitome of ""basic yet pretentious white girl"", which also makes really hard to relate to her, at least for anyone who has a bare minimum of personality. The other characters range from ""functional to the plot"" to completely unremarkable so there's really not much to say about them. Except for Kate, maybe, which is the character I found more likeable - ironic, since she's supposed to be a Catholic bible-basher.

In short: lots and lots of wasted potential. I cannot recommend this to anyone except maybe to people who thoroughly enjoy cheesy braindead teen drama. Which, apparently, is quite a large audience.",False,5,0,1753203608,N/A,Steam

Life is Strange 2,532210,0.0,0,solo,Adventure,76561198314290040,"How do you follow up a beloved, critically acclaimed game that is based around a novel mechanic?

Instead of just settling for more of the same with some technical improvements, developer DONTNOD gives us a completely new story, new characters and, in a risky but brave move, complete drops the first game's signature time-rewind mechanic.

Despite this, the game still has the soul of Life Is Strange - The indie soundtrack and the sad-but-not-necessarily-depressing vibe, as well as a refreshingly realistic portrayal of American teenagers who swear, drink, smoke weed and have sex (all of which makes them come across as relatable, rather than extreme or even particularly cool).

Being a fan of the first game, I thought I was going to miss Max Caulfield's time-rewinding powers but it turns out the story is all the stronger for it because the stakes are higher when you can't save people's lives by rewinding time.

Unlike the first game (which kicked off the story with the murder of a stranger and then instantly brought them back to life) this game really packs some emotional punches by letting you spend time with the characters before tragedy strikes (spoiler: there are some character deaths throughout the game that you can't prevent and instead, all you can do is choose how to react to them).

Just like the first game's story was often concerned with sexism and the treatment of women, this game's story is often cornerned with racism (police brutality against minorities is a major plot point). A major difference though, is how much more vulnerable the new protaginsts are. 
Not only because they lack Max's power but also because they spend most of the game on the road and unlike Max, they don't have a choice.

A common criticism against this type of game is that your choices don't really matter because the main story is the same anyway. While it would have been nice to be able to visit some new locations and meet some new characters on a 2nd playthrough (pretty much my only complaint), your choices often DO influence your relationship towards other characters and character development is such a big part of the game that it even becomes a mechanic - Your little brother WILL pick up bad habits from you if you're not a good role model and unlike the first game, which simply let you choose between two endings once you reached the conclusion, this game has up to four endings (plus some minor variations) that depends on your actions throughout the story.

There's also a particularly heart-breaking scenario early in the game where players who choose to treat a character poorly may end up feeling guilty when they realize how pointless those choices actually were from a practical standpoint.

Stunning game, and I love how the models are made like legos, especially the hair, the lighting and environments are simply lovely

What a heartbreaking journey and characters development through all the twists and turns that they take.  You get to visit many different locations which is sometimes jarring to transition between chapters, but it offers variety as well. 

Sean is a great protagonist that has to assume the role of being both a parent and a brother after tragedy strikes, Daniel is the perfect annoying younger brother, and I know that will put some people off but this is what having a sibling is like. 

I opted for the ""happier"" ending since I didn't want our journey to be for naught

It's quite a heavy game emotionally, and there are some mild issues with pacing IMO with how long of time is spent on certain areas vs. others, but I would love to play through with some different choices in the future and get all the collectibles. 

I recommend this game on the basis that it's a great story, with some fun choices, yes there are some moments that are frustrating but overall I grew to love the characters and the story they've given us.

[h1] It wasn't just about two brothers. It was about our everyday life. [/h1]

[hr][/hr]

Life is Strange 2 shows how one day can change your whole life. One day you go back home from school, laugh, and prepare for an upcoming party. The next day your life turns upside down. You don’t have a house or even a trust fund. Life is strange indeed, and the game makes you face that reality from the first episode.

I also love how the developers show the main characters as wolves, because wolves are free, independent, and loyal, just like people want to be. This idea connects to something bigger, and yeah, it gets political, because everything is politics nowadays. Everyone in the world has the right to speak, rebel, and do whatever they want (without breaking the laws, though). And some countries don’t let you do that, like North Korea, even though people pretend it’s the only one. That’s a myth. This whole theme of freedom ties directly back into the wolves, who represent the life Sean and Daniel want but can’t fully have.

Anyways, politics is trash. I played this game and got all the endings two years ago, which means I’ve had a lot of time to sit with it and think. That’s why I’m even writing something this long.

The main message of the game, at least for me, is that you can’t escape reality, even if you literally run into the desert. Karen tried to do that when she left Sean and Daniel for the life she wanted, but she couldn’t escape the problems she carried inside herself. And honestly, that’s something we all do. We think changing jobs or moving somewhere new will magically reset us, but most of the time we’re just trying to find ourselves without even realizing it.

This connects to the road trip the boys take. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and I still want to. Just without the constant fear they dealt with. Brody Holloway became my inspiration here. He’s the perfect example of someone who doesn’t pretend to have life figured out. He just keeps moving, keeps observing, and lives with the basics: gas money, food, and cheap motels. He writes about life and the places he’s been, and that simplicity is honestly the point of traveling. 

Even stumbling from failure to failure helps you find yourself. This is Karen’s painting, by the way. It was behind her trailer. She was the perfect example of this idea. Going to New York was her first failure, not her last, but eventually she found peace. Not a glamorous peace, but a real one. In the desert, surrounded by people who understood her.

And when you think about Episode 5, climbing all those rocks to reach the top of the canyon, it ties everything together. You start to understand how small we are in this world, how little control we have, and how the journey changes us more than the destination ever could.

Everyone in the game pushes you to think about the future. At least that’s how it felt to me. Even characters like Stanley and Arthur, who are just living peacefully in the desert. They show that there’s nothing wrong with choosing a life outside society’s expectations. Karen talks about how society forces rules on us, but the truth is simple: everyone’s different. You should do what feels right, make the choices that matter to you, and live by your own rules.

Daniel’s situation in Episode 4 also fits into this pattern. It’s a perfect example of how not to live your life. Don’t let people manipulate you, no matter how convincing they sound. And yeah, it starts to sound like a political campaign, but it’s not meant to be one.

The game doesn’t avoid loss either. Three deaths hit you: Esteban, then Mushroom, and then Finn. Everything changes so fast you barely have time to process it. That’s life too.

One thing the game repeats over and over is the importance of family. Even when it’s really freaking bad. They’re the people who raised you, and that alone is a reason for respect. Brody hated his family and tried to run from them, but eventually his mom got cancer, and he had to come back. Family pulls you in whether you like it or not. Sean hated Karen for leaving, but once they reunited, he understood her reasons and forgave her. Forgiveness is one of the hardest things humans can do.

Even Episode 3, which wasn’t as exciting for me, fits into this whole theme of freedom and connection. Sitting at the campfire, talking with people who want the same thing you want, feels real and wholesome. Everyone there just wants to see the world. And honestly, the world is small when you think about people. You’ll meet the same person twice in your life with a 50 percent chance.

Road trips only add to that. Being on the road gives you unforgettable experiences with people who share their stories. Everyone you meet has a story, and traveling is really just learning from them. Some people are open to new connections, even strangers like truckers. And Brody, again, is the perfect example. He’s in the A++ tier in my imaginary tier list for a reason. He helped Sean and Daniel with his last bit of money just so they could keep going.

I can’t say exactly which episode was the best, because each one has its own lesson and vibe. But Episodes One, Two, and Four hit me the hardest. They felt the most emotional and relatable.

[h1] АУФ ГОЛОВНОГО МОЗГА ИЛИ УСПЕТЬ ЧЕРЕЗ ВСЮ АМЕРИКУ ЗА 5 ЭПИЗОДОВ [/h1]

Life is Strange 2 разочаровал многих фанатов серии, и это не без оснований. Несмотря на хорошую идею и потенциал для глубокого сюжета (хотя кого я обманываю, ВСЕ РУШИТСЯ ЕЩЕ С ПЕРВОГО ЭПИЗОДА), игра страдает от множества проблем, которые затмевают положительные моменты.

Первое, что бросается в глаза, это перенасыщенность повесткой, которая, на первый взгляд, должна была добавить реализма и актуальности. Однако вместо этом она выглядит навязчиво и искусственно, теряя свою естественность. Создается ощущение, что разработчики сделали ставку на социальные вопросы, забыв про ключевые аспекты — интересный сюжет и развитых персонажей. И логику, потому что добро и зло тут как в Hellaverse - диаметрально, и без какого либо высмеивания и сатиры, нелогично противоположны.

Герои игры - отбросы общества. Что один что второй братья Диасы представлены как типичные мигранты-мудаки учиняющие беспредел ""без мести"", (но даже если это ради другой главной завязки сюжета - то почему?! И это относится к логике поступков окружающих их персонажей), что делает сопереживание за их судьбы невозможным, если вы не феменистка из твитера. В моменте, да не в одном я не то что усомнялся в адекватности их действий - а в адекватности при создании этой игры вообще.

Постановка и режиссура оставляют желать лучшего. В игре часто встречаются затянутые и скучные сцены, которые только отвлекают от главной линии. Это снижает общее восприятие, и игроки начинают терять интерес к происходящему. Вместо эмоционального погружения мы получаем долгие диалоги и общение, которое утомляет, и уж тем более не заставляет задуматься или СОПЕРЕЖИВАТЬ.

Life is Strange 2 — это не сиквел, а отдельный, политизированный и наивный выкидыш во всей серии LiS. Обилие повестки, бездарная постановка и персонажи, делают этот проект ужасным. Возможно, лучше было бы оставить историю первой части незавершенной, чем пытаться развивать её в таком ключе.

[h1] BRAIN FEVER OR MAKE IT ACROSS AMERICA IN 5 EPISODES [/h1]

Life is Strange 2 disappointed many fans of the series, and with good reason. Despite the good idea and the potential for a deep plot (although who am I kidding, EVERYTHING COLLAPSES FROM THE VERY FIRST EPISODE), the game suffers from many problems that overshadow the positive aspects.

The first thing that catches your eye is the oversaturation of the agenda, which, at first glance, was supposed to add realism and relevance. However, instead it looks intrusive and artificial, losing its naturalness. It seems that the developers have relied on social issues, forgetting about the key aspects — an interesting plot and developed characters. And logic, because good and evil here, as in Hellaverse, are diametrically opposed, and without any ridicule or satire, illogically opposed.

The heroes of the game are the dregs of society. That one or the other Diaz brothers are presented as typical migrant assholes who commit lawlessness ""without revenge"", (but even if it's for the sake of another main plot plot, then why?! And this applies to the logic of the actions of the characters around them), which makes empathy for their fates impossible if you are not a Twitter feminist. At the moment, and not just in one thing, I did not doubt the adequacy of their actions - but in the adequacy of creating this game in general.

The production and direction leave much to be desired. The game often has drawn-out and boring scenes that only distract from the main line. This reduces the overall perception, and players begin to lose interest in what is happening. Instead of emotional immersion, we get long dialogues and communication, which is exhausting, and even more so does not make us think or EMPATHIZE.

Life is Strange 2 is not a sequel, but a separate, politicized and naive miscarriage in the entire LiS series. The abundance of the agenda, the mediocre staging and the characters make this project terrible. Perhaps it would be better to leave the story of the first part unfinished than to try to develop it in this way.",False,4,1,1759846930,N/A,Steam

I'm not sure if its because the main characters are younger and I had a more difficult time getting invested in them because a lot of the choices that were made by the characters and by the player felt childish or that the story just didn't connect with me, Now I know the leads are children here, so the childish responses and choices make sense for these characters, but it doesn't change the fact that it really felt frustrating watching them make bad choice after bad choice and then giving me the option between 2 or more bad choices. 

Now with that said, its not terrible, it just didn't connect with me. The music is still good and the art style is still the same as the first life is strange, so those are both points in favour of the game. I feel this game has less “game” to play.

It could still be decent, but it’s stuffed with in-your-face woke propaganda. You can see it most clearly in the way the characters are written. It’s full of old, worn-out clichés.

Almost everything here is black-and-white. People opposing mass migration are shown as xenophobes and fascists, or at best just rude and nasty to others. On the other hand, anarchists, hippies, gay people, and those living in communes are always nice, smiling, and cool.

Anyone tied to the church has to be a villain, or at least a brainwashed lunatic with no will of their own. In the end, of course, the church has to burn.

Migrants and minorities are always portrayed as good guys and victims. People protecting their country or opposing migration are painted as thugs. The border fence is “evil” and must be torn down to save the heroes.

There are also layers of symbolic references placed throughout the game. For instance, the main character bears a symbol of Baphomet on their sleeve.

Overall, the impression is that the game is designed less as a story-driven experience and more as a vehicle for conveying progressive ideas. After a while, it becomes difficult to ignore the sense that this message takes precedence over the narrative itself.

It’s disappointing, especially given the studio’s earlier achievements.

They tried some new ideas for the formula but for me it just doesn't work.

-The plot feels contrived the characters jumping from location to location doing stupid stuff for very stupid reasons. I get the MC is a kid but still. There are a few high points like the church which are legitimately cool and interesting. At points it feels like a slog to get through, a tighter story would've helped massively. The game doesn't draw you in like the first game did probably because rather than solving a mystery you're just running away.
-The 5 episode structure doesn't help, some episodes massively overstay their welcome and some parts feel like padding, if maybe 30% of the game was cut it would probably be much less of a chore to play through. I've played through LiS and Before the Storm multiple times but this game is too much of a slog to ever replay.
-The player doesn't get powers, instead it's his little brother, which is an interesting change but makes the game play much less fun.
-The characters aren't particularly memorable and you spend very little time with each group before the plot moves on. You get to influence Daniel but half the interactions are hidden behind weird dialogue triggers you'd need a guide to find. Even if you've been a great brother he still turns against you at points because ""the plot needs a conflict"" and Daniel being dumb/manipulated is most of the game's conflict.
-The choices in this game do matter but many are opaque and a few make no sense, if you don't phone a character in the first hour it changes the ending and she stops being your friend forever? but you never try to phone her at any other point in the game (even with a payphone lmao).
-The game also beats you over the head politically, I'm not even American but I can tell how much the writing got affected by the 2016 election. Plot starts from a racist bully and police brutality. You get beaten and detained by a ""build that wall"" guy who won't shut up about how evil Mexicans are. Racist rednecks beat you up (again). Civil border patrol try to murder you.

No one cares about Sean except some of the later events in the dessert. Only repeating how he have to be the adult one and protect brother and such. The game forces you to put priority of Daniel's happy first no matter what. That's stupid. Game of choice without a choice to be honest.

To more technical stuff - damn, this game bugged more than I expected, just because I moved a bit too quickly from the place, cause I didn't hear the next dialogues starts... like wtf, I had to reload checkpoints few times, that was annoying. Anyway, for me this game is kinda 5/10. 
It touches tough topics and they're showed without feeling that they're forced too hard, but overall the story wasn't that great for me. It had some good moments, but a lot of choices were forced to get it Daniel's way and I don't get it how people love his character.

While there were moments I really enjoyed, overall I feel it’s a step down from the first game. Despite Sean and Daniel’s story seeming like it should have more emotional impact than Sam’s in the first game, it just didn’t connect with me. The game ends in one of two ways, neither of which feels particularly satisfying: Sean’s life is either ruined by surrendering and going to prison, or he escapes to Mexico by forcing his way across the border (at least, those were the options presented to me). While reaching Mexico is the goal of the game, there isn’t enough shown of their arrival to make it meaningful. The brothers deal with some gang trouble, then have a beer and look at the ocean. There’s no real follow-up on Lyla or other supporting characters like Jacob or Brody, who helped the brothers along the way. It feels like there should have been an epilogue to show more of their new life, but instead we get maybe two minutes at most at the end, and that’s it.

Although, Origins come very close. The latter only losing out for me because of technical improvements in Inquisition (and these happen to be important for me).

That being said, this game has several flaws, though most of these are only 'optional' in the sense that they don't affect progressing through the main story.

The good:
[list]
    [*]Story
    [*]Dialogue
    [*]Voice acting
    [*]Controller support (of course this is only important for those who prefer to sit back and use a controller)
    [*]Some of the supporting characters
[/list]

The bad:
[list]
    [*]Side quests are often pointless and for the sake of being there
    [*]Navigating the world can feel tedious and a waste of time (esp. Hissing Waves, Forbidden Oasis, the Deep Roads)
    [*]Personally, I feel like the combat is mostly a matter of stats (gear) rather than tactics
    [*]Way too much elements of grinding that become super tedious and repetitive (with crafting materials, gold, and prestige)
[/list]

In summary, this game has an extremely well written story, with believable dialogues and character interactions. There are also a LOT of tedious pain-in-the-arse game-design choices that can make you feel like you're grinding half the time, rather than enjoying whatever the game has to offer.

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,9.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561199025497003,"Dragon Age: Inquisition is BioWare’s third entry in the Dragon Age series and one of its most ambitious RPGs. Built on the Frostbite engine, it expands the world dramatically—combining open-area exploration, political intrigue, and party-driven storytelling into one massive adventure. It’s both a continuation of the saga and a reinvention of its formula.

The story follows the Inquisitor, a survivor of a magical catastrophe who gains the power to seal dangerous rifts between worlds. As leader of the newly formed Inquisition, the player must unite factions, recruit allies, and face a growing demonic threat. The main narrative balances global stakes with personal choices, allowing players to shape political and moral outcomes through dialogue and decisions.

Gameplay blends exploration and tactical combat. The world is divided into large regions filled with quests, collectibles, and dynamic encounters. Players can switch between real-time action or top-down tactical view for precision control. Team composition, positioning, and ability synergy are key to surviving harder fights, keeping combat engaging across dozens of hours.

Companions remain the emotional core of the experience. Characters like Cassandra, Solas, Iron Bull, and Dorian each bring strong personalities, distinct motivations, and moral perspectives. Their interactions—through banter, loyalty missions, and romance—create some of BioWare’s best relationship writing. Every choice in dialogue strengthens or strains bonds within the party.

Visually, the game is stunning. The Frostbite engine delivers vast landscapes, from frozen mountains to deserts and ancient ruins. Lighting, weather effects, and detailed armor designs make exploration rewarding. Even a decade later, Inquisition still looks modern and cinematic.

The soundtrack by Trevor Morris enhances both scale and emotion. Orchestral and choral themes underscore the Inquisition’s rise, while quiet pieces support reflective moments in camp or dialogue. Voice acting across the cast is consistently strong, giving life to the game’s layered writing.

Overall, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a monumental RPG that successfully blends character-driven storytelling with grand world-building. Its scale can sometimes overwhelm, but its heart lies in choice, connection, and consequence. It stands as one of BioWare’s finest achievements—an epic about leadership, faith, and the power of unity in a fractured world.",True,1,0,1762625693,N/A,Steam

- Choices: As far as ""choices matter"" goes I think this game does fairly well though definitely not to the level of DAO. There are a few game changing choices that will give you entirely different questlines and loads of smaller ones that mostly effect companion approval and cutscenes as well as world flavour type outcomes. You can also see the relults of smaller choices in War Table quests.

- World building: DAI builds off established lore from the series and fleshes out a lot of cultures within the world. There is lots of world history related dialogue and codex entries for all you world-building nerds out there.

- Characters: perhaps the best thing about DAI (like it's predecessors) is it's companion characters and advisers. Each one is uniquely compelling and have fleshed out personalities. Everyone has reasons for what they believe and for being part of the cause. They will also agree/disagree both with the pc and other companions and can even leave if you clash enough. The companion questlines are also enjoyable and tailored well to each companion.

- Music: seriously the music in this game (and particularly the Trespasser DLC) is just unreasonably delicious
- Graphics: still hold up well 10 years later, it's wallpaper worthy in some areas
- Areas: There is a huge variety of environments to explore with their own unique vibes
- Combat: pretty good variety of options for builds and generally enjoyable combat. There are also difficulty settings that you can change during the game

Cons:
- Bloat: there are A LOT of ""go-for/fetch"" quests, and while I didn't mind them much I can see how they could be quite frustrating, particularly for the time-poor player. Some areas (looking at you Hinterlands) are also just too darn big and if i have to fight one more bear I'm going to cry

- Animations: be warned, ye who seek to play feminine characters or anything other than a brick outhouse. For whatever reason the devs decided that one style of animation would fit all possible characters you may create. You will be LOCKED IN to the most APE-ISH walking and sitting animations. Like MADAM YOU NEED TO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR. It is distractingly goofish on my petite elf Inquisitor but likely works well on heavy set lads. 
    - Another animation issue is that cutscenes often show items still in your hand from gameplay. This has resulted in my character STABBING herself in the face with her own weapons, gesturing wildly in peoples faces with blades, and trying to drink water with a LIT TORCH in her hand. 
    - There are also the classics, like characters standing on chairs instead of sitting or having items glued to their open hands but I find this endearing as I now view it through the rose-tinted lens of nostalgia.

- Player Character Dialogue: the dialogue options that you are offered are often very generic and make it difficult to give your character much of a personality, particularly when compared with the silent pc of Origins or the three personality options you could choose in Dragon Age 2. The Trespasser DLC gives you the chance to develop your pc more but the base game is lacking in this department.

- Sex: ew, but thankfully optional

Overall DAI is an absolute banger and truly my personal GOAT. If you enjoy anything open-world/fantasy/RPG this is a must play, even if you haven't/can't play the other Dragon Age games.",True,0,0,1762268902,N/A,Steam

I loved the story, and I feel like they did justice to the characters both old and new. Overall the story has a much bigger scale than I expected, with some pretty epic twists that keep you engaged through the whole journey. 

Visually the game looks great, even in 2025. Frostbite engine was way ahead of its time and does a great job with the wide variety of environments and cool lighting setups. It helps that the art direction and tone is very coherent and fits the Dragon Age's gritty world. (unlike you know which game)

The combat is decent, but the controls are a bit clumsy and can take a while to get used to. I mainly played as a mage and a bit with a rogue. Rogue was surprisingly fun, having a parry mechanic is neat af! 

And I loved that the game doesn't hold your hand for most puzzles, the characters don't mumble the solutions to you if you're stuck for longer than 10 seconds, and a lot of the puzzles were very fun to solve! 

On the downsides, the open world bloat is a bit excessive. Especially the shards, massive amount of effort for a practically nonexistent payoff. I love my open world side content, but it needs to have more variety and a more balanced effort/reward ratio.

I am more than 10 years late in writing a review for this game - I skipped it when it was new, but I played DA1 and DA2 before that and now in 2025 I've had a replay of the trilogy, playing through all available DLCs as well.

I will be skipping Veilguard, at least for now. Bioware was wonderful with their RPGs, but their glory days have long passed. Thank you Bioware developers of old for the wonderful experiences you have created.

Times change, so the current king is Larian, as many would agree. 

Inquisition is a good game. It has traces of greatness, but it definitely pales in comparison to Origins. 

Origins has that perfect mix of joy and sorrow and continues to be my all-time favorite. Origins soundtrack is incredible and game characters are like your best friends and family.

DA2 is probably the weakest in the series, but it works well and should not be skipped.

The magic mix in Inquisition is more sour than before in my opinion - the story especially.

Inquisition offers better graphics and more action oriented gameplay while DA1 and DA2 excel in precise tactical combat.

Some players may not like all the characters in Inquisition. I skipped on 2 characters and focused on the rest of the party.

One thing that I must mention - Hawke in Inquisition looked nothing like my Hawke in DA2. Developers created a different face tattoo set which broke the immersion for me. Also Dragon Age Keep sucks pretty much - file import in DA2 worked better IMO.

Inquisition is somewhat glitchy, especially in Trespasser DLC where I had serous issues (black screen after Eluvian travel).

Side quests in Inquisition are numerous and as other reviewers have pointed out - are similar to the kill and fetch type quests used so often in MMOs.

These side quests prolong the game possibly too much, and they are typically inferior to the main quests. Main questline is not very long.

The combat is the worst in the series. The game started as an MMO and you can tell.

Roughly 11 hours into my first real play through - have played about 10 hours a year or so ago as well.

After about 11 hours with Dragon Age: Inquisition, I’ve come away with mixed feelings. The game is undeniably pretty, with sweeping landscapes, a strong soundtrack, and the kind of lore rich world that is expected from a Dragonage IP. But beneath the surface, there are some rough edges that make the experience frustrating at times.

Skill Trees and Character Building:

The skill trees feel restrictive, almost as if the game is trying to force me down a predetermined path rather than letting my character grow into a multifaceted build. Instead of encouraging creative experimentation, I feel boxed into roles that don’t fully reflect how I’d like to play.

Combat and AI:

Combat is clunky. The lack of a robust tactics system is puzzling in a party-based RPG where multiple companions fight alongside you. I want to strategize, but instead I’m stuck wrangling poor companion AI. They often behave ineffectively, making fights more chaotic than they need to be. Even the pause-and-play tactical feature struggles - it frequently gets interrupted by the terrain, companion positioning, and enemy AI 'quirks' (or bugs), leaving it more awkward than empowering (or fun).

On top of that, the click-to-move/play feature from Dragon Age: Origins, Awakening, and Dragon Age II is gone even on the PC version. Without it, the game feels less like the tactical dungeon-crawler, party-based RPG that made the series distinct, and more like an open world action game in the vein of Horizon Zero Dawn but with companions. It’s a fundamental shift in design philosophy that left me feeling disconnected from the combat flow and party management that used to define Dragon Age.

Exploration and World Design:

The game world looks beautiful, but actually moving through it can be a chore. Too often I find myself tediously hopping over small rocks and uneven terrain that should feel trivial to cross. On top of that, enemy respawns feel relentless, more like an MMO mobile game than a living world. It kills immersion when areas repopulate too quickly, turning exploration into a grind rather than an adventure. (How many bears are in Storm Coast?!)

The minimap compounds the frustration by failing to show trails, which means I’m constantly flipping back to the full map just to navigate simple paths.

Quest and Search Mechanics:

Quests often lean on the “search” feature, but it only works about 70% of the time. I end up pressing the search button repeatedly before it actually points me to what I’m supposed to find. It’s another clunky design that slows the pace and adds unnecessary annoyance.

On top of that, having to constantly go back to The War Room for seemingly no good reason when I could just select quests from my journal and fast travel directly is as tedious as it is pointless. The only purpose it seems to serve is to add perks, which could simply be done when leveling up your characters and forcing you to wait on operations - operations that can take upwards of 20+ real life hours - or gather resources without having to go out into the overworld (and the amount of resources, whether its gold or herbs are handed out in tiny amounts, you may as well go into the overworld for resource aquisition). This mechanical essentially is there to seemingly make the player play through all the sloppy side quests while you wait for the main storyline to be opened up after hours of waiting on operations to be finished. The waiting, I believe, is there to make the game feel like there is more content than there really is. The side quests are mostly boring fetch quests that do nothing to further the plot. In the early game The War Room is presented as a hub where Inquisition agents hash out strategy, but in practice it’s nothing more than a glorified fast-travel screen with a dramatic title that forces the player to either wait real life hours in order to proceed or go off and finish boring side quests. The illusion of depth here makes the tedium sting even more.

Potions and Resource Management:

Yes, characters can craft potions - but only after unlocking the right quest line, and only at specific crafting tables. It’s never made obvious, and it certainly doesn’t allow the kind of flexibility Origins had, where you could brew potions mid-quest. But the bigger issue is this: mages can no longer heal! In a series where mages were the cornerstone of party survival, the absence of dedicated healing spells is baffling. Instead, the game leans heavily on its restrictive potion system, which forces constant micromanagement and frequent returns to camps. What should feel like tactical preparation ends up feeling like arbitrary limitation, stripping away both player freedom and the strategic weight of having a healer in the party.

Final Thoughts (So Far):

For all its beauty, atmosphere, and rich lore, Dragon Age: Inquisition is weighed down by awkward systems, clunky mechanics, and poor AI. The removal of staple features like click-to-play only highlights how far it’s drifted from its dungeon-crawler-esque roots.

If Dragon Age: Origins was an 8.5/10, I can’t imagine grading Inquisition higher than a 6/10 at this point. What astonishes me most are the overwhelmingly positive reviews this game has received since release. Either I’m missing something monumental, or a large swath of critics and players have mistaken sheer size for substance. It’s not the first time a bloated spectacle has been confused for greatness, but one does wish the bar were set a little higher.

The only good this about this game it's its visuals, it still stands and looks okay in 2025. Other than that it is hard to find something good.
Combat is clunky and buggy, line level writing is meh, main plot is terrible (especially the main villain in a style of ""Palpatine returned, again""), the WORST mount mechanics in history of games and a lot of padding content. Like 90% of the game is meaningless padding and war table shenanigans only makes immersion worse.
A did I forget to mention the atrocious loot system? 99% of the stuff you loot is basically useless, game economy is stale and you can barely find anything useful from vendors with money becoming meaningless very quick, so the only gear is worth wearing is either crafted one(crafting system was surprisingly not bad), boss drop or atrarium treasure(atrarium mini-games were somewhat enjoyable).
Companion cast is also disappointing with only worthy mention of duo of Cassandra and Varric, but even their chemistry is mostly the merit of Dragon Age 2 above all else.

Yes because the story, scenery, music are phenomenal. Game has made me cry a couple times, the characters are so endearing, and for being a fantasy MMO the story line is incredibly solid (nowhere near as convoluted at WoW). No to trying the game if you do not like Korean MMOs. I say this because Korean MMOs are notorious for having end game content rely heavily on spending real money  or grinding the shit out of everything making casual play hard.  If you know this going in at least for me it made it less of an issue.

I really like the gameplay, which is intuitive and dynamic compared to other MMOs I've seen online where you have a stationary character and attacks. Graphically speaking, it's extraordinary, with a great style (although it could do with some optimisation).

The story has really grabbed me even if its the classic ""hero chosed by destiny"" thing, everything builded around that idea is amazing. I don't miss a single piece of paper so I can find out every little detail, and when I can, I don't skip any cutscenes (And I don't do it in every game).

The progression system is a bit slow, it's true, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, especially with all the improvements they've made over time.

I'm getting off the hamster wheel.

This game's raid combat and different classes were the only saving grace for me. In the last few weeks, I found myself enjoying solo raids on my rat alts because playing them was a breath of fresh air compared to running the same 6 gold earners for the 9000th time. I enjoyed my time with the game playing with my friends and random people but if there's one sentence I can use to described this game is ""It's as wide as the ocean and as deep as a puddle."" Every older raids or activities they've introduced is abandoned because people only interact with the few latest content.

Almost every system in this game is debilitating and riddled with layers of RNG: it's by design to time gate slowing down progression. It uses so many predatory psychological manipulation like FOMO to keep to playing in the hopes that you get lucky: if you just get one good Frost/Flame Hell Key run, you'd save millions of gold from just getting a few Grudge, Keen Blunt, Cursed Doll, Raid Captain or Adrenaline books. But at the end of day, it's not going to happen. When you succeed, you don't feel good and want to do it again. You feel good that you never have to interact with that system ever again (like Transcendence or Elixirs). Designing progression systems like that makes it inevitable that your game with lose players. Old systems (Elixirs) get reworked to be easier to min-max because there's a new system that will make more money (Ark Grid). The game's reward system with the raids encourages gatekeeping by design because you want to finish your three gold earning raids ASAP so you can move on to the other 5 gold earning characters. The mokoko bootcamp event doesn't really help new players learn the raid, it only helps new players finish a raid by getting carried.

At the end of it, this game is just a predatory mobile game with a good combat/raid design. The game controls how much you get to play: everything is time-gated. It's heavily pay-to-win and has gotten worse with new content like Ark Grid and Paradise. The RNG is so egregious that it's impressive to say the least: one tapping/free tapping a weapon to +25 compared to the average cost is several millions of gold and compared to pity is probably in the tens of millions. When I found out about the Ark Grid system, I realized that this game isn't going to change. Smilegate will just nerf old systems (because it doesn't make a lot of money anymore) and introduce new systems to keep the hamsters on the wheel.

I, too, have seen the light; I've escaped and gotten off the hamster wheel. Stay away from this game and every predatory games like it.

Combat is insanely fun, class fantasy is incredibly satisfying, but it's all buried under so many layers of garbage gambling systems that Smilegate has effectively turned a diamond back into coal.

Every single interaction with progression systems feels like it was designed with malicious intent to cause the player to swipe and avoid the headache, and the western playerbase could have taken a more casual approach were it not for the system-driven FOMO compelling even free to play gamers to invest insane amounts of time to try and keep up with the average dolphin, constantly pulling the bar higher and higher for what party finder considers ""an acceptably geared character"".

I understand that they wished to monetize progression as their business model to keep the game free to play, but it is done in such an obscenely hostile way that you'll never get good value for your money: if we compared with other MMO competitors like WoW or FFXIV where a 14-15 bucks monthly subscription will give you access to THE ENTIRETY of the game provided you just play, spending 200 dollars a year on Lost Ark gets you nowhere. It averages out to a drop in the bottomless bucket of resources you need to continue progressing your character depending on store pack releases and gold currency exchange. Cosmetics are generally low-value or mediocre at best, but that's a matter of personal taste, I am uninterested in the KR trend of suits or formal wear skins and would much rather have good fantasy armour.

I've played this game since launch, and even swiped on occasion, but it might be time to finally give it a rest and warn people who might be unaware of it just what kind of predatory cesspool awaits them, and it will remain that way because Smilegate simply does not care about making a good game, they are perfectly content milking their dwindling playerbase until it runs dry.",False,23,1,1763118358,N/A,Steam

Marvel Rivals,2357570,0.0,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Free To Play",76561199184821242,"Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 hero shooter where Blizzard removed one tank, added a battle pass, and relied on the power of addiction to do the rest.

You queue for:

* **Tank** – Emotional punching bag
* **Damage** – Aim training with extra ego
* **Support** – Full-time babysitter with part-time healing beam

Then you load into a match and immediately realize:

> “Ah. No one here has ever seen the objective.”

---

### Pros

* When a fight pops off, it’s genuinely *incredible*:

  * Ults chaining
  * Pings flying
  * Abilities overlapping
  * You have no idea what’s happening but there are colors and numbers and someone is yelling “HUGE!”

* Wild hero variety:

  * Cyber ninja with a family problem
  * Grandma sniper with life advice and biotic bullets
  * Sentient hamster in a murder ball
  * Cowboy, sorcerer queen, traumatized bird archer, K-pop tank, angry Greek lightning lady…
    Every match is a crossover episode.

* 5v5 makes individual plays more impactful, so you can hard-carry a fight and then pretend it was “team effort” while quietly replaying it in your head for the next 3 hours.

* Game *feels* amazing to play: movement, shooting, animations, sound design—Blizzard polish is still there under the battle pass crumbs.

* With friends, it’s peak gaming:

  * One guy tilted
  * One guy cracked
  * One guy on Lucio “for fun” wall-riding nowhere near the teamfight

---

### Cons

* Solo queue is a social experiment that should be illegal.

  * Tank: flanks
  * DPS: snipes from spawn
  * Support: “group up” pings and quiet sobbing

* Ranked feels like this:

  * Win 5, rank stays same.
  * Lose 5, rank plummets 3 divisions and your will to live with it.

* Monetization went from “loot boxes are bad” to “$20 for this one skin, soldier.”

* People will actually type “diff” in chat unironically, as if that explains why they spent the entire game dueling the enemy Ana behind the point.

* New player experience:

  * Tutorial teaches you basics
  * First real match puts you against a Smurf Sojourn with 3000 hours and laser eyes

---

### Peak Overwatch 2 Moments

* Landing the most beautiful sleep dart of your life, saving the fight, and someone still types “heal diff.”

* Perfect team wipe with your ult, POTG secured… until the game gives it to Cassidy for pressing Q in a straight line.

* Joining voice chat:

  * *“Hey guys :)”*
  * Instant silence, then someone breathes into their mic and locks Hanzo.

* Saying “last game” after a bad loss and then chasing redemption for another two hours.

* Swapping heroes out of spite and suddenly playing 10x better, forcing you to accept your main might actually be the problem.

---

### Final Diagnosis

Overwatch 2 is:

* 30% amazing hero shooter
* 30% emotional rollercoaster
* 40% “I swear I’m uninstalling after this match”

**8.5/10**
When it’s bad, it will ruin your mood.
When it’s good, nothing else quite hits the same.

Would once again uninstall in a fit of rage, see a cool new skin on Twitter, and reinstall before the download bar even finished disappearing.",True,0,0,1764135344,N/A,Steam

The trilogy are my favourite RPG games to date. The first game might be difficult for some people to get into as it is extremely slow, but trust me, the rest of the games are worth it.

The choices you make drastically effect the progress/ experience of the current game and the next game in line. The combat, exploration, dialogue and soundtrack are fantastic. It does make you very immersed. The remastered graphics are very well done and you do not need a NASA spec PC to make this game look incredible.

The DLC included with the LE are also great but it is a shame the ME3 multiplayer never was imported to this version.

I have been recommended by one of my mates to play this game with mods to change my experience. A player called Synth has made a modpack which has very good feedback for any of you are interested -

From starting the first game and learning through talking to all sorts of species and reading through data collections to know more about this universe;. This game was very well made for back in 2007 and beyond and enhanced in this remake. The story is amazing i enjoyed it and the lore. It drew me in from our protagonist Comm. Shepard learning their past and going through the story and each game. It is interesting in a way that your choices matter i noticed it much more in the 2nd installment. And the lives of the other characters depend on our choices and much more. You transfer your shepard to each game and you determine the personality of shepard through dialogue and action choices.

The story is so phenomenally told, with characters that are unique, fascinating, and satisfyingly complex. Many of the cast of characters will forever possess a piece of my heart (especially Commander Shepard themself, Liara, Garrus, and Tali'Zorah, Joker, Jack, Miranda, EDI, Cortez)--though, ahem, we don't talk about Jacob.

The games also have a gorgeous soundtrack that draws you into the wardrum heartbeat of the series, though there are plenty of tracks suited to thoughtful character moments, and capturing the sheer majesty of setpieces (like seeing the Destiny Ascension and the Citadel for the first time--WOW!). 

The Legendary Edition updates a ton of textures, and consolidates everything into a clean menu of the three games that keeps it all feeling consistent and meaningful across the trilogy. 

Super highly recommend--fantastic for fans of the series, and perfect for people picking it up for the first time. I wish I could experience it all for the first time, but honestly, every time I play this immersive game is a joy. Mass Effect always evokes a kind of wonder, passion, and curiosity all braided together that makes this game unforgettable and genuinely life-changing (especially for being one of the first games to ever show same-sex relationships; Liara and Jane/female Shepard will forever mean so much to me for that).",True,0,0,1763951445,N/A,Steam

There’s a constant feeling that what you do matters, and that these characters are more than just NPCs. It's important that the story continues from one game to another and it's something that enhances your connection to the characters.

The game is full of quiet, human moments in between the big cinematic battles: talking to your squad in the ship. The world-building is rich (different species, cultures, politics) and it doesn't feel like a lore dump.

The Legendary Edition also makes the experience feel smoother and more cohesive. The game was never top of the line in terms of mechanics or gameplay or even graphics compared to respective competition. It is the feeling it leaves after completing the Trilogy. You feel like you've lived through an epic space story. So that makes it one of my favorite games and an unforgettable emotional experience in gaming.

Mass Effect Legendary,1328670,5.99,17+,solo,"Action, RPG",76561198079660655,"It's been quite fun replaying the trilogy with updated graphics... but I feel like this was an incredibly low effort attempt at a Remaster.

For starters, the combat is every bit as tedious as the original trilogy-- especially ME2. All enemies act like bullet sponges, even on the easier difficulties. Combat isn't hard, it just gets frustrating having to empty a clip of 30-50 rounds into every single enemy. This is something that can literally be tweaked in a matter of seconds and wouldn't have taken more than a day to perfect. The devs just couldn't be bothered to do so. Squad powers and biotics (if you play adept) are extremely unreliable too, just like the originals. They fire off at weird angles and hardly ever behave as expected.

However, most people-- myself included-- play for the characters and the story... but even that didn't manage to see any reasonable improvement. In fact, I've actually had a couple of errors that I never experienced with the original 3 games: and those are problems with the relationship system. In ME1, I was friendly with Liara, told her there wasn't anything romantic between us, and romanced Ashley... but somehow I ended up getting the Liara ending. I thought maybe I made a mistake and carried on... then, in the second game, I romanced Tali (as always) but acted friendly with Jack and told her there was nothing romantic between us... I then somehow got thrown into the Jack romance, locked out of the Tali romance (""end things with Jack"", which I couldn't do because Jack refused to talk to me), and then when I met with Liara she said she was ""tossed aside for a tattooed woman with anger issues""-- again, I never even started the romance with Jack, I started it with Tali.

For me, this is by far the worst issue because it means you have to frequently reload the game and time each interaction carefully. It wasn't a problem in the originals, so I don't see why it is suddenly a problem in the remaster. It's clearly something to do with the relationship points behind the scenes.

Speaking of Tali... the replacement photo of Tali still feels like a massive cop-out. There's clearly been no thought put into it whatsoever, which feels incredibly frustrating when the rest of the world-building has been so masterfully done. It's not just about this one character, it's about an entire race of people who are central to the plot... it should have been a massive reveal, but instead it was just thrown in there without a care in the world. Honestly, I'd rather they just deleted that scene than to try and fix one bad photoshop job with another. Her mouth isn't even close to the filter on her mask, it just looks weird. You can find dozens of speculative fan art of the Quarians which do a much better job of imagining their look.

Lastly, all of these issues would have been much easier to fix if console commands or mods were easy to use. I have no idea why the devs went out of their way to put so many roadblocks in the way to prevent players from doing these things, but it's just another reason to find this game disappointing.

If you have the originals-- download some graphics mods. 

If you don't, wait until this game goes on at least 70% sale, and hopefully you won't be too disappointed. I, unfortunately, was.

I really have no energy to express just how absolutely god awful this game is for new players. I am 8 fucking hours into the first game of the trilogy and it's insane how absolutely terrible this game is from a gameplay standpoint. Some of the worst navigation I've ever experienced.

After eight hours of trying to enjoy ""one of the best RPGs to ever exist"" I'm just so tired of how insanely terrible this game is to try to navigate and experience. Probably four hours of my gameplay have been spent running in circles and looking up guides on where the hell I'm supposed to go.

Mass Effect did [i]not[/i] withstand the test of time.

I have no idea what they remastered, because the game is exactly as I remember it from 2 decades ago. The Legendary Edition includes all DLCs, but I didn't see anything beyond the vanilla game after playing ~75% of ME1 (that's where I finally stopped, because I was beyond bored. I didn't even bother starting ME2 and 3). 

I remembered ME as having one of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game. After playing it again, I think it's a rather simple one rather poorly told. 

You make some choices here and there, yes, but they are binary and you don't have to wonder about their consequences, because the game immediately tells you the moral outcome of your pick by awarding you Paragon or Renegade points. So, your options are always the same: to do what the game considers ""good,"" or what it considers ""bad.""

Surveying planets is boring and pointless. Landing on them is much worse, because doing so takes you to a large empty area with a bumpy terrain that is quite annoying to navigate with your bouncy and weirdly-controlled 6-wheeler. If you bother exploring them thoroughly, all you'll find is money, a few sad items, and/or your worst nightmare: a copy-pasted location. And I'm not even talking about some nice, complex place; no, I'm talking about a few interconnected square rooms filled with nothing but boxes -- and always the same 5 or so different boxes, because these are pretty much all the props available in the game.

Combat is dull, consisting in your weapon overheating while you fire at bullet-sponges that move illogically. Having 2 squad mates joining you in battle is cool, but they act stupidly and frequently get in your way.

Your characters have skill trees, but these are boring and uninspired. Also, you get a ton of skill points, likely enough to get 100% of skills on everyone (no strategic building required whatsoever). 

Items are dull as well. Weapons' stats consist in variations of damage/heat-sink/accuracy, armors' in variations of defence/shield/biotic or tech defence. That's all. The only interesting thing about items is that weapons and armors have slots in which you can install some mods, adding bonuses to them. That's nice, but the mods themselves are nearly as uninspired as everything else in the game.

All maps are small, all spaces tight, everything linear. The game's level design is the worst and laziest I think I've ever seen.

To wrap it all in a paper bag and set it on fire on your porch, Mass Effect requires EA's platform to be installed on your computer, and for it to run every time you start the game. After it just refused to open twice in a row as I was about to force myself to play the game for a few more minutes, I finally gave up on it. 

In short, ME is terribly [i]dated[/i]. I thought it was a classic, but no -- it was just once good, in a time when there was simply nothing better. All the charm it had when initially released is gone. Now, it's just an embarrassing example of how awful [i]everything[/i] in games was 20 years ago. 

I loved this thing back in the day, and just gave the series a second, honest shot. But nostalgia alone can't save it. Mass Effect is now as boring as hell to old timers, and probably downright unplayable to newcomers. Even remastered, with all DLCs and a 90% discount, it's not worth playing -- not even for the story, which is what I personally went in for.",False,3,1,1762268317,N/A,Steam

In those sixteen years, I’ve graduated from university and climbed to a high corporate position — yet the core game mechanics still feel stuck in the embryonic state of 2009...

I do like the fact that the gameplay is slow-paced. In fact, that slow pacing often helps the sluggish allied AI make fewer mistakes and avoid getting in the way.
But sometimes their behavior is just absurd… On the map with the amusement park, I was clearing an LZ full of heavily armed enemies, carefully peeking around the corner of a small building. AI “Fire” and “Assist” were covering the rear — everything was going great and felt very immersive. But “Ready,” who was originally behind me, decided to run all the way around the building toward the enemy side and almost took a bullet to the face from me as he appeared right in my line of fire. Pure nonsense.

The enemy AI would honestly fit much better in a zombie game. In the post-mission statistics, we often see numbers like 35–80 kills. With AI like this, that’s the only way to make the game challenging. But wouldn’t “quality over quantity” be better? Ten smart enemies are far more interesting than fifty zombies.

The random generation of buildings is great — it adds variety to repeated playthroughs. But the environments are completely empty. No civilians, no traffic, no security cordons or background activity that could make the world feel alive. Is it really that hard to add? Does it make sense that for an operation to clear an insurgents stronghold, only four men and an APC are deployed — and within a 500-meter radius, there’s not a single allied unit securing the perimeter or sweeping nearby streets outside the playable zone?

It’s truly sad that the development is progressing so slowly that I no longer believe in a bright future for this game.

The gun play is very stale, the procedural generation is cool, but more of a gimmick then an actual factor to your game play. Once you see the same house 10 times, you understand the layouts and interiors which remove any ""unknowing"" factor when entering these structures. The devs stay radio silent, and this whole year 2025 they've talked about this big Autumn update, but no preview or any kinda teaser as to what it really is besides Dev Blogs with big flashy words that just fill me with more dispair then anything. Many in the community, myself included believe the devs have abandoned this game and just simply made off with the money. 

The Single-player campaign is nowhere near finished, the cut scenes feel rushed and half baked, as do almost all other sysyems in the game. This should game with a ""buyer beware"" tag, I hope that the devs finish the game and make it the shooter they set out to develop. But at this point in time I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone, when other games do it better, just not in the Middle East with a historical setting.

Monster Train,1548850,25.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Early Access",76561198117738808,"So I want to like this game because this era was all the pictures, propaganda, gear, and training standards when I joined the Marines. I came in shortly after Fallujah. But I just cannot like it, it is a poorly executed shooter, and the mechanics in game still leave so much to be desired. I bought it, hated it, gave it like a year to develop, still hate it.

Point shooting mechanic- I understand what they are going for, because when I first was trained in CQB, I was taught this exact thing. Look just over top of your rear sight, and put the target between the wings of the front sight, and out to about 50 yards, that's accurate enough to do the job. I shot probably thousands of rounds thru M16s at close range just like this before Acogs and Dots became the standard. But in the game the impact point is wayyyyyyy too high, Like several feet high at across the street distance. Theres no real predictability to it and even in rooms where you should be able to use your flashlight as a pointer, its way above that. Think about that logically, flashlight mounted maybe 2 inches on the right side of the barrels center line, and the impact hits like a torso distance above the center of the light beam at room distance. That don't make sense in any religion on any planet. 

The AI are dumber than actual Marines, and that's a feat. We eat crayons and marry strippers we meet right off base named Kandi. But the team mates in game are even worse. They will rush in directly front of you as you are shooting the enemy, get shot in the process, you stop shooting so you dont kill them, then you both get mowed down by the guy you weren't able to kill because Lance Corporal retard got in the way. They also get stuck on the simplest of obstacles and sometimes shoot you in the back of the head to try to kill the guy in front of you since you made entry into the room first but they want the kill I guess. 

The command system is also lackluster at best, you basically have go here, come here, suppress, watch over there, and a variety of object/instance specific tasks like breach a door or plant c4 right, but the go here command is capped at a very close distance. Like 25 yards. So you're trying to cover your team as they advance up the road since you got the acog and theres bad guys up the street, but you cant order them to a piece of cover because its 40 yards away and that's just too far away. That's not even in the distance we would start using our radios in combat. Theres also no combat formations whatsoever, they just kind of stumble bum around in whatever order they feel like, but usually in a straight line close enough to hold each others pockets, looking whatever direction they feel like, oblivious to the world around them until they get shot at, and if you tell them to go to a piece of cover, but then tell them to watch in a direction, they will leave that cover and stand in the open to watch that direction, getting shot and killed.

As a concept, I love Six Days in Fallujah. It was pretty good before the addition of the campaign mode. I don't know what changed, but before, I was able to play on ""High"" graphics settings, now I have to play at the lowest settings to get a more playable experience.
As for the gameplay, the friendly AI can't hit a thing to save their life, or mine. I've been incapacitated by the door to the AAV after calling reinforcements. My whole fire team has been blown up by only God knows what less than 20 seconds into a mission. And the stupid tank escort mission, holy hell. The friendly AI is absolutely useless in shooting anything that is even remotely behind cover, the enemy AI is pixel peeking and blowing up the tank with RPGs, getting stuck, and appearing out of thin air, I have watched them spawn right in front of me. There is nothing more frustrating about a game than dying the same way or failing a mission the same way dozens of times. Call it a skill issue, but if there's no indication for what I'm supposed to do other than walk forward, mark IEDs, and shoot bad guys that I can't see, how the hell am I supposed to learn if I keep getting turned into a pink mist?

The immersion is incredibly meh for the price point, especially considering it's in early access. The AI are not very smart at all, they'll follow you into rooms and run in front of your gun while you're shooting. They're just a pain to coordinate all around and I wish you could still play with them off. 

The visuals aren't great, some places are very dark and some places don't fit the overall atmosphere. 
It's incredibly difficult to tell where you're getting shot from as the background includes muzzle flash and tracers travelling towards you yet there are no enemies. 

The game features a point fire mechanic, which is heavily encouraged but makes the game feel incredibly arcade like, putting a crosshair on your screen. It honestly breaks the immersion, point firing itself is fine, but is the crosshair really necessary?

This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the incredibly zoomed in irons they give you. They take up half your screen and are virtually impossible to use in cqc. It just makes using irons completely irrelevant for the first few missions and you don't even get to choose which attachments you want to run for the first two missions at least. 

Did I mention the tips halfway through missions that feel more like cutscenes? Halfway through the first mission, the game slows down everything and tells you to place an order for your squadmates to watch a balcony, which seems fine at first considering its the starting mission. This wouldn't be an issue, except that it happens halfway through missions and DURING firefights. Getting randomly put in slow motion, and moving your characters gun barrel towards the floor since you apparently need to radio to command while you're being shot at just completely ruins the flow of the gameplay. I cannot speak for the entire game though, as I only played the first two missions before refunding, so I seriously hope there's a way to turn this off or that it becomes significantly less common as you progress. 

The game itself just feels incredibly arcade like for what it advertises itself as. It might get better with time seeing as it is in early access but I simply cannot recommend it in its current state considering its price point. 

I would heavily recommend waiting for future updates and the full release before purchasing, despite all the positive reviews. These issues seriously break the immersion and disrupt the flow of gameplay. I hope this game can find a way to become more immersive and more realistic while balancing the amount of guidance the player actually needs. There's lots of potential here, and I will revisit this game upon full release.

However on sale for $25 its not a bad game to play with friends. With that said. Ive found guns to have random aim bloom that doesnt make sense even with first shots or crouching firing super slow. The acog is off zero and does not hit where you are aiming about 80% of the time. Additionally AI will just spawn and or appear in front of your or at your feet literally on defense missions. Friendly AI commanding on multiplayer are disabled this includes telling them to hold or move (horrible decision). So they will do nothing except revive and occasionally shoot at enemies while holding your hand and blocking your vision or movement whenever they possibly can with their bodies or their flashlight (AI flashlight bloom or blinding should be disabled). You cannot not command them to do anything other than close tunnels. To which are often bugged and will trap enemies inside of them preventing you from completing missions. Graphically speaking it looks like it was downgraded as of late. Still looks decent but definitely not as good as it is in the trailers. AI spawning needs to be adjusted quite a bit. They should run from areas close to the edge of the map away from where the player has cleared. Or just away from where the player is coming from/spawning from.

I played the game for about 70 hours in my first 2 months after the release.
I got somewhat bored after that and I now returned and there is so MUCH new stuff to do, new areas, new material to build and craft with.
New weapon types and all that jazz, I really like the game and I really do recommend it, no matter if you play solo or with friends.

Playing with friends is ofc a bit more fun for the most part and can make certain things easier.
Speaking of easier, there is ONE boss in the game that makes my blood boil. The mechanics and battle arena is just all bad and the only good thing about the boss is the design of the boss itself, not the mechanics or the battle. I cheezed the hell out of that fight by dropping the damage and health of the boss down to 20%, I love being able to customize my worlds with difficulties and resource yields and all that.

There are plenty of kinks and bugs to work out but the developers are working on the game and it shows. I hope the full realization of the game will come into fruition with the 1.0 update at some point.",True,0,0,1764176694,N/A,Steam

The game is fun, and the concept is good, but some areas seem to be extremely confused in the direction and there is a definite lack of review on how the additional content fits into the gameplay.

The new fishing for example, I kept breaking my line on rare fish and it wasn't until I searched *spoilers* did I find out you only get access to additional rods from the newest, lvl ~40ish area. The introduced fishing minigame, which is pushed very early through the villagers, and you can only get better at what is currently end game. Who reviewed this idea? It only takes thinking about this briefly from a new player perspective to recognise this is a terrible implementation, this game is still an 'in development' game and thus should be catering to a growing playerbase, why is something implemented and introduced to new players but the only development to this gameplay concept is brought about in the late game?

Being early access and a multi-platform game, some things such as excessively limited keybinds is understandable, but why am I still falling through the map on Blackmire? I had these issues when I first explored Blackmire maybe a month after it came out? A long time ago. And I am *still* falling through the map in that area, getting sent back all the way from the *spoilers* shroud root in SE Blackmire after going all the way through that horrible maze.

Meanwhile, as far as something that has also not improved during this process, lock on and hit registration, especially using the jump slam attack (which may be new I do not remember it) are still crap, I hit things behind me more consistently than what is directly in front, and any lunge attacks that I sidestep hit me similarly in the back, so at least it's consistent that in this universe it is easiest to hit that which you cannot see.

From the lacklustre ""Story"" missions that don't do anything other than ""Go Here, kill that""
To the world feeling both full of things but lifeless at the same time.
The boring level grind because most things you do don't give any XP, and that horrendously large skill tree just taking me completely out of the fun of Progression.
Building, which should be the thing I like the most, I just can't enjoy it here, the building system looks both really good and really convoluted at the same time. Too many buttons, no decent build camera and constantly having to break the flow to get decorations from one place or building blocks from another because I can't just use the resources I've gathered to build directly isn't fun or engaging.
Combat feels like a chore, it's not engaging or rewarding, more often than not the Lock-On is more problematic than it should, enemies have a weird difficulty scaling where one is a total pushover and the next will deck you instantly.

The thing I was more interested in, the Shroud and the Fact you're supposed to cleanse it, is totally insignificant, because nothing on the world is permanently changed, the Shroud you clear just gets back after a while and no terrain or structure stays permanently destroyed, it's totally pointless to engage with the one thing this game could have different from the rest.

Maybe the game picks up after a while, maybe the things showed on the Store videos and screenshots give more life to the game, but I'm honestly not committed to play any more of the game, which is a real shame to me because I wanna like it, it has some nice features here and there, but I can't force myself to enjoy something I'm still on the fence about after 15 hours.",False,1,0,1764012858,N/A,Steam

As far as i'm concerned there are maybe 1 or two bosses that aren't _just_ tank & spank (minor mechanics). The other enemies are extremely boring and repetitive. The same enemies repeated over and over, just different skins basically.

I really think this game has potential, but as it is today i am disappointed in the lack of content and the way the team seems to avoid adding more traditional content.

As a player in a group, you'll always have someone do something and now that gameplay experience does not exist for the rest of the players. Settings don't seem to properly afford the players the means to fix issues and equally contain such a bulk of settings that the player would rather just play another game.

The last update also added frequent rain. When it's raining, you are wet. When you are wet, your stamina is reduced and so is your stamina regen. This has genuinely caused some of the most miserable experiences I've had with this game. In a game that already heavily punishes you using the stamina system, every bad experience you had before is now exponentially worsened. The stamina system as-is creates too many moments where the player has to stand in place for 1-5 minutes.

Also terrible is the lighting. Specifically, for all the gorgeous scenery, you can't actually see the game more often than not. There's the shroud fog which reduces vision, underwater now that reduces vision, foliage which reduces vision. When it's night, light sources don't illuminate very far. You end up standing still for jumping portions for up to 12 minutes. Some darkness applied to ground is indistinguishable from open pits, likely resulting in falling.

Speaking of falling, the player will do it a lot because the game decided a flat surface is sloped just wrong. The player will fall because the glider read collision on terrain that doesn't exist. The player will land and forcibly roll off a surface. The player will fall because instead of double-jumping, the game decides to pull out the glider. And when the player falls, they often will die.

When the player dies, they have to run to the last solid surface they were on, which sometimes is why they died or makes them repeat the same exact actions that caused them to die in the first place.

36 hours i made it, every night me and my duo got on was a night filled with why am i playing this,  surely it will get better but it just got worse over time.  

on the surface this game looks amazing, plays well enough and the world looks great but then you actually play the game and regret your choices.  

I really tried to like this game and i will start with its main positive which is the building system, you got terraforming and a lot of building pieces to pick from and can rebuild the broken down villages.  but that is the only positive i got.

The number one thing i noted playing this game was that it just hates the players... like dark souls but i love dark souls i have 300+ hours on dark souls 3.   this game actually just hates you... it wants you to get stuck, killed by hidden explosives, a swamp that insta kills you, monsters that hit for 500+ damage when you have a 480 health pool with the best armor you can get at the time and a vertical map that is cool at first but really is just a problem.  

I really hated this game the whole time i was playing it,  and im a survival craft player im not new to the genre.  i kept telling myself just give it more time but it just got worse the longer it went.  

This game sucked a lot and its a shame cause it looks good and obviously had good development dollars but this is a hard NO from me.

Neon White,1677740,0.0,0,multiplayer,"Action, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Racing, Free To Play",76561198169200767,"I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

Would I recommend it?

I'd like to mention the fact that I have no issues with the core gameplay of this Fall Guys clone. It plays smoothly and its everything you expect it to be. No, my issues are of a different kind.

First of all, I hate the fact that [i]Stumble Guys[/i] is [i]all[/i] about micro-transactions. You could make the argument that many other games have micro-transactions, sure, but what really bothers me is that you are [i]required[/i] to spend money on these stupid micro-transactions in order to get some of the achievements this game has.

Second of all, there are many achievements related to maps that no longer show up [i]at all[/i], or have an astronomically low chance of ever showing up. This locks anyone who wishes to fully complete the game (achievement wise) out.

Lastly, the currency you would get in this game by taking part in the mentioned micro-transactions is [i]way[/i] too overpriced.

Due to the fact that 1. I am not made of money and 2. the game isn't [i]THAT[/i] fun to excuse the micro-transactions, I am abandoning my achievement hunting for [i]Stumble Guys[/i]. Too bad. I would have really liked to put in the hours to complete it.

Spoiler: Der Spaß bleibt meistens auf der Strecke — zusammen mit meinem Charakter, der mal wieder von der Map geflogen ist, weil die Physik sich gedacht hat: „Heute nicht, Bruder.“

Erstmal das Offensichtliche: Das Spiel fühlt sich an, als wär’s auf Speed gebaut und dann dreimal zurückportiert worden. Alles wackelt, rutscht, buggt, und du hast permanent das Gefühl, die Steuerung ist aus Gummi. Präzision? Fehlanzeige. Dein Charakter läuft, als würde er auf Butter gleiten.

Dann der Ping – der eigentliche Endgegner in Stumble Guys. Egal wie gut du spielst, am Ende gewinnst du nicht, weil du skill hast, sondern weil der Server Gnade zeigt. Du springst perfekt – und wirst trotzdem nach hinten teleportiert. Du rutschst auf einer glatten Fläche aus, auf der eigentlich nichts ist. Und manchmal wirst du einfach so eliminiert, ohne dass du weißt, was du falsch gemacht hast.

Der Content? Wenn du drei Runden gespielt hast, hast du 90 % des Spiels gesehen. Immer dieselben Maps, dieselben Fallen, dieselben Zufallsmechaniken. Es ist nicht mal mehr frustrierend – nur noch ermüdend.

Klar, es gibt neue Skins. Jede Woche. Jede verdammte Woche. Und natürlich stecken sie hinter Paywalls, Season Pässen oder irgendwelchen Glücksspiel-Kisten.

Stumble Guys ist im Prinzip:

10 % Spaß

20 % Frust

70 % Werbung, Pop-ups und „Kauf jetzt dieses Ultra-Legendary-Rainbow-Kitty-Paket für nur 19,99 €“


Ich will gar nicht wissen, wie viele Stunden meines Lebens ich damit verbracht habe, in der Lobby auf „Start“ zu drücken, während das Spiel mir fünf Mal sagt, ich soll mir ein „besonderes Angebot“ anschauen.

Ach ja, und dann kommt noch das absolute Highlight: Mobile Port auf PC.
Alles fühlt sich an, als wäre es nie für Maus und Tastatur gedacht gewesen. Die Menüs sind ein Desaster, das UI schreit Handyspiel, und manchmal erkennt das Spiel deine Eingaben einfach gar nicht.

Ich hab’s ehrlich versucht. Ich hab’s mit Freunden gespielt, ich hab’s solo gespielt, ich hab mir eingeredet, dass es ja „für zwischendurch“ ist. Aber irgendwann merkst du: Es gibt kein „zwischendurch“ – es gibt nur „wieder rausfliegen, wieder genervt Alt + F4“.

Nier Automata,524220,15.99,0,solo,"Action, RPG",76561198343874430,"Even though I haven’t played a huge amount of NieR: Automata, it’s already one of my favorite games ever. It’s rare for a game to pull me in so quickly, but NieR: Automata does it effortlessly with its atmosphere, music, and emotional weight. From the very first hour, it feels like you’re stepping into a world that’s beautiful, broken, and strangely human.

What stands out the most is the vibe — that unique mix of melancholy and hope that Yoko Taro somehow makes feel comforting. The soundtrack alone could carry the entire experience; it’s haunting in a way that stays with you long after you stop playing. And even with the little I’ve seen of the story, it’s clear that it’s something deeper than just an action RPG. Every character, every mission, every small detail seems to mean something.

The gameplay shifts constantly — one moment you’re in fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, the next you’re in a top-down shooter or a side-scrolling platformer — and somehow it all works together seamlessly. Even as someone who hasn’t gone through all the routes yet, I already feel the emotional connection people talk about.

It’s a game I know I’ll keep coming back to, and the fact that I already love it this much with so little time played says everything. NieR: Automata isn’t just a game — it’s a feeling, and it’s one that stays with you.",True,0,0,1764026933,N/A,Steam

Every frustration you have had in Cuphead is not here.
Battles feel like battles, movement and combat works no matter how the perspective is.

Why this game?
The main reason I picked this game up was that I was sick of slow-ass combat and the pathetic dodge-rolls in souls like games. Why should I not take a hit just because I roll on the ground?
I wanted a fast paced game like Sekiro but not the ridicolusnes of 1000 kills in mousu genre games like Dynasty Warriors.

Pros:
→ Small 2D Gunship battles like arcade games: 1943 and more.
→ Small 3D Terminator/Armored Core battles which are also very cool.
→ Many 3D levels turn into 2.5D and it's much more fun to play that way and it keeps changing very quickly.
→ I am barely 30mins into the game and I have already figured out so many ways of combat without the game actually telling me so.
→ Giant boss battles which are pretty good.
→ Loved the quick dodge, still have to figure out the combat, a lot of things to go.

Quirks/Cons:
→  Game can be saved after around 45mins of gameplay. Will be around 1 hour if you keep dying.

Having a sexy protagonist really hurt this game as everyone who shared stuff about this game focused on the naked female body which I dearly admire, but this game should have just put in the Fable-in game model and then people might have realized what a fucking cool game this is. That being said, I am not complaining about the model one bit because you will never notice what your protagonist is wearing because you will be focused on the battle at had.

One was during a simple-seeming escort quest I started at level 23 and immediately regretted when level 50 enemies showed up (on my second attempt the enemies weren't so high level, so I suppose it was just bad luck).
The second was having to travel to a certain story-relevant location to progress a side-quest, but a short cutscene was automatically played that made the quest unavailable.

I dont even care anymore how good the story might be, because the underlying ""game"" you have to play (or much rather endure) to experience the story is so absurdly frustrating.

The reasons are:
- no autosaves, saving only works at fast travel points which entices you to not travel through the map on foot but rather hug the fast travel points to not lose hours of playtime if you mess something up and want to restart at a save
- you have to find your corpse if you die to recover some of your items
- the map is terrible, questmarkers and points of interest are all in the same color and all of them are visible at all times. finding what you are looking for is almost impossible
- the camera sucks. there are tons of areas where the camera switches from regular third person to one fixed angle like in the first resident evil games from almost 30 years ago
- the music will grind your gears after a few hours, because its not an atmospheric backgrund track. Its really obtrusive and there are lots of repetitive vocals that get annoying really quick

And a gameplay-unrelated bonus point are the (for a 2017 released game) ugly, sometimes borderline pis*filter looking graphics with lod issues, pop in and flickering foilage.

I have heard great things about this supposed masterpiece, however the reality did not meet the expectations. The switching between shoot 'em up/hack 'n' slash/platforming is novel but the pacing of the game is terrible. It absolutely does not respect your time, expects you to constantly backtrack and play the game multiple times. When it comes to the story or lore almost nothing is told to the player and you have to very slowly unravel things through tidbits in the world. 
My recommendation would be to watch the cutscenes on YouTube or better yet, watch the anime series that is based on the game, you will have infinitely better time.

i rarely write negative reviews, but nuclear throne is truly one of my favorites. it's like a zen state. every run is so intense yet *so* relaxing. the first 20 hours are an unforgiving learning process, but this is a necessary sacrifice in order to truly appreciate what comes afterwards.

nuclear throne avoids the problems of many other roguelikes, where you're doomed if your items aren't good enough or you get swarmed by enemies in the wrong way. this game is fine-tuned so that you can ALWAYS theoretically win a run, if you know what you're doing. it is the epitome of tough but fair. it should be frustrating but it isn't, because at the end of the day, *every single mistake* is your fault. (okay, that was a lie, a few of the achievements are just brutal. but it's about the journey, not the destination!)

true, sometimes the deaths feel like BS, and sometimes they even are. but it's a learning process. for example, getting suddenly blown up for all of your health is pretty funny -- and more importantly, it's a lesson to respect the power of grenade launchers (and stage props!). even the most explicitly unfair obstacles, like certain boss attacks, can be avoided with practice or planning. the end result of this mountain of failures, is a very satisfying flow state that tests your reflexes and tactical planning.  this is doubly true of the ""endgame"" system, which is a lot of fun if you can pay attention to all of the chaos. even now I am finding dumb ways to die, some really dumb ways to die.

overall, it's awesome for 15- or 30-minute study breaks. definitely a unique and interesting vibe, maybe slightly annoying at times, but it's grown on me. for example, i wasn't a huge fan of the soundtrack but you can easily go in the game files and swap it out with, say, the hotline miami music. great time, solid recommend. it should be even better when they release the epilogue update with custom difficulty & more character-specific achievements.",True,9,0,1760980057,N/A,Steam

While it does offer a decent variety of characters, weapons, enemies and levels, you'll probably have seen most of it within 2 hours.

I've pretty much found the same weapons every run. There's a variety of solid shot, energy and explosive weapons, like grenade launchers, rocket launchers, SMGs, laser pistols, crossbows, etc.

Characters are unlocked by just reaching certain levels it seems, and they're decently different, but I found that most of them are just ""even harder mode"". Not having access to the dodge roll or the even better block ability just doesn't seem particularly viable, unless you're so hardcore you're corehard.

Levels are always the same with minor variations. There's a specific set list you go through in each run, but there can be some differences at some points. Enemies are level-dependent, and every level is a sort of ""maze"" structure.

The mutations, aka level-ups, aren't interesting, either. They probably get a bit more complex, once you unlock more characters, since it seems the game is pulling them from each one of them, but I doubt that you'll deviate much from ""this is the best I can have"".

Now, my real issue (yeeeeah, git gud, scrub, I don't care) comes from the fact that the game is simply brutally unforgiving and unfair. Enemies do an absurd amount of damage to you, and your health pool is so small, I wonder why they even bothered with health pickups, since come level 3 or so all it takes is like 2 to 3 hits to go from full health to 0 health.
This is, obviously, exacerbated with each succeeding level, meaning you'll literally get one-shot, so health pickups worth 2 health are pointless if you simply die in 1 hit.

Of course, the game also evolves into a literal bullet hell, often dropping you into the middle of an unwinnable fire fight right from the start of a level, with enemies all around you shooting endlessly. Frantic doesn't even describe it.

All in all I can't find anything special about Nuclear Throne. Neither the setting, nor the weapons, nor the game mechanics are anything to write home about. It's simply a game for masochists, which is FINE ... it's just important that you know what you're getting yourself into, hence the ""not recommended"". It really is only for a VERY niche audience of which I am apparently not a part of.
If your idea of fun is to rerun the same 2 to 3 levels with basically the same setup over and over again in the vain hopes of maybe reaching level 4 or 5 at some point, without ever getting stronger or unlocking new equipment, and if you love twitch reaction top down shooters with very rough pixel art, then this game is for you.

The cherry on top being once you finally figure out all the things that will instantly kill you and make it to the final boss. Guess what? It instantly kills you, no warning, no reaction time, the only way to avoid it, is to die to it and learn that you have to be standing in a certain spot.

WHILE I WANT TO reccomend this game, i simply cannot after 460 hrs of gameplay i find its gameplay loop too difficult and challenging for what should be an easy to slide into casual game that you can play for a few minutes. 
 There are a lot of good things to be said and a lot of bad.
                          The BAD
I find the RNG to be frustrating in the worst way possible
Say you get blood lust mutation, Youd expect it to heal you like it says it will but it doesnt
its like its up to the game to decide whether the hit you made is going to heal you, it doesnt seem like a percent chance but rather it feels like it actively chooses whether or not youll get hp, sometimes ill get 3 hp in a row, other times i will go through 3 levels and receive nothing at all,

In most cases The game is fighting you at every turn. if you are doing good or you have good perks it seems like it tries even harder to make you fail. Like a racing game where the better you race, the better your rivals race, instead of expecting consistency  expect it to be harder as you get better.

Lack of defined rules .
You learn in this game by failing, and in some cases it seems like its silly. one type of enemy hurts to touch while others you can walk into with no damage being taken, none of this is explained before hand but rather through experience.  i guess consulting the wiki is mandatory for knowing what to do in this game. Rats and maggots and crystal crawlers ( like rats) are the bane of my existence, small, slow or agile and jumping or racing all over the screen able to hit  and walk away or the pretending to be dead guys who can also race around and knock u half dead in one shot.  everything seems to be better than you or able to easily dish out more damage than you can to them.  some things die in one shot depending on your weapon. 

its frustrating to even get to the the throne, the quarters are tight for gunplay, areas are too narrow for it, and in most cases enemies cant be fought with melee weapons ( if you get one)  because they explode, have better melee range than you, are bullet hell producing gigantic healthbars or would burst you full of death before you could get in range. 

In short the enemies, The RNG, the environment and even the Game itself HATES you and does not want you to succeed in anyway Creating a frustrating end user experience only a machiavellian could love. 

                                    The good
The graphics and sound are great for what the game is going for and work for the aesthetic intended.
The controls are tight and responsive
The gunplay is fantastic
The variety of enemies and guns is Great (i only wish destiny would add more variety so it wasnt so god awfully boring) 
It gives you that feeling of "" just one more run "" 

If you don t mind dying- A lot 
You like the aesthetic
You want something you could play for few minutes or hours on end ( but make no real headway the downfall of all rogue like/lites IMO)  then maybe this game is for you,  but if you want something where u can save and get farther and stronger like an arpg then id look elsewhere.

NT is one of the earlier twin stick roguelikes containing the skeleton of the genre. The gunplay is fast paced, tough, and simple. Upgrades come in the form of mutations which vary by character, and each level is a minimal, tiny, blocky arena that can be expanded via explosions.

Gameplay is centred around the guns and character specific gimmicks. Survival is achieved by learning how to wield the different weapons without killing yourself and familiarising yourself with the different enemies, how they react to being shot, and how to dodge their projectiles. The small resolution and tight spaces combined with large explosions and enemy attacks provide most of the difficulty here.

I just finished my second playthrough of *Ori and the Will of the Wisps* and I’m still in awe. Everything about this game feels like it was crafted with pure love.

From the very first moment, the visuals absolutely floor you. The hand-painted art style is breathtaking — every layer of parallax, every glowing particle, every blade of grass swaying in the wind looks like a living painting. When you sprint across the glowing sands of the Wellspring or glide through the midnight-blue depths of Luma Pools with the water effects rippling around Ori, it’s genuinely jaw-dropping. This is one of the most beautiful games ever made, period.

The soundtrack? Moon Studios somehow topped the already legendary *Blind Forest* score. Gareth Coker’s music swells and crashes with your emotions — gentle piano in quiet moments, thunderous orchestral bursts during escapes, heartbreaking strings when the story hits you right in the chest. I still get chills every single time “A Stirring from the Ruins” kicks in.

Gameplay is buttery smooth and endlessly satisfying. The movement upgrades feel amazing — triple jump, bash, dash, burrow, glide, grapple… everything flows together so naturally that by the end you’re chaining abilities like a speedrunner even if you’re just playing casually. Combat is weighty and fun (the new spirit weapons feel great), and the chase sequences are some of the most intense, perfectly paced moments in any platformer ever.

And the story… oh man. Without spoiling anything, *Will of the Wisps* takes the simple fairy-tale vibe of the first game and gives it real emotional weight. The new characters (especially Ku and the supporting cast) are so endearing, and the ending left me quietly crying in the best way possible. It’s rare for a game to make me care this much about little glowing forest spirits.

Yes, there were a few minor launch bugs back in 2020, but on modern hardware (Xbox Series X, PC, or Switch now) it runs flawlessly. If you love Metroidvanias, platformers, beautiful art, or just games that respect your emotions, you owe it to yourself to play *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*. It’s not just one of the best Xbox exclusives — it’s one of the best games of the entire generation.

Only thing is that its a bit less quality in general but the combat feels a bit more advanced except physics based things.

The best campaigns are the main game's and the dlc Palace of Ice. The rest is just additional stuff like classes (Some classes are DLC locked. Yes pretty scummy.) and Lost Valley is something a bit meh for my liking.

Overall very good, took 150 hours to beat every campaign available in the game with all DLC. You can also play workshop Campaigns made by other people. While its less quality and clearly no voice acting in these ones it adds a lot of replayability.

Very impressive attention to detail regarding game mechanics related to dungeons/dragons adventuring, crafting, combat, terrain, strategy, storytelling, character creation and development. Vastly superior to baldurs gate 3, with the shallow exception of graphics - but these games when done well engage the imagination and graphics should never trump the rest (and the graphics aren't terrible). It reminds me of the first baldurs gate, and what I would imagine a proper continuation of that game to look like (updated to more current rule-sets).

We will not see the like of Baldur's Gate 3 for some time, but this one is serviceable. Solasta is more gritty. There is no multi-classing, and the main campaign is very stingy with loot. You have to make due without the more fantastical weapons and armor. A +1 item that you can actually use is considered good loot and will be used for a good part of the campaign. The best items are crafted in the main campaign and getting the recipe, correct faction requirements, and ingredients will take you half the game or more to put together.
The 2 DLCs that add new classes and races are straight up rip offs that should have been dropped for free. The full bundle is a good deal when on sale. You get all the races, classes, new dice, and 2 extra campaigns. I just finished the Palace of Ice DLC and it was great. Getting the loot thrown at you without worrying about factions and recipes was very satisfying after the main campaign.
I would recommend to pick this up mainly because the next Solasta coming out early '26 looks amazing. They are revamping the graphics, and making a slew of improvements.

The campaign’s difficulty is all over the place. Sometimes we’d snooze our way through encounters. Other times, it took my party several attempts to prevail against a room full of foes that could all dish out and eat more damage than our little four-hero crew. Each time we finally got past a particularly sketchy battle, it felt like favorable dice rolls were more of a determining factor than our collaborative strategizing. A bit of randomness might be a fun way to add unpredictability to role-playing scenarios in a real-life D&D session, but luck as a primary mechanic in combat often leads to the dissatisfying disruption of your best-laid plans. Solasta at its worst really exemplifies this. It also just feels bad when you end up wasting multiple long-awaited turns because your professional archer can’t seem to hit a big, lumbering orc.

As for the rest of the game, it’s almost endearing how janky Solasta is. The muddy graphics, generic placeholder UI, “stanced-up” cutscenes that have a small reserve of animations, and awkwardly generic fantasy dialogue had me convinced that the game was from the early 2000s or something. As a co-op game, Solasta was only engaging for a short time, and it’s a shame that my party and I lost interest as we all enjoy CRPGs. It’s an unfair comparison given the obvious difference in scale/budget, but Solasta is no Baldur’s Gate 3. Solasta’s bland story and forgettable characters make for an experience with a tiny fraction of the personality that’s available in many other narrative-focused turn-based fantasy games.

Do you like DnD 5, but wish it had less roleplay? This game might be for you. The story is barebone, the characters are shallow and you can't affect the world around you. As a combat simulator the game works fine. Even then it includes infuriating limitations and restrictions that ought to have been detected and removed in playtesting. Requiring an ""open"" hand for somatic components is frankly absurd. Being able to change equipped weapon only once per turn likewise. Sometimes spells disappear during casting without counterspell or other explanation. Many choices are locked as soon as they are pressed and require loading an earlier save or starting over. Mistake in leveling up? Get fcked! Attuned the wrong character to the item? Go back to bed or load up! Much of this I am willing to forgive. It is the first game for this studio. Atleast the game is functional. It is a good start, but the lack of experience is palpable.

Pros: Beautiful maps. Battlemaps have hazards and differences in elevation. Combat works pretty well once you learn to avoid the games autistic need to punish missclicks. Character creation allows for leveling up. Having a pool for created characters is cool overall. The story has few cool peaks like the theft of the crown. Crafting while traveling is cool.

Cons: Minimal story. Uninteresting characters. Few voice actors and some horrible performances. With only 2 male and female voices in character creation means one suffers having multiple characters with the same voice. Nobody likes counting rations, projectiles, weight limits etc. LET ME WALK THROUGH ALLIES, SWAP WEAPONS AND CAST SPELLS WHILE HOLDING A SHIELD FFS! Consider this: Enemy is far. I switch to using my bow. I am out of arrows. I can not refill my quiver, because I used my one free swap of gear to take out the bow. I also can not swap back to my melee weapon. 
Random encounters re-use the same 2-3 maps. Spell ares of effect are at times clunky and imprecise to place. Player is not afforded even the illusion of choice in the story. Many species and classes are locked behind DLC.

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561199879437005,"OMORI is my favourite game of all time, and I doubt this'll change.

I found OMORI in 2022 before it was taken off of XBOX, initially glancing over it at first, I decided to play it later on into the year. OMORI has easily been the most impactful piece of media to grace my life.

The story is incredible, easily the meatiest part of this story is locked behind a HUGE spoiler wall, which I won't go into to allow people to really sink their teeth into something they equally should and shouldn't...

OMORI's artstyle and soundtrack are both brilliant, both of which influencing my artwork and music tastes in their own beautiful ways. After getting a PC in July of 2025 I wanted to see this game again the most, and it was nowhere near as lacklustre. I'd argue it was better. The story doesn't erode, it grows on you and hits you REALLY hard regardless of how many times you brush the dust off of it's cover.

OMORI is, and likely always will be my favourite game of all time.",True,0,0,1764044316,N/A,Steam
Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561199723823227,"This game is one of the most amazing, marvelous and I can certainly say the best game I played in my entire life. The story is wonderful and gorgeous while the graphic and the animation are most artisticly piece I ever saw. This game is so underrated compared to pokemon ZA. I believe that this game should have won game of the year in 2020 and event. Even though there isn't a sequel I still think having no sequel is better then having a sequel because OmoCat intended this so we the ""players"" can imagine what the ending is after sunny tells his friend what happened during that day. This game is so fun, funny that I finished the main story of Omori in under 3 days. This was the best purchase that I made this entire year, so if you're thinking to buy the game but think that it's not worth it, well let me tell you it is so worth it compare to other big company games like Sega and Nintendo. This game changed my perspective of life and my friends. If I could erase my memories then I would and play this game again, thats how good the game is. I just wish that OmoCat would be more social in their social media but I'm still happy that I got to play the game and experience of what it's like to lose a loved one and how different people cope with that lost. I hope that a lot of people would know about this game so the fandom never dies. This game had me crying and laughing at different moments and thats really hard to do in a game. I love how the game teases how Mari died and how Sunny tries to fight with his inner self or Omori in this case and fights back. Now I know a lot of you won't read my comment but if there's somebody that didn't buy the game and is thinking about it, then buy Omori you won't regret it I promise you that. Overall score for this game is 9.8/10 and I know some of you are wondering why didn't you give the game a 10/10, well I'm playing Omori in a macbook so there is a lot of lag and a lot of times my Macbook just froze or didn't boot up the game so yeah thats why its a 9.8/10.

Characters: 11/10 I love every single one of them they all have such unique personalities that fit seamlessly with the gameplay mechanics. The artstyle is so creatively directed and it brings such a charm to every single NPC and enemy in the game.

Music: Heat. It's banger after banger, many of the songs went into playlists after finishing the game.

Story (For 95% of the game): Great, fantastic, engaging, heartwrenching, a story of loss, friendship, love, grief, pain, joy, and forgiveness. 

Story (For the final 5% of playtime): Makes me more annoyed/frustrated the more I think about it. I don't want to get too much into spoilers, but the writers made a creative decision that undercuts the entire pathos of the story, subverts the themes of depressive masking and emotional shutdowns in a completely negative way, and (in my opinion) completely ruins any and all attachment and emotional connection developed with three of the six main characters.

The final like, HOUR of this game makes me never want to play it again and it makes it impossible for me to recommend someone play in good faith, I think if the ""Twist"" in the story never happened, and instead the writers just played the story straight with what they already had going on, the game would've been so, so, SO much better. As it is, I'm not going to recommend you complete this game, reader. It is such a creatively beautiful and heartwrenching game that shoots itself in the foot trying to include a ""shocking twist"" that completely ruins the story in retrospect RIGHT as its about to cross the finish line.

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561198124407909,"[h1]A Test of Patience, Not Enjoyment[/h1]

[b]Contains Major Spoilers[/b]

This was actually my third time starting Omori from the beginning. This time, I pushed myself to finish it because, honestly, I never would have completed it if it were not for my dear friend [URL=https://steamcommunity.com/id/sudowesu] Sudowesu [/URL] ❤️. He recommended Omori to me and guided me through the whole game. We finished it in about 30 hours, but if I had played alone, it would have easily taken 40 or 50. He is also a legend for translating Omori into Turkish!

[h3]Story[/h3]

The story is mostly filler. About 90 percent of the game is filler, and only 10 percent is real story or lore. And most of that story is told at the very end, where it feels rushed and weak. Omori has a promising story and decent characters, but it screws up everything with endless fetch quests, villains that have nothing to do with the story, mindless puzzles and combat, and countless huge walls of text that have nothing to do with the main plot. Most of the dialogue is full of meaningless sentences; actually, it is safe to say they are pointless monologues since Omori never speaks.

I spent about 25 hours of my playtime with random villains and characters rather than with my actual friends, both in gameplay and story sections. The friends you travel with are very one-dimensional. In the real-world sections, there is a little more bonding, but those parts are small, and even there, the game gives filler quests. This made me completely disconnect from a story I was curious about and emotionally invested in at the beginning. I mean, how was I supposed to care about the plot twist at the end if we never knew about the victim or their relationship with us? Showing 20-30 photos is not how you bond players with a group of characters, or a certain very important one, as a matter of fact. The plot twist also makes no sense at all for two 12 year olds to pull off.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

The gameplay is repetitive and never changes. There is an emotion system that sounds interesting, but it is almost never used. Every fight feels exactly the same. I went through the entire game with the same combo and strategy, and it always worked. Battles become boring very quickly.

The game also feels like it tries to waste your time. It reaches a new level of evil in game design. Omocat does literally everything she can to extend the game's duration artificially. I wanted to experience a refined, high-quality story, with fun gameplay but Omocat does not respect the player's time. I have a life, Omocat! I cannot spend 25 hours with your meaningless filler quests that I already forgot. A story that could have been told in 5 hours is stretched into over 30 hours in Omori. Undertale, To the Moon, or Finding Paradise tell amazing stories in less time, creating quality and fun narrative experiences. Even Undertale lasts about 8-10 hours at most, and that's a game that reinvents itself almost every battle. Both the storytelling and gameplay are worse in Omori, yet it lasts about 4 to 5 times longer. Why could Omori not do the same?

[h3]Visuals and Music[/h3]

The game has a beautiful hand-drawn art style, but it makes up only about 10 percent of the visuals. The rest is just decent pixel art, which looks good, but nothing extraordinary. The game is in 4:3 for whatever reason, which feels more annoying than stylish. The music is good. There are a handful of great tracks, but that's it.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

The most important question when reviewing any game is: ""Is it fun?"" For me, the answer is an easy no! And when a game is not fun, it should at least have an amazing story to keep me interested for 30 hours, or a good story for 5 to 10 hours. Omori has neither. It is a filler quest simulator. The game does everything possible to waste your time in every way. If you have a life, do not play this game. If this were a visual novel, it definitely could have been better. But as a JRPG, it fails in gameplay, story, and game design. 

I checked positive reviews to see why people liked it, and I still stand by my opinion. I also checked negative reviews, and I was not alone. Omori just wasted my time, and I could have been playing another game instead. These guys called ""i omor"" and PeppermintBee mostly summarized what I think about the plot twists and the story details, so make sure to check their reviews as well if you are interested.

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561198140697868,"Almost a masterpiece, but fails in a few key ways that Im not gonna get into in a steam review. I would put a negative review for a few reasons but the soundtrack was banging and there were a few key moments that were pretty cool to me. The story, I can see the vision, theres a foundation here but they didnt capitalize on the right parts(maybe intentional?) but if it is intentional it was a bad choice. The last hour of the game at least on my route which was the good ending told more story than the other 20 hours of gameplay.

Two things this game does really good:
Keeping you guessing where the ACTUAL story is gonna go
Art and soundtrack

Things it does realllly bad:
pacing- MY GOD , dreamspace was sooooooo so so so so boring. Like unbelievably boring and I was considering dropping the game for the entire 5 hours but i kept looking at reddit posts ""naw bro its so peak its a masta piece keeping playing"" and so I did and dream world never got any  less boring but the bossfights were like puddles of water along my path in the endless desert that is headspace and so i finished the game.
the dream sections are inconsequential, boring, bland, generic holdsupspork undertale but worse, quirky fantasy worlds that youre stuck slogging through for hours to get to the actual story which takes place in the real world. The boss fights are cool but theres soo much time between them its painful.

Like i was groaning in pain whenever i got sent back there those areas are really horrible, if this game didnt have the praise it has I would not have bothered finishing them.

Besides that all the meat and the good parts of the story take place in real life which is like 1/6th of the game, and its weird because toward the end the blend the dream and real world sequences in a way which makes sense and has cohesiojn?????? WHY WERENT YOU DOING THIS THE FIRST 20 hours

THis game could be cut to 1/3rd of its length and be better for it

or better yet

THEY COULDBE USED ALL THAT TIME TO DEEPEN YOUR BONDS WITH THE CHARACTERS AND PUSH THE THEMES AND CONCEPTS FURTHER, like seriously, SPOILERS (on the bridge section of the good ending, there is more character buildiing and bonding imo done in that one hour than in the entire rest of the game, like the violin part made me shed tears esspecially on the SPOOILERS reveal that the earlier dream about drowining actually did happen) SERIOUSLY where was that kind of stuff the rest of the game. The dream world has a few more tie ins like that but they were small and there wasnt many of them ie (otherworld is othermart, dreamworld park is a mix of the hideout and real park,)

Anyway that was a rant, what else was baddd hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
idk its hard to sum it all up, its like generally everything is lacking in the story.

WHich is dissapointing because I see the vision, this COULD have been a masterpiece but its not. It falls short in a lot of key ways, and a lot of that is due to dream world DESTROYING the pacing of the story, and them leaving actual character development to the very short real world sections and photos or blurbs at picnics.

Idk theres so much to write, because again the story has  alot of really good ideas, and if steam had an option I'd give it  a meh.

If u like the art, and you like turn based rpgs youll PROBABLY? like this game. But its not the masterpiece people claim it to be and the story has problems, and honestly I think it wouild have been better presented as a manga or anime and youll see the problems when yoi=u play it.
ANd if you dont like anything the game shows you by the time youre an hour or so in you probably wont like it.

wasted potential/10

Also last thing, I BOUGHT THIS GAME THINKING IT WAS HORROR. its tagged horoor

yk HORROR LIKE OUTLAST or deadspace, but that tag is not accuracte at all
dont get this game expecting a scary horror game its not that and honestly really isnt much of a psych horror story either. So i was dumbfounded at the start of the game, what it really is is a story of 4 friends adventuring and later dealing with real life problems and emotions which isnt bad. Once i thought of it that way I started enjoying it more. BUt yeah definitely not a horror game in the slightest, the scariest it gets is like?? Idek how to describe it, like sonic.exe cursed game creepy, but nothing that would legitimately creep out anyone over the age of 10. The only genuinely ""horror"" part of the game is at the start when you anwer your door and open it a crack, that part was peak and actually gave me a jump without being a jumpscare. If the game blended that stuff with the other emotional stuff at the end of the game for all 20 hours it would probably be my favorite game ive ever played. Which like I said, wasted potential. But ALL IN ALL for an indie game they hit it out of the park for all its issues, I hope one day maybe they give this the full metal alchemist brotherhood treatment and revise the story to be more focused and fun to playthrough or turn it into a manga. AS a game tho, peak 1% of the time, mid 49% of the time and the last 50 is garbage. The foundational story is peak, but brought down by fluff filler and random bs and teasing the truth. ALso for reasons that are spoilers a few characters are hard to empathize with because of the nature of the story another con. Last;y. theres a bunch of missable content and some of it you need to do specific things to access. Which I might play through but idk these first 25 hours were filling enough and Idk if I wanna play through more of the same to get to like maybe another 5-10 hours of extra content that wont change the story much. not countting the other 7 or so endings, so yeah lotta bang for your buck but theres so much fluff it might be more bang than youre looking for.


EDIT: after playign games that are better than this I changed my review to negative. This game is bad, and fails to tell a meaningful story, and the gameplay fucking sucks, the wlal of text above this was recency bias and cope trying to believe this game could live up to the hype in any way. it does not, spend your time playing somethjing better, while the sttory had potential to tell a story about suicide or depression it does neither. Its a bad game, if you want a  peak game thats horror, play silent hill f or SOMA, both are masterpieces.

I loved the Lisa games, Undertale, Yume Nikki, etc, so its not like im just a hater for this kind of game. This is just bad.

Nigh unplayable, it has pokemon combat, including a completely pointless ""emotion"" rock paper scissors mechanic that mimics the way pokemon types work. It even has dozens upon dozens of random combat encounters, except this is not pokemon and you dont capture anything, so they're just filler meant to slow you down and force you to interface with a boring and poorly baked combat system that shouldnt be there in the first place. After my first attempt, i got so exhausted i stopped playing, and when i came back just to try to experience the plot, i enabled cheats, and still took 13h to complete this.
You could also call all the headspace sections of the story pointless filler as well, since they take forever, are not particularly well written or endearing and do not progress the plot in any way. Tho ig that is a blessing in disguise because the plot feels like its competing with itself to see what levels of edgy it can reach without following any coherent sort of thematic throughline. No idea flows into each other and the plot twist is so ridiculous that it makes me question my sanity. This game has deeply twisted ideas about what kinds of actions can be resolved and forgiven by just ""overcoming internal guilt"" and ""talking to your friends"".

Omori,1150690,19.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",76561198071477823,"I'm sorry this game is way too hard I have played many JRPGs over the years and I found chrono trigger to be a rage inducing mess at times, but at least that game had some sense of progression or progress. 

In this game, the second you get out of tutorial you go from tutorial enemies so easy you could give your arthritic 80 year old grandmother the keyboard and she'd have a good time playing it, to immedately being thrown enemies that do 15 damage to you when you only have 50HP. 

So you think ""oh I should use my items."" The problem is that the enemies in the vast forest give you next to no money or gold what so ever. I shouldn't even have to explain this, but in a normal RPG or JRPG you get curb stomped a bit, get some money for your troubles and then you buy more health potions and keep grinding until your the one doing the curb stomping. 

In this game, you level up and you don't feel like you do any more damage, you don't gain any money. And pretty soon you just want to give up. Top this off with no save points or rest areas and pretty soon your burned out. By the time I got to the second area, I was at this bridge and I walked across it and there was a globe and the game is like ""its the earth, do you want to distrub it?"" And I'm like ""sure we're only three hours into the game, how bad could this go?"" It did 50 damage and one shotted my party over and over again and again until I died. At this point I closed the game and uninstalled. 

Why would anyone in their right mind review this game positively? This is easily the most overated experience I have ever seen in a turn based RPG. It feels like the developer has never played a videogame ever and fails to understand basic concepts of game design. 

And yeah, maybe I'm supposed to be messing around with emotions more. But heres the thing, if I was actually using my skills, they cost so much MP that its absurd. The most basic abilities will cost 5mp, while an expensive skill will cost 13. You have around 20 to 40mp and again, its not like I can use juice boxes to restore my MP because enemies drop no freaking money.

After looking up some more info on the game, I learned that I have to go into my files and tweak some things in order to play through it again. But honestly, I don't feel any desire to.

I have played the game about as blind as one can, only knowing it has Niko, a dead world, and fourth wall screwery where it messes with your computer.
This game is trying its best to be a great game, and it has a lot of passion put into it.
It's not that good.
No aspect of the game is nearly as good as it should be to get the following it has.
In order of best to worst, the art direction. It's pretty good, actually. The environments are all neat, and there's a lot of cute scenes. Every character is adorable. Not much else to say.
Next, the music. Some people really like it. It was kind of repetitive after awhile, and I wouldn't listen to it casually, but it was ok.
I'll put gameplay here, despite it being the worst element, because this is something you should go into knowing it's not about the gameplay. It says it's a puzzle game, but it should be treated more like a visual novel. Most of the time, gameplay is walking around, picking up stuff, and combining it. Nothing crazy, but it's also all you do. The only puzzles I remember, I remember because they have an achievement attached to them. If you're impatient, you will be bored out of your mind. If you're even reading this, that shouldn't be a problem.


Spoilers for the narrative. If you ignore this review and play the game, don't read it. Even minor spoilers massively hurt this game due to its narrative focus, and as I see it it's already lacking enough.
[spoiler]I was going to write a whole essay, multiple paragraphs worth, about how I didn't find the characters interesting and how the narrative hinges on the characters being treated as people, with a whole breakdown on each main character and how they have very little to them, but frankly I am not a good enough writer to properly summarize all of that, so you're getting a shortened version. Still decently long though.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]The story and characters aren't very good. At the very least, none of it stuck out to me. Maybe this is because I already engage with a lot of media that has similar narrative and meta-narrative themes and ideas (which I think execute them better), like Undertale, Deltarune, Homestuck, Metal Gear Solid, or hell even Toy Story (I'm serious) but it just didn't really resonate with me. There's a lot of characters introduced, and only two of them are given any significant development. Every other character feels like the same kind of ""quirky pixel art indie rpg about depression"" writing (wonder why), so while some moments got some emotion out of me, it was very minor at best. Niko's character is basically that they are in over their head, and really should not be here, but will strive to help the world regardless because they grew attached to it and the people in it. This sounds nice, but this brief summary isn't abridging much, and that's kind of their character the whole time, with wavering levels of commitment. I can't talk about the main antagonist without massive spoilers, but I can say that they have the only intended emotional moment I actually responded to. Every other character is one note and forgettable. The lore is also very empty, though I may think this because I'm spoiled by lore heavy games and media. Unfortunately I can't expound on that without game ruining spoilers.[/spoiler]


In summary, this game is really mediocre. I can only recommend it if you want to understand references made by the Cult of Niko. It's possible I just didn't understand the story and characters, or that I just don't vibe with the story, but considering that games with similar themes and ideas end up as some of my favorites (Deltrarune being the biggest example) I rather doubt that.",False,7,1,1756694591,N/A,Steam

OneShot,420530,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",76561197990954950,"TL;DR:
❌ Not recommended, despite strong artistic intent.
✔️ Worth experiencing for indie fans and Niko enjoyers.
💔 Beautiful concept, lovable protagonist, but ultimately shallow gameplay and underdeveloped world.

Well, that will be a very painful negative review, that's for sure. 

If for every time I've played a game with a good concept but a bad game itself I had a dollar, I could probably afford a fancy cappuccino, but that's not the point. The point is, I, despite the negative review, would still recommend playing it for every indie enjoyer, just because it is already an established part of the modern «indie game as an art» paradigm, and I'm all in for it. First off, I absolutely adore Niko. I'm pretty sure that the entire game started from his art and a couple of concepts from the late game, just because they are the most striking parts. Second of all, you [i]can[/i] feel the developer's passion in it. And, sadly enough, that's about it.

Truth be told, I was pretty sure for, like, 85% of the playthrough that I would give this a thumbs up with several pages of «but»s. But (sorry for the «but» overload) it wasn't meant to be. After the playthrough and a thorough discussion with my wife that gave it the first oneshot™, I realized that I just can't. 

The main point is, as rough as it sounds, the developers fell short in almost every aspect of the game beyond the initial design document. 

The protagonist is adorable and sensitive, but he has no space for development. Yeah, he's a nice little boy, he loves his momma and her pancakes, and then… there's nothing. 

The world is pretty original, but it's just empty. About 80% of locations feel just incomplete, with the main gameplay loop feeling like wandering through the identical locations trying to identify which of the same ladders and passages were not explored yet. 

The NPCs are well-written, but their plots are disappointingly narrow and shallow. Come on, if I can't even interact a certain item with a certain NPC not for the purpose of progress but for the sheer lore, then how can I believe in the liveliness of the world? 

And the fourth-wall breaking? Yes, that’s what the game is all about, but it still manages to feel bland—Niko’s lines being the one clear exception. He’s the heart and soul of the experience.

The «point-and-click» aspect? This is a textbook example of «How to build a very easy ""Find necessary items"" game 101». Still, at the same time, it has some problems articulating the path to progress. This game is notably trying to be an easy game with a tough experience, but it somehow fails at both.

I'm aware that Oneshot is one of the first games to truly explore the «playing outside the game itself» concept, and it probably inspired a lot of great creators of such games. But aside from being a pioneer, Oneshot for me just can't find its place between just a good «digital fantasy» game and an experimental one and it is so sad. Because I can truly imagine the moment of revelation when developers had arts and concepts on their hands and were like «Okay, we are one step away from the masterpiece».

For me, the masterpiece never happened. But the game still earned a place in people’s hearts.

That wasn’t enough to make it great. But still—despite all of this—you’ve got another member of the Niko Enjoyers Club. I sincerely hope we do see the masterpiece one day.

Don’t do it for yourself.

OneShot,420530,9.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",76561198144714852,"it's certainly cute and ahead of its time (remember the original was from 2014) but the gimmick is severely underused and simply won't work well on some computers. In my case, the ______,exe didn't work as intended so I had to start a new instance in every room. DDLC+ treatment is nice for accessability here, but also takes from the Experience. (not to mention the paths will change drastically from PC to PC, mine were hidden in three different folders - Documents (which I don't even use), %APPDATA% (which was a hunch) and the steamapp commons. Made me delete the wrong savefiles in different combinations for at least 30 minutes. 
The story itself is fine. It's very predictable, this also goes for the gameplay where you simply can do no wrong in the puzzle sections, and if you miss a part of the map you'll run around like a freak clicking tiles. 
The seed couldn't be picked up in my case which was kinda weird but I let it pass, later I read apparently it's quite important for an ending. Uh, cool?
There is little interaction with the player at all, you don't have many choices. There is no fail condition. The original had that going for it, that you basically have to clear it in one go so it had to be simple. At this point, write a sequel or a spin-off, seriously. 
All in all it's a neat little walking simulator (nothing more, really) but I won't recommend it because it was advertised to me by some crazy people saying it would be another Undertale or DDLC, which both of those it absolutely failed to deliver. 
Also, most of the goddamn lore in the game is ultimately useless. There is zero reason to learn about all the different phosphors and creatures, behind many items I suspected branching paths or different outcomes only to get nothing. Nothing is optional except the goddamn seed. So your one shot ultimately boils down to ""do you trust the machine or not"", with the rest of the game being fluff.",False,4,2,1754249744,N/A,Steam

I gotta say the theme & horrors of SOMA regarding existantialist dread was a breath of fresh air.

This also happens to be my very first game from Frictional so I had zero expectation or biases from Amnesia. The monsters & feeling of isolation you get from playing this game is on a whole another level.

Spoilers for the themes and an integral twist in the game: [spoiler]""Native Americans used to think photographs would steal your soul."" It's not a cut and paste, it's a copy and paste. Would I create a copy of myself to live a better life? Yes. Would it really fucking suck to continue being the doomed version? Very much so, but it would make me feel better that there's a version of me out there that's getting another chance. I've always been a big supporter of the idea of transferring one's consciousness to a mechanical or virtual form in order to evade death, I just usually think of it as a transfer rather than a copy. That might just be idealistic thinking though due to the disconnect between biology and what might be capable with technology.[/spoiler]

> This is, without a doubt, the best horror game I have ever experienced in my entire life. <

-I went in knowing absolutely nothing. My brother just told me, “You HAVE to play this one because it's a MUST.” (He already went through this one before me) So I thought, “Why not give it a try”

And oh dear Lord… I was left speechless.


-During the first hour I was simply curious — “Let’s see what this is about.” But somewhere around the second hour, I realized this wasn’t just a game and I had no idea what was coming for me.
Part of me wanted to stop, because I felt so uneasy… but the more I pushed forward, the more the world swallowed me whole. The level design, the atmosphere, the dialogues, the way the characters are build, and—OH GOD—the way that the story is written.... It isn’t just good. It’s a masterpiece.

>  (Honestly, I wish I could buy the entire story as a book. I’d read it a hundred times.)  <

-This is the kind of game where you don’t want to skip anything. I wanted answers—what happened to the characters, what happened to humanity, what happened to the world… and why I was at the bottom of the ocean. My mind was overflowing with questions I desperately needed answered.

-And the way the story reveals itself…
It gives you nothing at the beginning. It throws you, confused and helpless, into one of the biggest underwater facilities right after that brain scan, and you’re forced to piece everything together on your own.
When it all finally started to make sense… I genuinely had goosebumps.

-And then… The fact that you are able to see the other Simon… the shivers I felt down my spine…



-But that ending…



-The emptiness that washed over me… the hollow, sinking feeling in my chest…
It left me numb in a way I didn’t expect. I just sat there, staring at the screen, trying to process everything..


And Simon..

I hope you’ll be safe down there... alone...

Oxenfree,282140,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199526916375,"SOMA is the one of the most fascinating games I've ever played. [spoiler] The enemy A.I. is a giant step-up from Amnesia's with intricacies that one doesn't usually notice right away (Akers is attracted by sound, Yoshida doesn't see as well if you turn the lights in a room off) that enhances the fear factor and sense of paranoia immensely (some of the monsters being able to open doors is really novel design choice) with movement, sound design, and behavior of the Yoshida especially making it the scariest encounter within the entire game. The only real *thing* I would confidently say is a flaw with the encounter design is that the Proxy opening doors without any appendages doesn't make any sense. The gameplay in general is a more refined iteration of the gameplay style Frictional is known for but without Dark Descent's inventory management, but I think its exclusion here is more justified than A Machine for Pigs because a sanity system wouldn't make much sense within the context of the setting, and you shouldn't need to refill your light vessel when the flashlight is literally a part of your body whereas your lantern in Pigs can be just be on forever (as long as you don't flash it on enemies, but they sometimes see you regardless so shrug), which also made the detail of your light flashing when enemies are nearby made more sense as a design choice here compared to Pigs since it's not a 1800s lantern, it's a part of a 22nd century cyborg body. The only real annoyance I have with the gameplay is the scuba-diving sections (after K8's gone), where it can get pretty irritating to navigate through the map while your flashlight is too dim enough to be useful in many occasions. The epitome of this is the leviathan with it grabbing me having to require me to recalibrate where I was at. What the gameplay lacks in mechanical complexity, it makes up for with immersing you into Pathos-II and the stories within it, with the game also taking advantage of the interactivity of the medium in not only what choices you make and to what degree it changes particular scenes (which, along with it's length, boosts replayability value) but allows the player to piece together what happened with each and every area (seeing Brandon Wan's corpse right after I killed a brain scan of him particularly stands out to me). [/spoiler]

Similarly, the narrative is some of the most compelling I've come across, [spoiler] straight from the core premise alone (these thoughts aren't as organized). Having Simon using his blackbox to hear the last moments of most of the crew within Pathos-II is fucking harrowing and is disturbing for both the player and Simon, yet it only reinforces Simon's optimism in the ARK rather than driving him to doom-and-gloom until both after he kills a copy of himself and that heartbreaking last scene. Sarah Lindwall's last scene is really great with it being in one respect the hardest while also one of the easier choices to make in the game, with her *wanting* to die making killing her more poignant as the last breath of humans emphasizing their capacity of choice. The choice of to kill the Simon in Omicron is beautifully built up, and I lost my shit over making such a morally complex choice. Catherine's roof speech is a banger scene with it masterfully captures the beauty and comfortability of nostalgia and how to live on when everything you know is long gone, which I'd imagine will only resonant more with age, all the more complemented by the haunting score. The WAU is fascinating to think about in how it is functionally similar to the ARK, yet it's a machine's attempt at it rather than man's, but it *seems* for the WAU's victims involved, they can be living a good *version* of their past life, like we briefly saw with Simon with Amy, and that makes the decision at the end to either eliminate the WAU or leave a fascinating choice to think about. [/spoiler] I'm going to be thinking about this game for a *long* time to come and will definitely be replaying it in the near future.",True,1,0,1763533635,N/A,Steam
Oxenfree,282140,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198007141455,"[h1]What Makes Someone “Human”?[/h1]

[i]From the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent comes SOMA, a sci-fi horror game set below the waves of the Atlantic ocean. Struggle to survive a hostile world that will make you question your very existence.[/i]

[h2]Story[/h2]
In SOMA, you play as Simon Jarrett, who wakes up in a mysterious underwater research facility called PATHOS-II after a traumatic accident in his past. As Simon explores the decaying, abandoned facility, he discovers that an experiment to preserve human consciousness has gone horribly wrong, leaving the station populated by strange, hostile creatures and sentient machines. Simon gradually uncovers the fate of the facility’s staff and the ethical dilemmas surrounding identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
SOMA is a first-person survival horror game. SOMA builds on the gameplay style of previous Frictional Games titles, like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, focusing on stealth, puzzle-solving, and immersion. Unlike earlier games, it downplays inventory management to put more emphasis on story and character development.

Players encounter a variety of creatures, each tied to the game’s themes, and must sneak, hide, or outrun them since there are no weapons to fight back. The game also provides a wealth of clues, such as notes and audio recordings, to build atmosphere and explain the story. Progress is made through exploration, puzzle-solving, and careful evasion, but failure to avoid monsters can lead to death.

[h2]Enemies & Bosses[/h2]
The enemies in SOMA include WAU-corrupted scientists and researchers, malfunctioning robots at PATHOS-II, and terrifying deep-sea creatures lurking in the Abyss. You’ll face a variety of foes, from slow or blind enemies to giant aquatic monsters. Unlike many games, SOMA doesn’t have traditional boss fights, keeping the focus on constant tension and survival rather than epic showdowns.

[h2]Environment & Scares[/h2]
The game is set in underwater research facility PATHOS-II in the late 21st century. The facility has fallen into disrepair after a catastrophic event. The stations are mostly linear, but occasionally you venture outside and traverse the ocean floor, which offers larger, more open areas. The environment is filled with computers and recordings that reveal a wealth of lore.

The horror is psychological and atmospheric rather than relying on constant jump scares. The setting—a decaying, flooded underwater facility—creates a sense of isolation and dread; it’s only you and the monsters. Encounters with enemies are tense because you are physically weak, and threats are often sudden or ambiguous.

[h2]Visual Design & Sound Design[/h2]
The game is undeniably beautiful. The underwater station’s design combines realistic industrial architecture—metal walkways, pipes, control panels—with derelict, decaying areas. Water damage, corrosion, and dim lighting make the environment feel abandoned and unsafe. Walking on the dark ocean floor amplifies the sense of isolation. Underwater, sounds are muffled, with the soft bubbling of water, and distant objects appear increasingly blurred, enhancing the eerie atmosphere.

Monsters are organic-mechanical hybrids with disturbing, asymmetrical forms that evoke both fear and pity. AI-controlled robots have humanoid shapes but uncanny movements, highlighting the game’s themes of consciousness and identity. The screen becomes distorted when you look at enemies, and the effect intensifies the closer they get.

[h2]Constructive Criticism[/h2]
I was a bit disappointed by the blind enemy’s AI. I tried throwing objects to lure it away, but it didn’t respond to the sounds at all.

While SOMA is a great game with clever puzzles, I couldn’t help but feel that there were perhaps too many of them, particularly those presented on computer screens.

I would have liked more gameplay mechanics, such as inventory management—similar to how Amnesia: The Dark Descent requires you to manage oil for your lantern.

[h2]The Verdict[/h2]
The best part about SOMA is the story, characters, and the philosophical questions it raises, like: What makes someone “human”? Can consciousness exist independently of the body? Are copies of a person’s mind still the same person? The narrative explores identity, consciousness, and what it means to be human. A central theme is whether consciousness can survive the death of the body, and the moral implications of transferring minds to machines. It’s a hell of a story, especially if you take your time, read the notes, listen to audio recordings, and just immerse yourself fully in the story and atmosphere. It’s so thought-provoking.

The horror and atmosphere are well-crafted, with disturbing monsters, but the environment, sense of isolation, and core themes of the game are often even more terrifying than the creatures themselves.

SOMA is an amazing game, no question, but the abundance of puzzles became a bit overwhelming for my taste. Combined with the occasional shortcomings of the enemy AI and the limited gameplay mechanics, these factors lowered the game’s rating for me.

First of all i tried to play and finish this game thrice, in my first try i went until our protagonist went into ocean floor and i got annoyed at how slow it made me move when i attempted to solve the underwater puzzle, while i was busy solving it i made a effort/reward calculation in my mind and decided to alt f4 since neither the plot, puzzles, characters, horror sections made it seem worth it.

After a few years i wondered if i was too harsh on the game and decided to give it a try once again restarting and deciding to be more patient this time, this time i lasted until another puzzle where i had to gain information from a guy stuck in a simulation, by changing enviorenments and voices. I got stuck in this puzzle got annoyed uninstalled, then decided to reinstall and decided to brute force it and i hated the solution.

After this part i said to myself 'Glad im done with this puzzle, now game will probably reward me with some horror sections or plot to reward me and i will be safe from puzzles for a while.' Well nope i walked less than a minute and there it is, another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle without any meaningful reward for my time.

I didn't get this game on the promises of it being a walking sim with constant boring and annoying puzzles that makes your game longer, i got it for the promises of a revolutinary sci-fi horror story. Now i will continue why it didn't deliver for me starting with horror:

-They made the enviorenment of the game take place under the ocean where some sites are connected with each other and it takes place approximately one hundred years later and they somehow managed to not make it scary in a horror sense, no really imagine this i suffer from megalophobia, thalassophobia, Megalohydrothalassophobia so practically the whole package but only fear i felt was game forcing me to take another detour to reach my objective(A mistake Alien Isolation also did) or getting bombarded with another puzzle. Monsters/enemies aren't scary, they are very slow and annoying most of the time, acting as speed bumps.

Now lets compare them with amnesia the dark descent, outlast and alien isolation.

-In amnesia dark descent, enemies arent scary physically but the buildup to them(house shaking, noises they make) how they feel like an unstoppable force once they notice you and how they throw furniture away from the force of their charge once they notice you, the fact that you aren't supposed to look at them makes them scary.
-In outlast the soundtrack when you are getting hunted, heavy breathing of chris walker, his chains, his large frame and speed, Trager's speed and the fact that you can't escape him stealthily so getting chased by him is unavoidable, everything about Eddie Gluskin makes the game scary.
-In alien Isolation the fact that xenemorph has a skill tree, and adapts to your playstyle to hunt you down makes it scary.

Soma's enemies are not scary, just boring bland and unimaginative speed bumps attempting to slow your progress down nothing more.

Now 'revolutionary sci-fi story aspect'. This dissapointed me too, this is highly objective and depending on the person but personally i don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the question of what is a human? Or what is conciousness? Is your amputated grandpa still human? What if we give him a plastic prosthetic? What if we make his whole arm cybernetic? What if we completely equip him with cybernetics and make him a cyborg? What if we upload his conciousness into a toaster or vacuum cleaner? Got bored with my questions? Good now you know how i feel towards philosophical questions like this. Will reaching a satisfactory answer about these questions give your life any more meaning? Will it make your life more benefical and enjoyable? Personally i don't think so. Continue working at your 9 to 5, flipping burgers, continue trying to find your soul mate despite the fact that you are pushing 40 or continue living under your parents until you reach there.

Another reason is sci-fi might be my most read genre in books and i read asimov, dan simmons, cixin liu, Expanse series, richard morgan, stanislaw lem etc. where concepts they came up with terrified me even more than this game despite them not trying at all.

For example: gradually noticing the planet you are on is alive like you, finding an abandoned spaceship on a never before explored planet during an emergency stop, humans colonizing different planets literally becoming aliens due to difference in their planets and their customs and laws, finding a planet inhabited by something completely different than humans and aliens we dreamed of, whole hyperion storyline, dark forest theory, richard morgan's sleeve concept and how hypothetically Putin, Epstein, Clintons, Trump etc. can become immortal by transferring their conciousness into other peoples bodies repeadetly and the fact that in the future capitalist world how the rich can even steal your body for themselves legally and illegally and how you are powerless to stop it etc.

I might have been amazed by soma's story if i didn't see stories similar to it and done better before, and it's not a bad story don't get me wrong, in fact i might have liked it more if they ramped up the horror aspect more and made playing the game more enjoyable, but they didn't so i didn't enjoy soma. It's fine if you enjoyed it, im not claiming my opinion is the objective truth like others, but claiming my review is funny or wrong because i didn't enjoy a game with mid plot with terrible gameplay revolutionary annoys me very much. You mfs remind me of kids who acted deep and mature because they blasted bohemian rhapsody and paint it black every chance they got in high school and felt superior because they didn't enjoy modern music like other normies.

Another complaint is Simon is very annoying and stupid (or maybe delusional not wanting to accept reality), probably intentionally since he is suffering from brain damage, not seeing what is in front of him the whole game. Or they made sure to hammer in the plot continously so that players can understand the story. Probably both.

And if i was in a situation like Simon i would be more focused on the fact that im completely stranded alone without any means of entertainment to pass the time rather than getting philosophical and argue with a person who suffers from the same problem as me.",False,0,0,1758275956,N/A,Steam

I'd say the strengths of this game are the atmosphere and design, the weaknesses navigation and, possibly controversial, the story. I have seen people praising this game for its story and saying they can't stop thinking about it and its ending. Well, for me, the idea is there but the story fell pretty flat and it didn't really impact me. Maybe also because I didn't find Simon enough of a convincing/interesting protagonist.
For me the game was picking up once you get to Theta and you encounter more enemies. But until then there was a lot of just walking around, not really knowing where to go and what to do and this was kind of frustrating and not very fun to play.  I guess it fits the theme of Simon waking up and being a bit lost but I almost quit the game because of it. That being said it is mainly a walking simulator with having to get random items and sections of hiding/running from/sneaking around monsters. One thing I liked about that is that you had to approach each monster with a different tactic.
Regarding the ending: [spoiler] I wish there was an option not to launch the ARK, just shut down the WAU and that's it because I'm not convinced it was the right decision. Sure, ""humanity"" lives on but actually you are just brain scans on a harddrive floating in space. I wouldn't call that living.

Oxenfree,282140,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198120831813,"I played this game checking every corner and interacting with everything possible to get the most out of the story. But it's just... weak? Like I get it, there is some interesting concepts down there but they aren't really used much. Am I supposed to enjoy spending ~8h walking a linear path and hiding from monsters due to couple interesting revelations in the story?

The game is advertised as a horror game but it has no horror elements. The most stressful part of the game was thinking how long it's going to take for some of walks to end so we could get to the next part of the game. The game is indeed atmospheric, the sounds and the environment gives you this deserted, scary place vibes but you have barely any agency against the monsters so that's kinda boring.

There are some enemies in the game that you can't interact with besides throwing things at them to gain their attention. They are just there for the atmosphere and horror but they were more frustrating than enjoyable because it did nothing but slow down the gameplay unnecessarily by forcing me to crawl, not run and WAIT for the monster to walk so I can go through where its blocking.

The *optional* lore bits you can access by interacting with data boxes or dead people slows down the game, forces you to stay close by (else they get canceled) and listen at the speed of them talking. You can't read or skip to next sentence at your own pace. You can do a lot of the unskippable dialogue while walking around and exploring but the game punishes you for daring to explore side content.

The core story concept is very cool and I would like to see a proper book or a movie around it. But this game isn't it. It's not worth the amount of walking. This game disrespects your time. I expected a powerful narrative from this game but I couldn't find it. The philosophical aspect of the game can be summed up into couple sentences and don't need all the 'backstory' bits the game throws at you. You don't really immerse into any of the characters, they are just another hook that are not explored enough. 

If you are into a walking simulator with scary elements and enough for the characters and the story to stay at the level of shallow plot hooks to connect areas and missions you move between and not expect real depth of story then you would enjoy it way more than me. If you expect a powerful story that will leave you awestruck after you finish the game, this isn't it.",False,1,0,1754831719,N/A,Steam
Oxenfree,282140,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198201649618,"The atmosphere is amazing, with great visuals and a truly excellent soundscape, the story is interesting but the gameplay just sucks at a few points which really brings this down.

Its a walking simulator where you have to spend ages waiting on the other side of a door as a monster goes past, to run out and grab some stupid component to solve a ""puzzle"", rinse and repeat.

The first few times are honestly very tense and scary....but then it just becomes dull.

When you stop being scared of the monster and wish it would just hurry up and move because you've got sh*t to do, the horror aspect is well and truly gone, and the game loses all interest.

What makes it worse is that the game makes no effort to explain what you're supposed to do or why, not even offering hints or enviromental cues as many games of this sort do - at one point I couldn't figure out why a vehicle wasn't moving given I'd gotten the power on, got the access codes, turned everything on and wanted to leave.

Turns out I had to sit in the command chair and that only then would a hidden screen pop down from the roof and allow me to leave.

This isn't a big deal on its own, but there's just so many of these annoying little issues that ruin the flow of the game and force you to waste 5 or 10 minutes being annoyed and trying to figure out how to progress and these completely trash the immersion, which is otherwise excellent, and really the best part of the game by far.

I feel like the developers should have just made a movie - it would have been a great horror film instead of a mediocre game.

Edit: I eventually used a walkthrough to help me skip the annoying 'wandering around figuring out what to do' problem, and then I had a much better time, and overall enjoyed the game (I'me leaving the review negative just because I feel I really shouldn't have needed to do this to enjoy the game).",False,4,2,1753474027,N/A,Steam

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Devour is easily one of the best co-op horror games I’ve played. The tension, atmosphere, and unpredictable gameplay keep you on edge from start to finish. Every map feels unique, every run feels different, and the jump scares never get old — even when you think you’re ready.

The game rewards teamwork, communication, and strategy. When things go wrong (and they will), the chaos is actually the fun part. Whether you’re running from demons, collecting objectives, or reviving teammates in panic, the adrenaline rush is unmatched.

The developers keep the game fresh with updates, new maps, and challenges, making it a title you can return to again and again. Smooth performance, creepy sound design, and smart difficulty scaling make Devour stand out from other indie horror games.

If you enjoy horror, teamwork, and intense moments that make your heart race, Devour is absolutely the best co-op horror game to pick up.

Right now this game has 7 maps, hopefully more to come, with 4 difficulties ranging from easy to nightmare. So there is something for everyone. Each map has similar gameplay which is burn/sacrifice 10 specific items but different enough for each map so the gameplay isn't stale or boring. Also it has a bunch of achievements to grind after you completed all of the maps if you're into that. I've seen some people complaining about jumpscare sound being too loud and I wish there is an option to lower just that sound a bit but you can also turn it off completely if it's bothering you.

It's best to play with friends since people come and go on this game with most players coming back to play the game again around new map release. Sometimes it's hard to find public lobbies, their official discord is decent place to find people to play with but not the best.

For the majority of the time, you’re not scared: you’re busy collecting items, burning or purifying objects, and coordinating with teammates. The gameplay focuses heavily on timing, organization, and communication rather than actual fear or atmosphere. Jump scares do happen, but they quickly lose impact once you understand that everything follows a predictable pattern.

Devour might offer brief moments of tension or adrenaline, but it’s far from what you’d expect from a true horror experience.

At the current state of the game, I would say it's a good game, but it's really not balanced at all..
(And the gameplay loop feels really repetitive after a short time.)

---

Maybe it's balanced for 4 player rounds, but like 2-player rounds are not fun as all after 6/7 sacrifices..

On ""Normal"", which should be the middle (but atm it feels like ""hard""), there are way too many mobs spawning, which costs too much UV flashlight, so you often can't save yourself.
Also, the possessed person of the map is too ""aggressive"" on normal mode.
Like, after 2-3 sacrifices they already need to be flashed 2-3 times.. so its basically just running away, waiting for the red eyes to fade away, flashing them again and hoping to not run into several minions, which is nearly impossible after 6/7+ sacrifices.

The game needs to be tuned down in those terms to be fun for solo or duo play.

I really like the idea of the game, and that the gameplay is slightly different per map, but atm I can't recommend the game for solo players or if you plan on playing with one friend.
Not everyone plans on playing always with 2-3 other friends, so I hope the game will be more balanced for solo and duo rounds at some point and maybe the gameplay will be more unique too, so not every round/try feels the same, as it does at the current state of the game. Even if the description states ""not every round feels the same"" .. it pretty much does. If you don't switch between the maps, the only difference is - that the items/offering points are at slightly other spawnpoints, depending on the map. Which doesn't really change how the gameplay feels.

The game still has a lot of potential, if some stuff gets changed/added and if it would be more balanced.
Will change the review, if the game gets more diversity in gameplay and more casual-friendly in terms of the difficulty.

(Some last note in terms of difficulty and balancing, it also could be a great option and solution if the game would get some kind of difficulty sliders, so we as the players can change ""every"" aspect (which would influence how much XP we get too) to our liking. This way hardcore-players could also change the difficulty to how they wanna play. As some example, it could get inspired by how the game ""Phasmophobia"" handles this kind of stuff.)",False,3,0,1761505156,N/A,Steam

Paladins,444090,0.0,0,multiplayer,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198169200767,"I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

Would I recommend it?
Yeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",True,3,0,1763539446,N/A,Steam

Is Paladins perfect? No. The matchmaking can be hit-or-miss, and balance patches sometimes feel like they were decided by throwing darts at a board. But when the gameplay clicks it’s genuinely some of the most fun I’ve had in a shooter.

For anyone wondering if Paladins is worth trying or returning to:
Yes. Absolutely.

It’s chaotic, stylish, surprisingly strategic, and still manages to be addictive after hundreds of hours. If you’re willing to embrace its quirks, you’ll find a game with a ton of depth and replayability.

All in all, I liked the gameplay. But disliked the ""free-to-play"" monetization. Every new character (non-free) they introduced was always OP, until they introduced a new character (again OP) and ""re-balanced"" the earlier one. You could usually pay for them with an exorbitant amount of in-game currency, or a fairly small sum of real-life money. So ""free-to-play"" became ""pay-to-win"".

I especially liked the character skill/attribute customization options, where you could build your character to your own play-style. There might not be overly many players online, anymore, but I would recommend trying this.

It had a good variety of maps, a large roster of unique champions with different abilities, and even a shop system where you could buy extra perks to improve your stats. The gameplay felt fast and dynamic - fights were happening all the time, yet it never felt overwhelming or chaotic.

The balance and anti-cheat existed, though not always in their best shape. Still, for a while, the game managed to stay alive, build its own community, and even have an esports scene. But as time went on, it stopped evolving. Players began complaining that the only updates were new skins, while major improvements were nowhere to be seen. The game had squeezed out everything it could from its audience - and decline followed.

It's not a bad game by any means, but today it's simply not worth your attention anymore.

Frankly, I want my effort and skill to matter, not just luck or who got stacked on my team.
Recent matchmaking changes have only made things worse. Matches feel even less fair than before, with the system regularly putting beginners against top-tier veterans, or grouping talent in ways that just don’t make sense. Sometimes I feel like the queue cares more about filling spots quickly than about actually creating competitive, fun games. All this randomness means I rarely enjoy ranked anymore, since I don’t get consistent, challenging matches with players on my level.

These 'pop ups' basically ruin the game for anyone who is an adult and not some Twitch chair gremlin micropener. The game loses any atmosphere it had and just feels clunky, cheap, and FOMO'ey.

this game is very interesting! it's plot-light, there are npc interactions you can find as you go around the world, but the main draw of this game is its HEAVY focus on builds. you can mix and match classes easily, and not only that, you can mix and match stat growths from classes. this doesn't affect tooooo much if you're just playing casually, but if you want to minmax this is absolutely the game for you. it felt like a slog for me a few times, but once i understood where to put my focus everything crystallized fairly well.

The exploration.

VERY mild spoiler ahead...

To me, it's hilariously fitting from a meta perspective that you can actually bypass some of the Demo's restrictions and delve further into the game than ""intended"" just by... exploring and platforming enough.

And a lot of the time it just makes me wonder
""What the fuck.""

The Final Fantasy Project Overhaul in particular outright skips the middle man and turns the game into a full-on FF gameplay-wise while adding various story elements and cameos that make it feel like a genuinely impressive fangame and love letter to the older FFs.

If that does appeal to you, then buy the game, because it does all of those things at a really high level.

The two complaints I have are somewhat minor:
1. The difficulty settings are easy, normal, and hard when they really should be normal, hard, and ""I hate myself"". Under the description for normal, there is an explanation that there won't be much grinding. That's not even close to true. the game is still quite punishing on normal, and one of the most common complaints I've seen is that the difficulty spikes are ridiculous. If the developer had just renamed easy to normal and so on (sparing a lot of people's pride, myself included), they could have avoided this entirely.
2. The map system sucks. It should just track the area the player has explored. Instead, the game gate-keeps this function needlessly. This is easily the worst part of the game, and the other biggest complaint I've seen. Without looking things up online, you'll spend A LOT of time wandering.

**WARNING BIT OF SPOILER**

While normally i'm a bit of a sucker for a story in my jrpg's., this one has none present, short, albeit funny dialogues here and there.

The gameplay of platforming and metroidvania as well as the jrpg with different classes / sub classes / wpns / gear / acc's / archive entry etc got me hooked!

Quintar breeding was a pain, but oh so worth for sequoia tree, got pretty close to the top with owl & salmon but wanted to die X.x, never again. Do not suggest unless you're into pain and rage, masochistic style.

Currently bulking for the 4 superboss in the depths, 1 down 3 to go.

There are assist options if you feel you need a bit of a break on certain aspects of the game.
Imo the 3 homepoints are a must. Others at your leisure, i find most stuff balanced as is.

The music is superb, really immersive.
The world is fun to uncover, and i know some of you, like me, will reach out for every corner of the map possible. 😁
Mini games are harsh at first, but becomes easier as it goes. Quintar breeding is money and time consuming.

There are ways to break and fast forward the games progression, as this is non-linear game.

If you like all of those, then this is a fantastic game, but you really have to be into all of them for the game to truly shine.

The combat is good, lots of different class combinations and interesting setups you can make. The game is very difficult by normal JRPG standards, but there are a plenty of ways to break the system. The game even has a preset system that lets you save specific setups so you can swap them easily.

The exploration is good, very open-ended and tons of little secrets to find. It can be a bit tedious to get around, as even with all of the teleport stones it can take a couple of minutes to get to where you need to go. None of the areas really stand out in terms of level design, but there are tons of skips and tricky jumps you can make to completely break the intended order of progression.

The platforming is, in my opinion, the weakest aspect. It's fine, for the most part, but there are way too many areas where one missed jump can set you back upwards of five minutes to get back and try again. Areas with platforms over spikes or water were the best, since there if you miss a jump at least it puts you back where fell from. Nothing stings worse than missing the final jump in a section and falling all the way back to the bottom.

Definitely worth it if you like all three of the genres it's blending. If any of those are a turn off for you, it's probably best to just skip this one.",True,1,0,1757975114,N/A,Steam

* I'm not interested in story or dialogue. The game has minimal both.
* I want combat to be interesting and not a grind. Here, it's similar to Slay the Spire in that it's almost a puzzle: The enemies broadcast their upcoming actions and you need to both plan and react accordingly, rather than just apply a broad strategy. (Sometimes the normal enemy encounters can feel a bit repetitive)
* Traversing the world is actually interesting, and only restricted by your movement/inventory rather than plot triggers.
* Skill trees and character customization are deep enough to be interesting, but simple enough to not warrant analysis paralysis.
* Effectively no decision is irreversible, and no missables. If you ever want to pivot to a different strategy it's always an option, and just requires light time and resources. And there's no sense of ""don't miss stealing an item from this boss""
* You feel you can liberally use items. There's no sense of ""save all your megalixers!""

Huge world and the exploration is awesome, nice music, some challenge but not too difficult

And was this made by 1 person??
Crazy



EDIT: I took a break and came back to finish the game. I will say that the level cap is unfortunate, because some of the end game bosses will still be quite difficult even when you've reached max level.

You can lower the difficulty, but it can't be increased after it has been lowered. Makes no sense to me and I'm stuck on easy now
Normal difficulty was fine for most of the game, but some of the later bosses feel pretty unfair


The worst part of the whole game, though, has to be the quintar racing/breeding. Not only because the racing is difficult and not very fun, but also because you need to breed a golden quintar to access at least 2 areas in game. And for that, you will need to win a LOT of races and spend a shit-ton of gold to feed your quintars which get hungry every 2 seconds. So then you might actually need to grind to get gold to feed your quintars, which is the absolute opposite of fun

The battle system and mechanics are definitely its highest selling point.  For many battles at your level (even mundane ones), it is very important to manage threat, apply buffs and debuffs, and review the turn order to see what attacks are coming out.  Every battle feels meaningful, and until you out-level enemies in the area, it can be very easy to screw up and have someone die or even wipe.  Status effects are VERY strong in this game, and they can effect bosses.  Sleeping or paralyzing a boss to set up for a series of attacks or buffs feels awesome, and applying debuffs that reduce physical or magical damage (or increase these types of damage against the boss) are paramount to success.  Battles feel like chess matches at times, and it is a very welcome change.

If you are a gamer that values the story above all, this game will not be the right fit for you.  While I find the story to be endearing, it is purposely left to feel very bare bones.  The game challenges the player to determine their experience, and interactions with NPCs generally reinforce that.

There are obvious parallels with the classes that are very similar to Final Fantasy, and tends to improve on those archetypes in unique ways.  The level of experimentation can be as simple as having a tank, a physical DPS, a magical DPS, and a healer.  OR you can really go down the rabbit hole and mix and match so many different things.  I have spent countless hours both in and outside of game theory-crafting party comps, and I have enjoyed every second of it.  In addition, there are also battles that  may require a specific skill or skills to either make a fight easier or completely negate certain mechanics, so definitely don't spend too much time attempting to completely master classes before swapping to a new one.

Stats are what you make of them, and are as involved as you want to be.  As you gain a level, the stat boosts you gain are determined by your current class.  While it is beneficial to have a party member adhere to a specific role, you really do not have to do this at all, and this can even be custom-tailored later on to suit your needs later on, so don't worry about it.

This game is very exploration heavy, with many jump puzzles and terrain puzzles.  If you get easily frustrated by this, you can help mitigate it by enabling the ""Auto-Jump"" option, which perfectly times a last second jump if you walk off any ledge.  I have found it to be very helpful in my new games, and definitely makes things a bit easier.  The game also really doesn't tell you where to go, but you are generally blocked from new areas through the addition of mounts, which allow you to clear gaps easier, jump higher, or swim.  

Money in the early and mid game is a little rough to come by, and maps suck away a lot of your extra cash as they tend to be pretty expensive.  Definitely be prepared to grind a bit if you need cash for better equipment or consumables.

And of course, if you're into mods, there are plenty for this game that improve the QoL if you don't enjoy the standard gameplay.

Overall, this game asks you a simple question:  do you want to go on an adventure?  And this game delivers, and gives you a great adventure.  If you love JRPGs, turn-based combat, and exploration, with an emphasis on gameplay over story, then this game is for you.",True,0,0,1756078378,N/A,Steam

Peglin,1637730,13.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198843237854,"I think the game i extremely solid but I do have a number of caveats
First, the combat is excellent. I feel like the rate at which you get new abilities, items and classes keeps things super fresh for most of the game. I recommend mastering as many classes as possible rather than trying to keep an optimal party all the time. There is a system where the levels you get in a class influence your characters stats, but you can respec that at any time (kind of makes me wonder why its a thing in the first place and they don't just let you choose what stats to level but this isn't really a problem). I guess my only other problem with the combat would be that some of the late game classes are pretty redundant like dervish or valkyrie, but thats a bit of a nitpick and probably adds variety in randomized runs.

Aside from great combat though, there's a few points of friction for me. I think the open world is mostly a missed opportunity. For most of the game its pretty cool climbing stuff where you can, but i felt less rewarded for exploring as my options expanded, I ended up going in the ""wrong"" direction a couple times, , thinking the game just had a massive difficulty spike, getting my ass kicked by random encounters, considered dropping the game entirely etc. I know this is a vastly different game but I would've loved if the world was more open and areas had scaling in order of when you entered them like in monster sanctuary, especially given the built in randomizer and seeming intent of challenge runs and replay value. Another massive point of frustration for me was the platforming. The isometric perspective makes it pretty tricky... at its best in the early game its a fun spacial puzzles figuring out what you can and cant reach, but later jump puzzles become a regular and irritating mainstay of areas and dungeons, culminating in the quintar side quest. the gist is its like chao garden but fast precise platforming (races) is mandatory to raising and breeding quintars. you need to win like at least a dozen races to breed the ultimate quintar needed to access a late game area. I really wouldnt mind something like this being tied to a minigame if it wasnt also super difficult. Its like if to catch mewtwo you had to perfect a song on guitar hero.
I think these things sound like nitpicks but combined with getting caught by random encounters sometimes It can be frustrating enough to make me need a break sometimes.

All in all, i would recommend this to fans of the team comp side of jrpg genre. Theres some really fantastic design put into the core gameplay, but decisions elsewhere can bring it down. I think anybody who loves that older generation of rpgs probably has patience for a bit of weird annoying bs in their games though, so fire away. oh and fair warning the game barely has a plot. fine by me but dont expect to fall in love with any characters",True,0,0,1755656918,N/A,Steam
Peglin,1637730,13.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198026913057,"Definitely an interesting game that scratches a lot of little itches that no other game really has in a really long time. In short, if you're yearning for a complex job system and love finding secrets and unlockables in a classic RPG setting then this game is right up your alley and you should give it a shot.

[h3]Job system[/h3]
To get more into it this game has a complex, but not overwhelming, job system that adds a lot of customization for how you build your team. It's just robust enough to feel like you might be able to break the game with the right strategies and, in some cases, you kind of can. You begin the game with a party of four that you can level and gear up like any other good RPG. In this game you can choose each member's job and also a subjob. Jobs come with their own innate passives but when you choose a subjob you get access to that job's abilities and spells. You also level up the main job you have equipped and unlock more passives and abilities, making that job a more viable subjob for the future. An issue I have with this is how quickly some jobs get outclassed. Once one is mastered you'll never find a need to switch to that class ever again, forced to spend the rest of the game as a subjob. Classes like white mage are practically useless given their equipment limitations and underwhelming innate passive. If more classes had gameplay changing passives like the reaper then I feel like this could be mitigated. This is far from a deal breaker but it is a little disappointing once you get to the midgame point and start realizing your toolbox isn't as robust as initially thought.

[h3]Exploration[/h3]
This is a mixed bag because, for the most part, I very much enjoyed exploring the world and finding tons of secrets. There's hordes of hidden treasures and even jobs out there for you to find, making exploration feel very rewarding. The world is open to you and more of it becomes accessible as you're given new mounts to traverse the land with. Do yourself a favor and assign your mount's summoning item to the quick menu. Going through menus to use that item every single time you want to summon your mount feels exhausting even from the quick menu and it only gets worse as you unlock more. It wouldn't feel so bad if the parkour in this game wasn't so heinous which I'll get to in a second don't you worry. Some areas require you to switch between multiple mounts constantly and one slip and you have to do it all over again. Though your patience is almost always rewarded, it certainly does feel like a slog sometimes. If you're not thorough you can miss jobs entirely which I actually kind of like. It feels like a huge incentive to go out there and look around when the rewards are THAT good.

[h3]The Parkour[/h3]
I want to have a little chat with whatever Roblox or Minecraft kid convinced everyone that parkour is fun. I just wanna have a talk. Is it me? Am I just not the target audience? I play games like this because I love my menu-slop and I'm not afraid to admit that. I do NOT play these games to do jumping puzzles. They feel lazy, make the dungeons look god awful, and feel so out of place in an RPG. A few would've been fine but you're going to get to The Tree and think back to this review. I would've vastly preferred a far more simple [i]collect a key to open a door to collect a key[/i] type dungeon. The worst part is that some areas REQUIRE parkour to get to. Places you'll need to go back to multiple times meaning you'll need to do them all over again.

This game is not perfect, it has glaring flaws, it also has outstanding highs and great traits that outshine those flaws, but I hope in this review the glaring flaws are at least acknowledged because they do hold this game back from greatness. The music, the goddamn music, man. What a hit. To everyone who knows about the LP farming method in this game.... just, what a soundtrack, right? I love the artstyle of this game, it's charming and cool at the same time. Wonderful setpieces, locations, creatures, and the classes for the most part (I will never understand why you made the Mimic look like *that*) look stunning. Mechanically, this is the best jrpg I have played. FF5 is one of if not my all time favorite game, a classic and cherished childhood memory with what used to be the best class system I have ever had the experience of using. This game's class system takes what FF5 did and runs all the way down to the touchdown line. You can turn on various options to increase replay value like mad. Randomize classes, items, monsters, even your skills. Make the game harder by changing the party size limit to whatever you like from one to four, for example. Being able to do most of the game in any order you want, at any time, works so wonderfully in this game’s favor. The mod workshop is packed with wonderful and meaningful mods, most are QoL improvements that I think should just be default to the game. The turn system is perfect, the best turn based system I have ever played. Bar none. Crystal Project is strong with how beautiful it all works.... mechanically. The way it is implemented? Holy. Fucking. Airball. 

This is what happens when you have one single developer having the full dominion over a project with no real voice or co-author to reign in ambition and self-understanding. While the mechanics of the game are all near-perfect, while the exploration remains it's strongest point, while the soundtrack and area design are impeccable and atmospheric (except for the final area), there are noticeable difficulty spikes littered throughout the game that then retract instantly afterwards for X amount of time. There are too many instances where certain overworld enemies are a tad too hard compared to what comes before and after their location, there are too many bosses (main and optional) that are way too overtuned for what comes before and after them, the puzzles range from absolute kindergarten level difficulty to ""only the person who made this would know what to do without a guide"" levels of asinine, the story (while admittedly not the focus of the game) is so laughably nothing and corny that it manages to not land with every player (I was fine with it, but a quick run on the forums and google will show you most people thought the story was lame and built up to a disappointment), and the final area..... without spoilering as much as I can, boils down to ""walk down this path and encounter enemies where the gimmick is they blow up your whole party with full HP moves before you can act so I hope you equipped skills that let you survive on 1HP and just keep doing that until you reach the end."" The absolute final stretch of this game was made in a single night, or at least that is how it feels. I'm not going to talk about the lore implications on the area and what that means for any previous statement, but mechanically and for US the player, it feels lazy and uninspired, and Andrew Willman should unironically strive to never again make a section of a game feel like that again. 

In defense of the game now, the developer put in systems to at least circumvent a lot of these problems. I’d rather the problems be solved before the final product, but these circumventions work. There are optional settings you can activate at any time, and I highly recommend you turn ALL of them on. The Enhanced Home Point should have just been how this game works, and the dev even acknowledges that most players will want to enable this option. The amount of not just backtracking but just platforming and parkour in general makes traversing to and from locations a CHORE depending on where you want to go at any given time, especially before well into the game where various fast travel shines are unlocked. Having one home point initially in the game where traveling takes so long without mounts and fast travel shrines always made no sense to me. The Healing Home Point seems like cheating at first until you realize that there comes a point where most people would just have the first save point in the game as their home point and fast travel to it for the insanely nothing priced inn. This just turns an already cheesed out mechanic into a time saver. I personally think the level limit could and should be level 99. Yes, the endgame is designed around level 60, but getting from 60+ to said 99 takes so much time that you might as well reward someone for grinding that out. Plus, unless you are minmaxing so hard you’re essentially powergaming (and if you did math and looked at graphs and charts to understand the endgame’s optimal growth rate reallocation), being level 60 will not be close enough to beating the endgame’s optional content. Easier Non-Bosses makes the  regular encounters in the world a lot less “mini-boss” feeling, as the dev wanted every encounter to feel engaging and not trash-mobby. This means almost EVERY fight in the entire game will want you to at least know optimally what buttons to push or what buffs/debuffs to be using. Yet again, another downside to the dev’s complete creative control with no outside opinion, as this leads to various regular and repeating encounters sometimes leaning towards the aforementioned difficulty spikes rearing their ugly heads. This option tones that down almost completely, and makes this game more playable and feel like an actual normal video game. Custom Difficulty lets you change the difficulty setting on the fly, as normally it is set at save creation. This lets you change the difficulty down to Easy during another difficulty spike moment, then change it back to Normal once you’ve gone past that stuff. Skip Minigames is honestly up to you, I actually have this one remain off myself, but it lets you get around really dumb rubberbanding npc races so bad they make Double Dash look fair and balanced (no, they’re actually very very bad. I just can stomach them I guess?) Extend Timers does not matter except for TWO dungeons in particular. The amount of time the game gives you to complete the mechanic in time requires you to basically be perfect with almost no margin of error. Ironically enough, the “Extend Timers” option makes the game feel actually well-tuned and balance, since the extra time it does give you is not a whole lot and makes it feel like this should have been the original setting. The Boost EXP/LXP/Gold just lets the game go by at a “I have a job” pace, so don’t be afraid to turn them on. 

But outside of all that yeah, great game. 4/5, and I mean that genuinely. Half a star is taken away by the random spikes in difficulty alone. The creator of this game clearly wanted to make their dream game, their idea of an ideal and perfect game. They set out to make this game for them, and I think they completely nailed it and hit it out of the park. They did indeed make the game they wanted to make for themselves. The problem comes when you realize not everyone wants to play their dream game, and most people are going to have the exact same issues with their dream game. It’s just not *our* dream game. And it doesn’t have to be, but I think a lot of people who are fans of this game online need to realize that it still means it ain’t our dream game. Pretty close though.

The Story. Barely worth a hoot. Doesn't really DO anything with its plot of ""fuck around and find out"", sorry, explore the world and find crystals. There's some crap about this world being built on top of an older one but it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. This kind of vague storytelling might've been worked for Dark Souls and its contemporaries but the game doesn't make the effort to make the player CARE about such a reveal or its implications or anything. It tries to push this exploratory theme down the players throat but it just doesn't Work give all of the games other flaws. 

There just isn't much Reason to go explore beyond game progression. Sure, the mounts exist and getting more crystals unlocks more classes but it doesn't mesh well with the themes of exploration that the game preaches so highly. Combined with just how awful the platforming and bits of the level design are--it just feels bad to play. You'd think that some of these jumps were taken straight out of Super Meat Boy with the way you're forced to navigate them. And often when you're forced to perform them all for one stupid chest that only has healing potions that one barely uses--it's more frustrating than anything else.

Then there's combat and the equipment system. My god why the hell are you going to implement an elemental resistance system and then say that it basically doesn't matter for the majority of fights? The only reason you would choose to use a specific element against an opponent is when you're trying to cheese a boss or are trying to get past other elemental resistances. But eight times out of ten you'll just be trying to pile in more non elemental damage instead of specifically targeting one enemy's weakness. Even the elemental weapons you occasionally get are thrown to the wayside for weapons that simply deal more damage since having an elemental weapon is more often than not a detriment when fighting enemies and bosses that resist it--not to mention they often do less damage!

Then the endgame bosses exist. Some of them are genuinely some of the most godawful mechanically designed bosses that I've had the pleasure of facing in an RPG. Apply debuffs on them? Most of them cleanse it immediately and they don't even take a turn to do so! Some of them have mechanics that completely invalidate certain builds and force you to deal with conditions completely unique to their encounter. Sounds great in theory, but some of them are just too troublesome and unbalanced to be fun.

Combined with the hard level cap your choices are to completely rebuild your character to deal with the boss--which leaves a Very bad taste in my mouth since it punishes you for playing the way you like to play--or find a way to counter the horsecrap mechanics that each endgame boss throws at you. Sure, a party at level 99 and on the easiest difficulty might be able to cut through them but if you're playing on the default intended difficulty for the game you're going to have a bad time.",False,0,0,1744710725,N/A,Steam

Everywhere is cumbersome to get to, there is no fast travel, you can't speed up or skip common battles, you can't even use items in battle, you can't even RUN from battles. There are very few Inns and getting back to them is a pain. Currency is scarce. 

Every single battle is a challenge - which at first is kinda cool, but after manual trudge back into zone X and having to fight every single common enemy that you don't literally outrun... it gets old FAST. Especially when you don't have a ton of time to sink into games. Even the most common enemies are extremely OP and getting one-shotted is all too common (and annoying). They introduce taunt which seems great in premise but, you have to taunt each enemy individually so your healer will get smacked.

Any game that copy/pastes FF5's job system gets major kudos from me, but it turned out to just be too much of a slog, especially when compared to its contemporaries. 

Ultimately, Crystal Project introduces unique gameplay mechanics, but fails to even get the basics right.

Exploring is fun, finding secrets or hard to reach treasures that give you an advantage feels rewarding, and the variety of classes hints at some fun mix and match experimentation ala FF5 or FFT.

Unfortunately, a lot of this falls apart as early as the mid game. Basic enemies can frequently kill party members in one or two hits, the jumps used for progress start to get ridiculous, areas are hidden behind terrain that you can't see, and bosses require specific setups rather than allowing for any party comps. The class you're playing when you level up affects your stat gains, but you can pay to reallocate the gains, which means grinding for money against enemies that can easily kill your party, or using specific attack patterns to make the fights trivial, but also a slough. The point of making generic enemies this difficult is to avoid the problem of ""mash attack"" that pops up in a lot of JRPGs, but instead becomes ""cycle through menus for the same attack pattern,"" which is basically the same thing with extra steps. Add into that the expensive MP cost for abilities and relatively low MP pool of your characters, and everything becomes a tedious, plodding chore.

The developer is also huge on status effects being the ultimate decider in whether you win or lose so endgame battle requires a precise combination of buffs/debuffs.  If you don't like that, you don't get to win.  There's 24 classes offered, many them are a waste of time when it comes to endgame.  You can waste hours leveling the ""wrong"" class, due to a mechanic that increases your stats inline with the class you are at the time of leveling up.  

For example if somebody levels up as a Wizard for 50 levels, and then switches to Samurai, their Strength will be super low for their level and not able to perform well.

To fix this there's a mechanic to delevel your characters, so you can relevel them with the right stats.  At the cost of spending many hours with each attempt.

2 - You can't use the mouse for anything at all, not even camera rotation. Not even for ""confirm"" like you can in other similarly controlled games like Secrets of Grindea.

Firstly, enemies over tuned to heck. I admittedly gave up about 15 hours in and turned on cheats so I could actually play the game without tears. I've played tons of RPG's, but rarely have a come across a game dev so insistent on preventing you from ever feeling strong. Enemies will spam aoe that either 1-shots you or close to it, on top of adding debuffs, and they will do this nearly every turn for nearly every enemy in the game.

Secondly, ""exploring"" is not ""hardcore platforming"". Someone with the ability REALLY needs to add the platforming tag to this game. I'm no stranger to platforming games. Celeste, Super Meat Boy, N Ninja, etc, etc, etc. Some of these platforming sections around what I assume is mid-end game are up there with the hardest stuff in those games. It's completely unreasonable, especially if you aren't expecting it. I haven't wanted to throw my controller in years until I unlocked ""swimming"" in this game and went into a certain tree. A platforming tag is necessary since you absolutely can't beat this game without killer platforming skills and an absurd amount of patience.

Buying maps should probably reveal the map. Important things on the map should be labelled automatically. Names of places should be shown on the map. None of these happen, I recommend a notebook on the side if you want to play this game seriously.

Peglin,1637730,13.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198093540693,"Ya know what? Some nandypandy complained about my review, so let me lambast this piece of shit game.

First, exploration is a chore; it really fucking is. Platforming mechanic is unforgiving and tedious garbage. The ways you can overshoot or undershoot jumps are just awful, and the amount of backtracking you have to do sometimes is just unacceptable when some jumps are just so easy to mess up. Then there's the animal companions, which completely overhaul exploration for the better, but only by mitigating the absolutely terrible horseshit problems of exploration.

Second, to say the puzzles and dungeons are bad is an understatement. The battles are tedious bullshit, exploration is at its worst in dungeons, and the puzzles, dear God the puzzles. Let's talk about this Goddamned pile of shit, and almost always involve very specific jumps that again force you to reset the puzzle because fuck this game. One of the worst examples isn't even a puzzle so much as you finding 10 people hidden throughout an underwater area and answer each of their multiple choice questions accurately, which all involve very specific obscure details from the game world.

Third, the story. ""Master of games is disappearing heroes. You must stop them."" isn't a story. There are only a bare minimum of characters, the reasons people do things are dumb, and the worldbuilding just sucks in general. This game's world lore comparable in complexity to Minecraft, and it's an RPG; meditate on this.

Fourth, let's talk about the combat. It's imbalanced. Nothing scales well, so everything feels like it sucks even in the rare instances when it doesn't suck and bringing suck to the suckless. Bosses are bullshit, most encounters are bullshit, random encounters in many places are too powerful.

Fifth, time to talk about the class system. Taking notes from better games does not make your game good; this game takes the style, but the substance was ruined. The classes in this game are all super simplistic versions of the conventional Final Fantasy classes. This is the first game I've ever played where these classes are shit, and here's a list of games that didn't fuck this up: Final Fantasy I, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy XII, Bravely Default, Bravely Second, Bravely Default II, Final Fantasy Tactics. You notice how all of them understand how to make the class system fun and rewarding, but Crystal Project does not? How? Well, allow me to elaborate. This game gives every class very few abilities, makes them hyper specific to an intended build rather than a battle role, and then traps them into that role; in other words it defines a class not based on what a class can do, but what it is restricted to doing. For example, the Samurai in FF games is based on Zenigage or whatever, who would throw coins at his enemy, and is set up to be a heavily armored attacker similar to the Knight. However, in CP, of fuck its initials are CP.... damn. In Crystal Project, the Samurai is about building up the AP gauge to release a combo move, so this is what your Samurai will be doing IN EVERY GODDAMNED BATTLE. Even with interesting added features, they manage to wreck the simple design of the class by pigeonholing it into a preset purpose. Crystal Project simultaneously overcomplicated Samurai and caged it at the same time. This goes for literally every class, you might think. However, there are some exceptions that especially anger me, such as the Aegis being a really crappy version of the Knight, or the Warrior being a debuffer. These changes would be less of a problem if not for the fact that Crystal Project uses these as direct reference to classic RPGs I love, but even then they would still be crap.

Lastly, there's tons of dumb shit like their offbrand Chocobos. Yeah, they made a creature that is basically Chocobos, and they even made a racing game for them and the fish, which both suck because of how this game controls. I would gladly take the shitty Chocobo minigames of FFVII and FFX and all their terrible tedium over this, even the shitty Chocofinder minigame of FFVIII; this content in Crystal Project is just that bad.

You really, really have to love platforming not to find the exploration part frustrating. It's just an endless series of jumping puzzles with little direction and plenty of nasty punishments if you mess up (long backtrack, unwelcome fights etc.).

The combat is good and the character building is a nice riff on the old ff system. But it's mainly the boss fights that are great. The regular fights feel a little overtuned. They're doable of course, but tax your attention and resources (potions to refill mana mainly) and the combat isn't quite interesting enough to make me want to do 10 semi-risky trash fights just to traverse some zone. You can avoid lots of fights, but that relies heavily on being good at the platforming parts.",False,24,2,1715986104,N/A,Steam
Peglin,1637730,13.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198113850999,"Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this. A whole lot of the individual parts are actually pretty good, but they manage to come together to form a massive slog, something that's really far less than the sum of its parts.

For example, individual battles are mostly fun. However, every battle is a steady drain on your very limited resources, so you have the choice of avoiding fights, meaning you'll be underpowered and lacking abilities to fight mandatory fights, or you can grind. It's frustrating, because I chose normal difficulty specifically because it said you shouldn't need to grind. That was an absolute lie. You will need to grind for abilities, and grind for cash to afford better gear and maps, and grind for consumables to sustain your party, either as drops or more money grinding to buy them. You cannot get through this game without a decent amount of grinding, regardless of what the game may tell you.

As another example, the platforming. It's pretty neat in small bouts, and when it works properly it can really lead to an open, intricate feeling world. However, a lot of the jumping paths are long and require many, many precise jumps. And don't think you can savescum these, either. When you reload a save, you're sent back to your last home point, not the point where you saved, which is unspeakably frustrating considering how large some of the maps are. I eventually reached the point where I didn't want to explore anymore because there was just so damn much platforming and it took ages to get anywhere.

Third big example, the job system. Now, I like the jobs I experienced and some of the abilities are interesting. However, many abilities on several classes just felt completely useless. Additionally, because most physical abilities are tied to a specific weapon, you are sorely limited in what abilities you can mix and match. For example, if you level a rogue, most rogue abilities are tied to using a dagger. Switch to a monk, whose abilities use staves or unarmed. Equip trickery as your second ability from the rogue. Now, you can either wield a staff or be unarmed and be able to use all the monk abilities, or waste a passive making yourself able to equip daggers, equip a dagger and be able to use most of the rogue abilities. If you do the first, you have all the monk abilities, but only can only use steal from the rogue. And for the latter, you can use the rogue abilities, but only meditate for the monk. I have no idea why this was designed like this, but it feels awful, and massively incentivizes primarily using magic classes for secondaries, as magic isn't tied to weapons.

Overall, I just got worn out by the game. I set it down to take a break, and realized that I not only had no desire to come back to it, I was really dreading playing more. So no, I can't recommend this one.",False,3,2,1715147254,N/A,Steam
Peglin,1637730,13.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198003065616,"I really really wanted to like this game. But there were a few mechanical choices that really brought it down in my opinion.

The first is build variety. Having so many classes implies the idea of having a lot of room to experiment with a character's growth and build. But many martial class skills are locked to a specific weapon, rendering them useless when used as a subclass. Magic does not have this issue. It feels bad to get a new class that fits the stat spread of one of your characters and simply be unable to combine it with anything else you have. 

Secondly, while the game boasts no random encounters, they are very hard to avoid on the map. Not only that, but they are rather punishing (at least on Hard mode, which I was playing on). They range between brutal to monotonous, where they are a puzzle that need to be solved and once you do, you simply repeat the same optimized process on them to victory. This isn't really an issue, but this leads into my next issue.

When you save and quit the game, you are returned to a save point check point rather than where you quit the game. Furthermore, these save points do not heal your party. Many times I found myself able to play for short session, I make it part way through a location and save and quit. Only to be ported back to the start with all of my used resources gone. I would replace them but..

Everything in the game is very very expensive. If you buy consumables, good luck getting gear upgrades. Without the gear good luck not getting trounced in fights. Even grinding for the money doesn't feel to be a viable option because the fights pay out so little compared to the costs.

The platforming is fun, but I rarely found the rewards for doing so worth it unless it was the core path to a dungeon or boss. The mount system is fun to add platforming abilities like a metroidvania, but you constantly need to swap between them and doing so through even the favorite menu is a pain.

If a reliable form of fast travelling was implemented, then perhaps I could bring myself to shifting my overall opinion to slightly positive, but honestly, the lack of fast travel is going to waste hours and hours of your life in the game, and that's something I can't abide by (I'm not talking about the 11shrines in the game, those don't even take you to 10% of the places you'd want to go, like Nan's place or the fishing place, etc.)... I simply value my time too much to spend it backtracking for hours. I'd honestly rather replay Earthlock or FF9 than play this game anymore.

Though the review is listed as ""not recommended"", that's mainly because I have very high standards. You might like this if the things I mention aren't as negative for you.

Crystal Project was a game recommended to me as an RPG with Metroidvania elements, similar to Wine & Roses and Teenage Costume Squad. I've long thought a commercial-length version of those games would be the best thing ever, so I jumped at the chance to try this.

Unfortunately, the game is just a standard open-world RPG and not the kind of tactical-Metroidvania experience I was hoping for. It has Metroidvania elements, but they're entirely based on traditional Metroidvania principles of overcoming physical barriers, not tactical ones. I wasn't blindsided because the game's description was pretty clear about this, but it was still disappointing. It managed to be good for what it was, but falls into many of the usual problems with both jRPGs and open-world games.

So. The first thing you will notice is that the game looks like Minecraft, which is to say, butt-ugly. I'm told that this art style is called ""voxel"" (short for ""volumetric pixel""). I presume the hideous block style of RPG Maker VX was either a precursor or attempted emulation of this. It's slightly better than RMVX on account of being actually 3D, but it's still hideous and I remain baffled why anyone would willingly make a game in this graphical style. (All those sharp edges, eugh.)

The second thing you will notice is that this game is also a platformer. There is a dedicated jump button and you are forced to use it constantly. Every area is absurdly vertical and demands platforming in order for you to get anywhere; and yes, you'd be correct in assuming this means every area is a minefield of one-way drops. If you fail a platforming challenge, you better hope you set a teleport point near where you started because otherwise you will be spending 5 minutes trekking back there. (The game even has a character joke about this, because it thinks joking about its terrible design decisions makes up for it.) This makes exploration -- you know, the key feature of any Metroidvania or open world -- an absolute chore constantly interrupted by resets instead of any kind of smooth, organic experience. Even the Mario RPGs don't have this much platforming; we did not need this.

Oh, and you can't freely warp between save points, so you'll have to do tons of backtracking regardless. There's an easy mode that magnanimously extends the number of warp points you can store from one to three, which barely helps. The only justification I could possibly see for this is to prevent you from warping to an inn and then back in the middle of a dungeon, except the shrine stones let you do that anyway so there is really no point to this other than wasting the player's time.

If you can get past all of this you can finally start playing the actual game, which is a class-changing jRPG a la Final Fantasy V. Each class has a unique set of abilities, and you can additionally assign the skillset of one other class. Winning battles as a class gets you class experience as well as regular experience, and you can spend class experience to learn new skills. In principle this is all well and good; in practice it's a grindfest because there are way, way too many classes, to the point that your starting classes outnumber your total party members. I really wish we were given a fifth party member to give you just a bit more wiggle room on this. It doesn't help that the class roles are very lopsided -- there are a bajillion offensive casters, several tanks and fighters, and like... two support casters.

The game is also a grindfest in the normal way, too, because as with all jRPGs each area has only 3 or 4 encounters copied dozens of times. To make matters worse, enemies have extremely rigid AI that almost always uses the exact same actions every time, so there are never any curveballs; if you beat an encounter once, the same series of actions will win that encounter again (barring random confounders like misses and crits). Battles quickly become tedious and frustrating due to all the repetition, which is a shame because a lot of enemies have genuinely clever behavior patterns that reward thoughtful counterplay; but, well, you only need to solve a puzzle once. And again as with all jRPGs, 90% of battle is determined on the equip screen, so even if you do know the correct solution to a fight you may not be able to execute it because you forgot to bring the right classes or equipment into the fight, so back to the last save point with you, sucker!

And now we get into the open world aspect, which has the exact same problem as [i]Pokemon Scarlet & Violet[/i]: There is no level scaling, so there is still a linear, intended route you're supposed to play in, just no indication of what that route is. To its credit the game is much better about nudging you towards the right path than S&V (and you can see before a battle how strong the enemies are in relation to you), but there were still multiple times when I slogged through a brutal dungeon only to find myself steamrolling everything in the next one because, oops, turns out I was supposed to do those in the opposite order. I think in principle it's good to give players the freedom to challenge themselves by doing things out of order, but it really shouldn't be possible to do that accidentally.

Of course, even when you do travel along the intended path you will be flattened into paste by the encounters because the game is also absurdly punishing. It's more reasonable in the early game, but once you're past the introductory section enemies will regularly two-shot your characters right at the start of battle, and by the endgame they will frequently oneshot them by doing more damage than they have max HP. This is made worse by an aggro system that ensures they will focus-fire on whoever did the most damage (i.e. your caster); the tank classes are supposed to control this, but enemies also love to spam defense-piercing attacks, so this usually amounts to your tank surviving a single hit at critical health instead of being instantly reduced to giblets, and that's it. Your healer has to be constantly spamming the heal-all spell when they're not desperately reviving people, which is just a deeply unfun way to play. I do not want one of my four characters locked into doing a single action the entire fight, thanks. Most of your strategy involves disabling enemies so that they can't attack you at all, because it's that or instant death with no middle ground.

Another common RPG element the game uses that I hate: Refusing to decouple quantitative and qualitative equipment bonuses. You like inflicting poison with your weapon attacks? Too bad, that weapon falls below the curve once you enter the midgame. There are so many interesting equipment effects and I especially liked how weapon skills retained the add-on effects of your weapons, but they're all rendered obsolete by the power curve far too quickly.

It's a shame, because I do feel there are good elements here. The diversity of the classes is impressive, and I particularly liked how they managed to make rogues feel mechanically distinct from fighters. Enemies will throw some pretty weird stuff at you and it's fun to think about how you're supposed to use your tools to counter them. Oh, and items are restricted to one class (Final Fantasy Tactics style), so in-battle MP management actually matters! I just wish those clever ideas didn't have to be chained to such tedious, repetitive, punishing gameplay. jRPGs need to break out of the genre conventions that have held them hostage for so long and realize that challenges need to be placed tactically, like in every other genre, not copy-pasted willy-nilly as if that's a substitute for real gameplay.",False,1,0,1706104052,N/A,Steam

Phasmophobia,555160,24.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Indie",76561198042171998,"A fast, tactile VR FPS that channels a Counter-Strike-like energy: tight rounds, bomb plants/defuses, and clutch moments, translated into full-body presence. Manual mag handling, bolt pulls, and sight alignment make every reload and peek feel earned.

Gameplay & Mechanics — 8/10
Snappy gunfeel with satisfying manual reloading and clear hit feedback. Movement options cover stick locomotion and smooth turning; room-scale peeking around corners is a genuine edge. Occasional jank and the learning curve on weapon handling can spike early deaths, but mastery is rewarding.

Modes & Content — 8/10
Classic Search & Destroy sits alongside a grab bag of community favorites (TTT, Zombies, WW2, Gun Game). The workshop/custom servers are the secret sauce - maps and modes keep the playlist fresh, though quality varies server to server.

Presentation & Audio — 8/10
Clean visuals for quick reads under headset constraints; positional audio and proximity voice chat add tension (and hilarious chaos). Not a visual showpiece, but it prioritizes clarity where it counts.

Comfort & Accessibility — 7/10
Smooth locomotion can challenge VR newcomers; comfort tweaks help, but motion-sickness-prone players may need shorter sessions. Weapon manipulation is immersive but demands practice and decent controller tracking.

Conclusion
Pavlov VR is a fun, Counter-Strike-like arena shooter made better by VR’s hands-on gunplay and a thriving custom scene. It’s not the most polished or guided experience, but if you want competitive rounds with real-world reloading and endless community variety, it delivers.

The game thrived on mods with players making crazy custom modes and maps. You could easily lose yourself for hours in the variety. The devs made the decision to move everything to UE 5, and in the process essentially nullified all existing mods. The issue with doing that to a game that's been out for a while is that a lot of the modders aren't actively keeping things up to date, so we lost all the COD zombie maps and have only gotten 1 or two back a WHILE later after some dedicated modders revived them.

So in short, the devs attempt to shore up the game is the very thing that ended up breaking everything good about it, which has led to an exodus of the playerbase. At this point, its maybe one or two populated servers, and then a ton of private lobbies and empty lobbies. And sadly, I can't blame them. Keep in mind, this game made the move to UE 5 in summer of 2023. Plenty of time to fix it up for the modding community, so this is not just a matter of impatience but an active decision to stall / not consider it.

Since the update, i've installed the game twice in the last year to see where it's at, and sadly it seems mostly everything has stopped dead in Feb. No new mods really, no new dev updates, no new mod kit expansions to allow for the people still playing to save it.

The game itself is very well-made, offering solid mechanics and immersive gunplay, but the experience you’ll actually have depends heavily on who you’re playing with and that’s where things start to fall apart.

First off, most of the PC servers are practically dead. The player base is much smaller compared to the Pavlov Shack version on Quest, which means finding active and populated lobbies can be a struggle. Even when you do find one, Pavlov isn’t beginner-friendly at all. The community tends to be impatient and impulsive in modes like TTT, players will often kill you for no reason, with little to no cooperation or understanding for newcomers.

If you’re new, you’ll likely find it frustrating trying to compete against experienced players who play daily and have the right equipment. It’s hard to have fun when the learning curve feels more punishing than engaging.

Because of that, I’d only recommend Pavlov if you plan to play with a group of your own friends. Playing with randoms from the community is rarely a pleasant or viable option. The game has great potential and craftsmanship, but without a stable, welcoming player base, it ends up feeling more isolating than enjoyable.",False,4,2,1761763426,N/A,Steam

I was really looking forward to trying Pavlov VR, but unfortunately the performance issues made it hard to enjoy.

Pavlov [i] used [/i] to be a really good VR shooter. Fun gunplay and generally good vr mechanics, but most importantly, REALLY good mods. It had custom maps like Dust2, Rust, etc, along with my personal favorites, the CoDZ maps such as Origins with working staffs and BO2 weapons like the Hamr and Raygun Mark II.

Key word, [i] used [/i] to be. One day, the devs decided to update their game to allow crossplay, which changed the way modding worked, being that it wasn't supported on the workshop anymore on the newest version and instead moved to a different website. Normally, this would be fine, and it was since you could simply play on an older version of Pavlov to keep playing with the workshop mods you liked. People who wanted to play the vanilla game/could only play the vanilla game on PlayStation could play the newer, maintained version, and people who wanted to play with mods could play the older, unmaintained version, and not have to worry about old mods that are complete, or whose authors have stopped playing Pavlov disappearing.

But one day, the devs removed the older version from the Steam betas, essentially deleting all of the older mods that haven't been updated, and may never be updated. Some people kept playing the game for those mods, and some people bought the game for those mods, and now most of them are gone.

Instead of updating the legacy version to fix any game breaking issues or vulnerabilities or simply leaving it alone to let the community fix it, they essentially erased a lot of the game's history, and the reason for a good chunk of the playerbase's reason to keep playing along with it, and they didn't even remove the workshop from the community tab or add a warning that the game doesn't support the workshop anymore, which could lead to someone buying the game for something that doesn't exist anymore.

This game is a shadow of its former self, and they don't even give you the option to play the game in a version you enjoyed offline, let alone with friends or on a community server.

The changes led to an exodus from what was once a great WW2 milsim. Many days, you'll be lucky to see 1 full server running.

It had a great run, but the devs seem determined to kill off the last few of us who were dedicated to the niche.

There is more but that's just what came off the top of my head. The flaws though are numerous and really ruin the experience if you are not willing to look past it. Optimisation can get horrible as most Offworld games has shown numerous times, the game play is repetitive with it being constantly the same way of playing over and over, with barely anything new happening in that way also there are different game modes but they are to similar or just never used which brings me into my next point. The servers are abysmal, there is almost zero players on in weekdays, and weekends only have one or two with at most 50 players. These servers are also shit its always the same maps, France and operation market garden which can get so boring, I have not played the D-Day map which is the one that I wanted to play the most, also I have not played as the Australian's which I also want as a Aussie myself and the new pacific maps I have barely played but when i did i found them the most enjoyable. Battle of the bulge has seemed to disappear from the roster also there is a voting system setting in servers but only one of them has it that I have seen but hasn't had players in ages. All this is caused also by how you have to pay to make servers so only large communities can really make them. Offworld has also not made any official servers which would be better in my opinion as they could make a official server in each campaign so you don't have to wait for it to pop up, or just make servers free to make. But all this is useless if our community is so small. I would recommend this because if we had more people it would make it a better game in general but that's just me being selfish because I really want to like and enjoy this game.

As an avid enjoyer of first person shooters, this is really fun once you get into combat situations. Its not a spectacle like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Instead, its much closer to Hell Let Loose. 

Unfortunately, new players like me who are not experienced with realistic shooters struggle to properly engage in these battles. Another issue is that there aren't enough servers in asia which makes it hard for me to play the game at a smooth performance because of the high ping. The game's file size is also clearly large.

Still, I find that the gameplay is very engaging. Guns are responsive and close quarters combat is intense. The game also has a wide selection of weapons and vehicles to choose from, so the game is great for you if you're into tanks.

Putting the Squad44 title on the game the previous developers abandoned is not good for the studio. Like what was so wrong with the name Post Scriptum? Now when I see this game and the failure it has become I cant help but think negatively of Squad ( the actually halfway decent game). This game somehow does the class systems worse than in Squad, and it's already stupid in that game too. Maps are impossible to read and the icons/overlays are not easily discernible. No one ever knows what to do or where to go. That's to say IF you can even find a server with enough people to actually play. As soon as Hell Let Loose releases a Pacific Theater where we can play as Japs and US Marines, no one will care about this game. Offworld should've left this one alone and spent their resources on the Starship Troopers game. I am tired of seeing ads for this game, I already own it, I know it's a dead game, been this way for years. The fact that they're still pushing ads for it is downright slimey in my opinion. Anyone who buys the game will have nothing to do, no one to play with, and ultimately have their money stolen from them. Let this one go, move onto the next one. All this being said, it's truly sad to say. The game looks and sounds good when it's not bugging out.

Post Void,736220,11.99,0,multiplayer,"Action, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy",76561198071216488,"I once loved this game called Post Scriptum and used to play it a lot, hence the 1k hours I sank into it. But in the current State it is just unplayable. There is a multitude of Bugs like hearing Engine noises everywhere on the map as if they are right next to me or not hearing gunfire and explosions at all. Additionally, the performance dropped significantly to low fps and frequent stutters. The worst thing for me is that the severity and number of problems I ran into in a single match didn’t occur to me in hundreds of hours playing Post Scriptum.

To me it seems that the players with lots of experience and an interest in good high level teamplay have disappeared. I just recently had a match where the squad leader was a member of the Clan hosting the Server but still didn’t bother to lead or at least communicate with his Squad. This decline in the community is fatal for a game where teamplay and good leadership is the key of having fun. And instead of Offworld trying to get these people back they only use the old Squad strategy of making a free weekend which floods the Servers with guys having no idea what they are doing and giving the experienced players only the chance to lock themselves into private groups or quit playing until the flood has stopped. Adding to the bad shape of the community is that when someone dared to state this fact he got immediately attacked verbally by the loyal Zealots of Squad44.

Besides the Bugs, Offworld also managed, under the premise of fixing Spaghetti Code, to strip Post Scriptum of most of the things that made it unique. It had, other than Squad, a free building System making the logistic squads extremely capable in offense and defense, but they needed to fix that and implement the system from Squad. They also felt the need to implement the suppression system from Squad(which decides to work on the premise of how it could annoy you the most), removed the timer form the Rally Points (I know they are called Regroup Calls, but I have yet to find someone calling them by that name) making the Radioman nearly obsolete. And in general, they seemed to just Squadify the game wherever possible without thinking about the consequences. Like the time when they removed the MSPs or increased the player cap for Servers without them being able to handle it, which still results in bad hit registration for infantry weapons. They also kept introducing more uncommon vehicles like the Jagdtiger to the game, while the charm of Post Scriptum was that it felt like two regular units were fighting against each other with Shermans and Cromwells against Panzer 3 and 4s. I wouldn’t be surprised if they went ahead and added a Maus in the future.

I am shaken to say it, but this game is nothing like the game I once loved and with Offworld at the helm, I fear that they will only add new shiny ‘content’ instead of fixing the bugs, improving the performance and making the gameplay loop fun again. It seems to me that Post Scriptum is dead and Squad44 has killed it only to use its soulless husk to milk the WW2 enjoyers. So I can only say thank you Offworld for not just killing one but two games that I used to love.

But the name.... it's not doing this game any favors. A very basic lore primer and a name that shows even a bit of effort goes a very long way toward garnering attention in this genre. The developer is ""ZeroTris"". Off the top of my head ""Zero Colony"" or ""Colony Zero"" would be an insanely better name than ""A Colony"". The name makes it sound like a side project or a project that's only made to generate some quick cash before being abandoned.

Okay, I'm done ranting about the terrible name slapped onto a very good game. I have no opinion about co-op because I have no desire to play a colony sim in multiplayer after realizing it detracts from the experience for me after trying it in other games. I want to build my colony and play my way without someone interfering in my plans. As a single player experience, this game is polished for its current state and fun.",True,4,0,1688594244,N/A,Steam

However, certain frustrating aspects of this game have had me pulling my hair and screaming at my colonists for a big part of my gameplay and these aspects could easily be fixed. 

First off is the priority system. When given an order, colonists should remember it and it should take priority over other tasks. Colonists who are supposed to eat or sleep will start you order and dismiss it to go do something else completely forgetting your order and making your re-order them multiple times for one single action. maybe also consider adding the option to queue actions. these would only be useful when colonists need to do something urgent that does not fall inside their assigned tasks. when you tell a colonist to flee he should flee. not walk one step and go back into combat. when i tell a sleeping colonist to do something he should do it not go back to bed after walking out of it. 

please consider unifying the overlapping two priority systems. there should not be so many places where priorities can be tweeked as it greatly hinders gameplay and makes troubleshooting really hard when colonists arnt doing what you desire. keep it all in one place please.

mental breakdowns happen too fast. i've lost count of the times i added a single colonist and before i could make the changes every other colonist desired, one would have a breakdown attack the wrong targent and start a whole insect attack on the base at the worst possible moment. in two days of gameplay i have found myself and my co-op partner reloading our save file over 20 times because of un-salvageable situations created by when colonists did something catastrophic and we where not watching for 2 seconds.

Why does my co-op partner get notifications for gang attacks targeting me but not insect attacks ?

This game is so much fun and i cannot wait for the game play experience to be less frustrating and smoother

Of all of the Resident Evil games that I have played, it contains the least action, but is better for it, as it really shines best when exploring its dark, twisted setting. The best section of the game involves going through the large Baker house - a dilapidated estate in Louisiana Bayou. It's a truly inspired setting, and Capcom nailed the Southern Horror vibe incredibly well - it's extremely authentic and believable. The attention to detail is amazing, and it's the most memorable haunted house/house of horrors setting in any media that I've been exposed to. The story is excellent, and very intriguing, as you piece together why Ethan is there, what's really going on, and what happened to the Baker family. They're extremely memorable villains and very menacing as well. Also, even nearly 9 years after release, at the time of writing, the game looks incredible. Up close, some of the character models are showing age, but in the moment-to-moment, the visual fidelity is awesome and the performance is incredible. I also enjoyed the 1st person setting much more than I thought I would - I think it's absolutely necessary for the kind of game they crafted, and it is more immersive than the 3rd person RE games, by necessity, as that's really what you're getting here - a very engaging and immersive horror experience.",True,0,0,1764061758,N/A,Steam

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198371930993,"I think this game has a pretty middling story, a pretty terrible protagonist, and it sort of falls off in the second half. There are no puzzles which go beyond ‘find three different colored things to open the thing door,’ and there is almost nothing in this game which does not exist outside of decades old, well established horror tropes.

Despite all of that, this game is STILL A BANGER. Yeah my wife is a bitch and has crazy spaghetti hair, I don’t even give a damn its still a banger. Yeah the second half is much worse than the first half, you know what other game has an even worse second half? DARK SOULS, and that game? Yeah chat, you guessed it, BANGER.

Ethan Winters is a dipshit and I cannot excuse his actions but the rest of the cast are really good. Jack Baker is so scary and his actor put in 110% effort, getting chased by him can wildy swing between pee-my-pants terrifying and pee-my-pants funny. Him laughing and giggling while stalking you, and going “I seeee youuuuuu!” when he spots you, what an incredible character and enemy design. (Ethan ruins it, of course, whenever he opens his mouth but Jack is still my goat.)

Past Jack, it is not quite as good, but still enjoyable. Big ups to Margy, I killed that damn bug bitch but she seemed nice. Lucas is a shithead who pussed out after I got through all his coward ass traps but thats okay I forgive him. I actually found the decision between my wife (i think her name was Mia, idk) and Zoe to be difficult. Let me lay it out for you.

Mia Pros:
My Wife
Kissed me
Known her for many years

Mia Cons: 
Weird Spaghetti hair
Lied to me about being secret umbrella agent (cringe)
Cut my hand off (wtf babe)


Zoe Pros:
Funny
Normal human hair (huge)
Helps me out the whole time
Sense of humour (funny 2)

Zoe Cons:
From Louisiana (weird accent)
Not as funny as Jack (but nobody is, so not big deal)

In the end, I picked my wife because the other one dies anyway and my choice doesn’t matter, but it was a real moral conundrum for a moment there.
Back to that funny thing, I think RE7 balances horror and levity really well, offsetting tense moments with spots of relief or humor, and then doubling down on the anxiety. This game is crazy spooky, and has some of the best audio design ever. The first few hours I had to take a break every 15 minutes because you are just hearing weird shit all of the time, and can’t tell exactly how far away it is; just some of the best atmosphere building in any game ever. 

The music is great, the characters are really well performed (fuck you ethan) and the house is very big and very cool. I think I am going to remember this house for years to come, each and every inch of it has been etched into my mind.

So in the end, yeah, you can poke a bunch of holes in it, and critique it to shreds if you want, but instead of being a big nerd and analysing everything, I will say that I really enjoyed my experience of playing this game, and I won’t forget it for many years.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198309631592,"There's a lot to say about this game. Firstly, its not like any other Resident Evil game, it's so far from the familiarity of heavy action-packed gameplay and instead focusses solely on horror, horror and horror. Biohazard 7 truly broke the mould (no pun intended) of what everyone knew the franchise was about. Aesthetically, gameplay-wise, narratively, everything about this has been carefully crafted to be it's own independent story without too much reference to the other games. This is perfect, it's a breath of fresh air and grounds the player in the world that they're in through the eyes of Ethan Winters. We're not just playing as Ethan Winters, we feel like we are Ethan Winters weaving our way through a great story with just the right amount of exposition, tension, action, and emotion.

There are hardcore fans of the Resident Evil franchise who have been there since the beginning and express their discomfort with the new direction this game took. It's so different that it doesn't actually feel like a Resident Evil title, but instead an actual horror game like Silent Hill, Still Wakes the Deep, Find Yourself, etc etc. Whether you like the game or not depends. Do you want another heavily action packed resident evil with boulder-punching Chris Redfield with an ocean of bullets, or do you want something fresh, subtle, with amazing narrative and story?

Personally, I think this is by far the best Resident Evil title ever. Though, that's mostly because the game rejuvenated the franchise and attracted new fans which contributed to the popularity of the remakes and new titles after that. That and the fact that the game is just perfect. It's a beautiful gem. If I had to give first place to any other Resident Evil game, it would be Resident Evil 4 remake, then RE8 Village and then RE2 remake.

Coming from playing the older RE games and being amazed at their action and scale, stepping into RE7 felt like entering a whole new era of Resident Evil — and I LOVED every second of it.

The story is insane in the best way possible. The mystery of the Baker family, the creepy atmosphere, the plot twists, and finding out the truth behind Eveline… bro, I was hooked the entire time. Every reveal just made me go “NO WAY, so SHE was behind all this!?”

The gameplay is tight and genuinely scary. The first-person perspective hits different — it puts you right in Ethan’s shoes. Exploring the Baker house felt like being inside a horror movie. The tension, the footsteps, the doors slowly opening… damn. Peak horror.

I also loved how the characters operate in this game. Jack chasing you down the hallway like he owns the place, Marguerite with her creepy insect powers, Lucas being a psycho genius… and Ethan? That dude is HIM. The man takes more damage than any human should and still keeps going just to save Mia. Respect.

And bro — the guns feel AMAZING. The shotgun slaps, the pistol feels crisp, and every upgrade hits hard. When you finally get fully geared? You feel like a badass walking through hell to end everything.

Overall, Resident Evil 7 reminded me why this franchise is GOATED. It’s terrifying, emotional, intense, and unforgettable. If you love horror, story, and pure Resident Evil vibes, this is a masterpiece.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198368368439,"THIS GAME SUCKS!

Alright now that I have your attention. I'd rate the game a 5/10 maybe lower for a few reasons. The game not pausing while in menus adds to the tension but it doesn't really work with RE, I hate the blocking mechanic and never was able to get it down and the game just feels dated in some areas. I am a fan of the compliment sandwich system though so I'll say some things I like to begin and end.

[SPOILERS AHEAD]

The story is AMAZING and honestly was the only thing that got me through the later 3/4ths of the game. You really feel for the victims of this story unlike other RE games where you just shoot them with no remorse it's the only RE game that delved into the humanity of what is actually happening. The puzzles too were great! They managed to do so much with so little space and it was a perfect master class YET AGAIN on how to do perfect survival horror level design.

Everything after the main house sucks and I would never replay any of it. Jack is the KING of this game and his section is the only fun one. His boss fights are amazing and make you go ""OH WHAT THE F-"" more than once while fighting him plus there are multiple ways to beat him. It's no secret that all the first zones in RE games get more love (The RPD, Downtown Raccoon City, The Village in RE4, and Castle Dimitrescu) but this game has it the worst by far.

Marguerite's section and boss fight suck, the bugs are annoying to fight, the puzzles and level design in her section suck
I'd never play Lucas's section again, it was predictable at best and horrific at worst.
THE BOAT BLOWS ASS. Straight poop like there is nothing to save this zone it goes on for way to long. ""Oh hey! Lets make the player play through THE WHOLE SHIP in this VHS tape... THEN MAKE THEM DO IT AGAIN!"" Like there is no point it just kills an hour of your time.
The salt mines is just a ammo dumb and F you if you don't have enough
I was this close to quitting on all of these sections. The amount of times I'd go ""bet this annoying thing is about to happen"" then it happened was horrible.

The DLC's are horrible, Bedroom and Daughters are amazing all the others suck. 21 is ""fine"" if you aren't going for the achievements. Ethan Must Die and Jack's 55th Birthday are just there to pad out time and Nightmare is just a hoard shooter. Not A Hero and End Of Zoe are both pretty good but leave a lot of plot holes and clearly needed more time in the oven to be perfect, I really think either could have been as good if not better than the whole game but lacked behind sadly. You really wan't me to believe LUCAS was the mastermind of the whole thing and was in connections with a international terrorist organization? Yeah right! Eve was just chill with being sold again? Or was he somehow strong enough to overcome the mind control? They don't explain any of this. Jack comes back in End Of Zoe which is crazy, you can tell it's him too before the big reveal because they used the same animations.

GOD FORBID you try and 100% this game like I did. There is the standard challenge of like ""Read All Files"" or ""Break All The Mr. Everywhere Dolls"" but HOLY this was the worst. I have 100% RE2, RE3, RE4, and RE8 and out of all of them this was the worst. The others were fun all the way through but this sucked. So many are challenges in the DLCs and others are just annoying to pad out time, locking an achievement behind ""Ethan Must Die"" I wanna force whoever came up with that to sit down and play that until they get it because there is NO WAY they have it.

Eve is horribly written. I don't feel bad for her, I don't care about her, I don't understand her. She is meant to be like the Bakers where you feel bad for her by the end of the story but she just sucks. She comes across as an annoying spoiled princess and that isn't what she is meant to be. She is meant to be a traumatized kid who doesn't understand the world, she is scared and just wants a loving family. She instead comes across like ""Father I want a pony NOW!"". She is just a posh prick that lacks anything interesting and I actually think she is the most annoying character in every single RE game I have played AND I WENT THROUGH HELL WITH ORIGINAL ASHLEY. She is just annoying and I can't take her seriously at all, it is a shame she is the main villain in the story (But wait actually it's Lucas as a DLC shows off like wtf?) because she lacks anything interesting with her. She is just a brat and I hate it.

The horror is on point though! A lot of the time I was too annoyed or frustrated to be scared but if you enjoy the game I can see it being the scariest RE game. You are just some average guy! Not a cop, not a STARS special agent or FBI. You are just Ethan Winters, and that is horrifying. You feel so powerless even after you get the good guns and that is something the game does very well.

I would never play it again fully. Maybe play the Baker house again then just stop there but the later half of the game is horrible and I lost love for it way before that. Granted, the one I played before it was RE4 so anything that came after the literal BEST GAME the whole franchise has to offer was gonna suffer but this was just an outdated experience",False,0,0,1761960591,N/A,Steam

Al the fear I was supposed to feel was replaced with frustration. This game seems kind of cool, but I definitely enjoyed 2, 3, and 4 far more. Nothing is really too scary, it just seems like jumpscares. I don't mind puzzle solving, but fighting seems so clunky.

I especially don't like how the game doesn't stop when I open my map or inventory (which SOUNDS better for the fear factor, you're never safe, but it really just causes annoyances when I'm trying to do something and get attacked from behind).

[h2]Interesting story and setting[/h2]
The Louisiana Bayou is a cool setting and yields a ton of potential, especially in terms level design and character building. The crazy redneck-inspired antagonist family bears a strong resemblance to the Sawyer family from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The opening scenes are crazy-well made and on par with real horror films. Sadly, the intriguing, cinematic, horror craziness last only for the prologue and ends after the gameplay starts.

[h2]Clunky fps-gameplay ruins the experience[/h2]
I was intrigued by the first-person take on the Resident Evil 7, especially because I was never drawn to earlier RE games, due to their 3rd person gameplay. The first person perspective works wonders in bringing alive the tight hallways and creaky rooms of the old Bayou-house, but ultimately ruin the whole thing when it comes to combat. The fps-combat feels like if a game developer decided to implement first person gameplay, while actively trying to make it as clunky and unfunny as possible:
[list]
[*]The field of view is like 80deg at max.
[*]You cannot truly ADS with guns - meaning that you'll miss like 50% of the shots due to RNG, even if you play fps games and know how to aim
[*]The black goo-monsters are infuriating. Fighting the first few of them in the basement is fine. But after you complete the basement sequence, they'll start appearing all around the house. Their HP is clearly RNG-based, meaning that sometimes you'll down one with 3 headshots, but some of them consume all of your ammo. The monsters have twitchy head animations, and thus you'll miss most of your shots unless you use the shotgun.
[*]The bosses are tanky as hell and consume like 95% of your ammo. 
[*]The bossfights are designed with janky 3rd-person style mechanics where you have to aim for magic weak-spots if you want to make any actual progress. Shooting bosses in the head - like in other shooters - doesn't have a special effect.
[*]You don't have a replenishing source of ammunition, or a any good melee weapons - meaning that if you're not careful enough, you can actually run out of ammo and meds, soft-locking yourself out of bossfights, and forcing you to load previous saves from hours ago.
[/list]

I played through the game up to the point where you fight Jack in the goo-monster form, inside the swamp house. Having to redo 10-minute bossfights due to annoying mechanics is a nightmare. We're not playing a souls-like here so wtf? It completely breaks the immersion and ruins the mood when you try to enjoy the scary horror plot.

I would change my mind on the game, if the 1st person combat was actually fluid and responsive, otherwise I'd be happier with more traditional RE 3rd person gameplay. This just sucks.",False,0,1,1760916779,N/A,Steam

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198061440886,"This is not Resident Evil. This does not even resemble Resident Evil. The tone is wrong, the feel is wrong, the design is wrong. This game is a generic first person action horror, with no personality of its own to set it apart from any other horror games or horror movies from which it liberally borrows and mashes up ideas.

Resident Evil 7 was the single most unpleasant experience I have had with this series and I own and have played and beaten Resident Evil Gaiden. I enjoy and still play RE Survivor on occasion and that game is objectively terrible but it is Resident Evil in tone, feel, and design.

The protagonist, Ethan Winters is a faceless, milktoast, nothing-burger. The player is given no reason to care about him or sympathize with him for even a second. Steve Burnside from Code: Veronica is a better character than Ethan. Joseph Frost from RE1 is a better character and left more of an impression than Ethan and Joseph dies in the opening cutscene of RE1.

The primary enemies, the molded, are lazy pallet swapped mashups of previous and better enemies from the series, namely the leach men in RE0, the regenerators in RE4, and the ooze in RE Revelations. The variety of molded is also minimal, they come covered in either black or white mold and skinny or fat, very lazy design. One variant does walk on all fours and jump but that just makes them a black licker without the tongue.

The Bakers are neither interesting nor developed enough to warrant any emotional response other than annoyance and boredom. Jack Baker is a stalker enemy but speaks far too much to be intimidating. Margarite Baker is so forgettable, I had to double check her name for this review as I could only remember her as the ""insect woman"". Lucas Baker is probably the weakest villain in the series and would fit nicely into the villain role in the later Saw films which are also terrible. Imagine Chop Top from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 with Jigsaw's engineeeing knowledge and that sums up Lucas pretty well. These particular enemies also swear at you like a 12 year old trying to shock their parents, apparently that is what makes modern media mature and edgy.

The remaining characters Zoe Baker and Mia Winters also have nothing to offer besides an ultimately unsatisfying choice. No matter which choice you make, you as the player lose because you played this game. One character is an innocent bystander deserving of salvation but choosing her nets the bad ending. The other is bio-terrorist but by saving her you net the ""good"" ending. Pretty stupid for a series about characters trying to stop bio-terrorist.

The story, is never good, but it only continues to decline in quality and entertainment after leaving the Baker estate.  The two final areas, the ship and the caves, are so generic and unmemorable that I struggle to recall anything about them other than the feeling that they would never end.

The final boss and surprise (not so suprise) main villain is unremarkable. All the boss fights are interchangeable due to the nature of the mold, they all look the same, black mold with a weak spot. Remeniscent of the Uroboros monsters from RE5.

The final cherry on top is a cameo from an imposter Chris Redfield, who also gets his own DLC. His character model must have been heavily criticized by the fans because the devs of RE8 put the real Chris in that game. This should be enough to tell any fan of the series how much Capcom thought of the fans that they could throw a completely random character in and call him Chris Redfield to loosely connect what should otherwise be a game in a new IP.

Full disclosure, I purchased this game but I did not play the game myself. I watched and commented as my friend put 20 hours into this game for YouTube recording purposes but I will never play or watch this game again. RE8 being a direct sequel to this is responsible for my decision to never purchase or play RE8 even for recording purposes. I have no desire to return to or support any new entries in this franchise until it returns to being Resident Evil. 

The remakes have been great but they are a distinctly different flavor than classic RE. Regardless, Capcom has been dropping the ball when it comes to new stories in this series since RE4, which is a great action game but a terrible Resident Evil game.

Some thoughts: the teleport event seems pointless—its only function is to move you to another biome, but there’s no meaningful reset or shift in pacing.

When it wants to work (keep that sentiment in mind), messing around with it is incredibly fun, and it can be fascinating to see how broken you can get. So why is this a ""not recommended"" review?

The answer's quite simple: Gearbox and Take-Two have their grubby mitts on this game. Between their predatory EULAs and other scummy business practices, not to mention how they've handled the game itself since taking over, Hopoo's legacy and the hard, honest work of those who have worked on Alloyed Collective have effectively been spat on repeatedly. They want control over everything in the IP, and that includes information on those who play it. You're more than welcome to keep going on it if you trust Gearbox and Take-Two with the stuff on your computer and trust them with every fibre of your being (although why you would want to do that is beyond me). Because, per their EULA, if what they cause via those methods ruins something, you can't hold them liable.

Probably the biggest red flag is that multiplayer itself is completely dysfunctional half of the time. And by ""dysfunctional"", I mean ""it will straight up not load at all, no game for you"". Considering that multiplayer is a pretty major pull for a roguelike such as this one, that's just such a big no-no. And as a result of our [i]dear publishers[/i], I don't know - or care - if those problems will be fixed.

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,29.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561197983886714,"I'm annoyed at this game.  I don't think it's even remotely on the level of Hades 1, and there is not one quality of life or any improvement I could name about the game that sets the bar higher than the previous title.

  I think Hades 2 punishes the player directly or indirectly for too many things, has too much bullet hell mechanics, too much indiscriminite crap happening on screen making it impossible to predict (especially when considering your own boon effects visually proc-ing), too many mediocre min-maxed boons, mediocre pets, mediocre weapons, mediocre story progression, mediocre music except for a couple of tunes that shine (Olympus Aflame, Siren battles etc).  The game feels to me as if the developers watched too many speed runs of their previous game, and forgot that the vanilla game doesn't need to be in an arms race with insane speed runners who have nothing else to do.

Why not let the player take more boons in the first area on the way to Olympus similar to the rat maze?  Then restrict the rooms later via heat level?  Why am I staring at 8 rooms and only able to choose 6?  I honestly want to install a mod manager for the game because getting the combination you want is less likely to happen across time than the heat death of the entire cosmos.  The game could probably be balanced IMO easily by simply adding like 2-3 chambers/encounters per region.

Why are the chaos trials so fun, yet the builds from those trials are utterly and completely unbuildable?  Yet another unintentional punishment to the player ""here is something you can never do nor achieve! enjoy!""  If the odds of a deck of 52 cards being shuffled is basically guaranteed to be unique - then the odds of a single Hades 2 game is probably unique with more than twice or thrice as many combinations.  I challenge someone to figure out the math on it.  How the heck did they even playtest it then, is also my question.  Clearly they didn't in some cases (Hermes boon that affects percentages gets nerfed on Sea Star if you level up Sea Star later for example).

  I'm having a difficult time enjoying any of it, and just fizzling out on heat level 6 Olympus runs because the heat level bosses are just stupid.  I never felt this way about Hades 1 heat level bosses, it was always epic and exciting getting amped for the plus level boss fights.  Now it's like ""what random 2-frame timing projectile bullshit are they going to throw at me now"".  Too much projectile hell in a world where you basically never get Athena's dash.  It's nearly impossible to get a decent intentional build, and even when I do ( for example just did a run where I got a Zeus + Hera duo boon granting me +12 on all my zeus boons) but then of course I have like 1 death defiance left because the poison battle with Medea and Polyphemus is absolute and pure bullshit, and then the fight with whats-her-bucket after that will finish you off.

It feels like this game never left beta, and I'm just not excited to play it anymore, or even finish the story.  It's extremely frustrating.  Melinoe is possibly one of the most boring characters written in the history of games, she isn't exactly unpleasant at least.  She seems to be the kind of girl girls would aspire to see themselves as, fair enough.  But just bland as pouring baking flour in your oatmeal.  The only carrot is the story of Melinoe's family dragging me along, and it's so few and far between that this story develops, it makes Persephone's presence in the previous game seem like she practically lived in Tartarus.",False,1,0,1764129010,N/A,Steam

I supported this in early access but after all this time the game just doesn’t pull me in like the first one did. The tone, writing, and presentation constantly break immersion instead of building it.

The story and dialogue never clicked for me. In Hades 1, conversations felt clever and fitting for mythic figures. Here, it’s casual and repetitive, and the characters rarely grow or respond meaningfully to your progress. The plot never gave me the same drive or emotional hook that made Zagreus’ journey compelling.

The characters feel weaker, and Melinoë never really develops, even after dozens of victories. The cast lacks the charm and spark of the first game, and the serious tone never lands because there’s no wit or emotional payoff.

The redesigns of many characters feel wrong, they clearly weren’t meant to immerse you in the world or tell the story, but to do something else entirely. That takes me out of the game more than anything else.

Gameplay is solid at its core, but the magic of the first game isn’t there. Weapons feel too similar, combat is slower, and builds rarely feel impactful. Progression is bloated with too many materials and grindy systems that make runs feel like chores. On top of that, screen clutter from attacks and effects often makes fights frustrating because you can’t see what’s happening.

Overall, the game lost the personality, charm, and tight design that made Hades 1 special. Supporting it early felt exciting, but the final result just didn’t deliver, and if this is the direction Supergiant sticks with, I won’t be backing their next project.",False,0,0,1764113779,N/A,Steam
Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,29.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198443246713,"[h1]Overhyped Disappointment[/h1] 
The developers were once known for experimenting with different genres. It’s a shame those experiments seem to have ended, and instead we got a game that could have easily been just a DLC (and in that case, there would’ve been no complaints).

The first Hades was a breakthrough title that showed for the first time that roguelikes can have high-quality narrative and storytelling — all wrapped in Supergiant Games’ signature art direction. For many people, the original Hades became the showcase of the action-roguelike genre and the entry point into it (myself included). Despite its click-click-dash combat, the game delivered a fresh and exciting experience.
What experience does Hades II offer? With such tedious combat and build-crafting, it can easily push players away from the genre entirely: “If the overhyped Hades II is this boring, then other roguelikes must be even worse.”

At first, I wanted to describe all the issues, but once I started writing, I realized I’d spend an enormous amount of time. It’s not worth it. There are already many great negative reviews with detailed examples and explanations. So here’s a short summary of the game’s problems:
[list]
[*]The combat became broader, but not deeper. Just like before — it’s simply click-click-dash.
[*]Battle balance is broken. Normal difficulty is extremely easy, while higher difficulty is absurd and tedious.
[*]The balance of boons and build-crafting is questionable. The dominant strategy is to pick the highest damage percentages for your basic or special attack and spam it. There are far too many useless boons.
[*]The Arcana system is dark-meta that effectively gets removed at high difficulty.
[*]Resource grind and the grind animations show no respect for the player’s time.
[/list]
What I simply disliked:
[list]
[*]The visual style
[*]The story feels childish, the characters are weak, and the developer-intended ending doesn’t match the dark and brutal tone of Greek mythology

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,29.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198064901750,"[h3]Good gameplay. Mediocre story.[/h3]

After the success of Hades, the idea of having Chronos, the titan of time, felt like the perfect villain for the style of game that had been created. A time wielding antagonist in a loop structured game seems like a match made in heaven. The problem is implementing it.

The game design and visuals are as good as the first game. It rewards you as you learn it. I love three of the new characters: Nemesis, Medea, and Scylla. Nemesis is so cool that sometimes I wonder if she would have been a better protagonist. Medea is another really cool character with a distinctive somber persona. Scylla and the sirens, what a remarkable boss. She is as memorable as Thesius. A charismatic foe that you love to hate. The best songs of the game come from her confrontation.

Some minor complaints and suggestions before the big one. The reagents and greeneries should be used for more enchantments and relationship progression. In the current state of the game, the majority of them are barely used, just keep filling up space, and are just a waste of time to collect once used. Supergiant could add incantations to the relationship system of the game instead of heavily relying on nectar and ambrosia. Melinoe could do strange and funny incantations she thinks might help her acquaintances, but which could backfire. She isn't as cheeky as Zagreus, but her naivete could be used to add some funny moments to the game. She could give some rare reagents and greeneries to Hecate, Circe, Medea, and maybe Arachne. She could give rare reagents to Icarus and Hephaestus. Give Persephone some greeneries. Her mother would love to receive flowers from her daughter. Mix things up. Not just give the same thing to everybody.

Most relationships in Hades 2 have a dissatisfying development and conclusion. The alliance with the Olympian gods plays exactly like the first game so they didn't feel anything special. A suggestion here would be Melinoe learn how to infuse nectars and ambrosias through incantations to please the gods. Sort of like the ectoplasmic draught she makes for Icarus. Different gods requiring different incantations. Regarding the relations with the other NPCs, there is a clear difference between Hades and Hades 2. Zagreus helps all those who help him throughout the game. It is extremely gratifying to interact with them. Melinoe in contrast just seems to meet them and become an acquaintance to most of them. Even if you advance all relationships in the game, she is just someone these people know and have to interact occasionally. There is no emotional benefit to befriending most characters. It is just something to unlock more dialogue. It is purely transactional. In the first Hades, it is so rewarding to help Achilles, your mentor and guy who has been encouraging you and being positive throughout the whole game. Dusa, Nyx, Sysiphus, Patroclus, Eurydice, Orpheus, Megaera, etc. It feels great meeting, talking, befriending, and helping them. There is nothing like that in Hades 2. Talking to the NPCs advances the story, but in the end there is barely any emotional attachment to most of them. Melinoe may meet lots of people, but she doesn't befriend or help most of them. Even the ones she helps end up in lackluster conclusion. Even her romance options end up being dull.

I did not like to face Cerberus as a boss. I love him in the first game. He is a source of comfort. I love when you first reach the final gate and instead of fighting him, you discover that you just need to give him a treat. You only see him in combat for a brief moment in the advanced final boss fight, which is hilarious (bad boy, bad boy!). In Hades 2, after having ""soothed"" Cerberus, I didn't even want to listen what Homer had to say. You turned a character that I loved in the first game into a character that I loathe having to face every single time I go to the Underworld. It makes no sense that he keeps getting corrupted even after you have freed Hades and Persephone.

If Chronos can imprison powerful characters like Zagreus, Persephone, and Hecate in those time bubbles; why doesn't he do that to Milenoe? This is a plot hole to me. In my head, I kept thinking how cool it would have been if Hecate had planned to make Milenoe's true identity to Chronos a secret because her main advantage would be that since she is directly related to him, his powers of time would not be reliable against her. Everyone who is directly related to Chronos would have this advantage. Only in later encounters he would deduce who she really is. I imagined him freezing her. After one or two seconds she frees herself, he shouts ""impossible!"", and the song ""In the Blood"" starts to play as the final fight progresses. But if I need to make mental gymnastics to justify your story, then there is definitely something wrong.

Now the big complaint. The first time I reached each of the endings of the first Hades it felt like bliss. When I reached the first ending of Hades 2, it just made the game worse and worse. It felt like some Kung Pow Enter the Fist type of joke, but done seriously.

Milenoe: I have diligently trained my entire life to kill the man who took my family away from me. I will never forgive him. Not in a million years. Never.
Zagreus: I implore you to reconsider.
Milenoe: Hmm... (in a high pitched voice) Okay. Hey grandpa, you are forgiven.

Chronos: For millennia, I painfully reconstituted myself after having been slain by my own children. Now it is my children's turn to suffer through my rightful revenge!
Zagreus: I implore you to reconsider.
Chronos: Hmm... (in a high pitched voice) Okay. Hey family, sorry.

Two tales of revenge. One from the protagonist and one from the antagonist. They both end in an awkward family reunion. That is bullshit. Shoving a happy ending when it isn't earned just left me with a huge feeling of disappointment. Every time I met with the reformed Chronos, I rolled my eyes. The post ending justification of having to battle other timelines is such a lazy excuse. The writer wrote himself into a corner and came up with this lousy trick. Suddenly we have a multiverse to fight for eternity. Give me a break.

If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be unsatisfying. After all those hours invested in this story, you are left with a pitifully weak ending. Then play more to reach the true ending, and it is another huge let down. The meeting with the Fates is extremely underwhelming. Just like waking up Hypnos. Then you get Hecate's reveal which is a convoluted time travel mess. It made me think what was the point of it all. What a waste of my time. I have occasionally reinstalled the first Hades a couple of times to beat it once again since it is so much fun. If I had to describe the first game in one word, it would be rewarding. After uninstalling Hades 2, I will probably never play it again. I paid full price in early access only because I bought the first game in a discount and loved it so much I promised I would pay full price for the next game.

If you are planning to buy this game, most likely you have played the first Hades. If you don't care much about the story and are only interested in the game mechanics or the speed running aspect, go for it. It is as good as the predecessor.

TLDR: Game's great, but feels subpar to SuperGiant's ridiculously high standards, so Hades1 - for coherent storytelling and consistency, Hades2 - for more diverse gameplay.

.. to elaborate:
- True & Epilogue Ending both are mediocre at best (the patch only made it a smidge better)
- just time-travel in general messing up the whole premise and post-game justifications
- some NPC arcs falling flat (Chronos, Hypnos)
- subplots going nowhere or lacking a satisfying resolution. Hades1 Sisyphus stayed for Boldy, Hades2 NPCs stay because of the ""NPC in a rogue-like"" reason - they can have it better, but none take the opportunity or, in some cases, even move (Tartatus couple).

.. the rest are nitpicks - outlandish style choices (suited Chaos; Dionysus's attire; the Oceanus boss - albeit entertaining but still too whimsical), tame weapon aspects (save for a few), flat God portraits (poses, not animations), boring +5% upgrades (Moon tree), ubiquitous status curses with similar effects.

The boss fights are pretty boring, are full of patched in after-thought mechanics, a-la the classic clone battle mechanic, the bosses are nowhere near as entertaining character-wise, the minions are kinda weird and kinda annoying, think Hades annoying minion mechanics x10, the maps I managed to play before becoming totally disgusted with the game are all reskinned versions of the originals with different names (and pasted in hazards that are not well flagged)... generally the whole thing feels underbuilt, like something solid has been stretched out and colorized through some kind of chemical process.

[b]The final insult for me was being perma-slowed in a forced cut-scene that reskins you as your character's child-self to relay some kind of very important who-knows-wtf about ?, hence, if follows of course, that you get a perma-slow and half-dash effect because it makes the bizarro segment authentic because of shorter legs? lol.

""Ugh, this isn't for me"" will be your thought through all of the dialogue and story beats.

[b]Young Adult[/b]: The premise is ""time killed my parents, so now I have to kill time in order to bring them back."" Obviously failure to kill time and acceptance of reality is the outcome, because teenagers are impressed by the lesson that people die of old age and resentment of that makes no sense.

[b]For Girls[/b]: Your character is a teenage girl going through a very teenage girl arc. She's born into privilege (surrounded by mentors and admirers, royal lineage), so she has all of the tools she needs to be successful. She's even turned those tools into talent. But ugh, she'll never be good enough in her own eyes. She begins solving every problem with ""but I'm not good enough to try and solve this problem!""

She needs (and gets) constant reassurances and you-got-this from every role model in her life. Even when someone scolds her, it's just positive reinforcement couched in a scolding tone. ""Melinoe cease your self deprecation at once. I'll have none of this self doubt, especially not from you of all people! I know you can beat me, and I feel deep down you know it too! Now get up and try again!""

So her quest is learning to accept the fact that she IS GOoD enough, dammit!

This is not something we go through as guys. But my understanding is  ""stop doubting yourself and try"" is a very common lesson learned in ladyland.

[h1]Gameplay Doesn't Hit that Button that Hades Did[/h1]

It plays similarly enough. 

Issues for me are TONS of upgrade systems that require futzing with menus all day. 

I'm 5 weapons deep and none of them feels as fun as any of the weapons in Hades did. ""Slow and clunky"" is the theme, even for ""fast"" weapons. And each time I try a special or a charge attack, my feeling is ""oh, that's it?""

Every character wants to talk constantly. So you finish a run, then you get those ""talk to me"" exclamation points above everyone's head. And because of my story points above, going through them all to make sure I unlock more gameplay is a chore.

There is a boss called Scylla. A group of Sirens in a rock band. Fun on paper. In practice, their music is corny teenage edgelord pop, so it grates on my nerves that I'm hearing it halfway through every run.

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,29.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561198034460612,"The short review is: play the first game, it's awesome. This one's a lame copy. 

The long one is: I really wanted to love this game. The first one was one of the best games I've ever played and I've played a lot. However, I simply can't. And for many reasons: 

1. One of the finest characteristics of the first game was how balanced it was. Each weapon had some advantages, same for the gods. And none was truly broken. You had to do your best. Now... Well, now there are many broken combos. And you don't even need them. Just get a Selene damaging boon, improve it, get loads of life and nothing else matters. You can one-shot each phase of the final boss with it. And with enough life you don't really need to bother too much with his attacks. No strategy or ability required. This game is way easier than the first without being more interesting.
2. This game pretends to have more options, but they are not really options. For instance, would you rather have three extra lives or deal more damage to enemies with two curses? Most of the options you have are either super powerful or mostly useless. For instance, one of the challenges of the game is to manage you mana consumption. However you can choose to start with a powerful mana regen, which makes mana management moot.
3. Far too many resources, most of which are used once or twice, then become irrelevant. The game itself knows it and at some point gives you a magic that makes you not even have to gather them. 
4. The conversations are boring. There are far too many characters and you have to give far too many gifts to each of them, and your reward is too listen to same sentence with different words. Besides, almost everyone is super nice ever since the beginning. There's no drama and no evolution to the characters. The gods even apologize when you spurn them.
5. Most of the characters are very tedious. The headmistress is a fortune cookie sentence generator. Odysseus only alerts you to things that you already know. (By the gods! The skeleton has better advice.) Very few characters have something interesting to say.
6. The love interests are lame. Two weak, apologetic men. (One of them actually apologizes to you for having only you as a lover while you have a lot of people.) One woman hates you and does everything she can to make your life worse. (Really? That's the one the main character is going after!?) Only the other woman has a nice story and doesn't seem a lame lover.
7. The antagonist could be easily swapped by Doc. Evil, given how cliche he is. And the ending (both of the main story and the epilogue) are super boring. 

The only saving grace was Scylla. The idea of a boss that sings different songs throughout her level is awesome. And her songs are much more interesting than the bgm of the rest of the game.

All in all, this was not a good sequence to the first. Having played Silksong recently, the difference in quality is glaring. Whereas in Silksong the creators clearly learned from the first game and made an even better one, in this game no lessons were learned. In fact, there were many downgrades that I simply cannot understand. 

For instance, when checking a god's boon list, in the first game you could see simultaneously both the requirements and the details of the boon. Now you can see only one or the other. Who thought this would be better? On the first, after you finished the main quest, the ending of a run was a lighthearted joke on the protagonist. Now we have only a boring generic ending. Is the protagonist so soft skinned that she can't take a joke?

My take on this game is that this game was not thoroughly thought before its implementation and that early access made it worse instead of better. The loudest people usually ask for a less challenging game and for more OP characters, which can be fun for a little while but make for a much less enjoyable game.

For instance, the last weapon to be created requires no brain to play. Just spam super specials and that's it. Super boring. I did the 32 darkness challenge with it at the beginning of the game without breaking a sweat. This should not happen. In the end, the hardest challenge is to play the super random challenge, where you may end with the lamest weapon and worse enemy boosts. Not fun at all.

Armed initially with nothing but a rock, one becomes acutely aware that this primitive tool is not merely a means of gathering resources, but a symbol of humanity’s eternal struggle against entropy. The island itself operates as a living ecosystem of paranoia, where each footstep behind you triggers a sudden philosophical inquiry into mortality.

What truly distinguishes Rust is its uniquely volatile social dynamic. Alliances form and dissolve with the same instability as subatomic particles, and the concept of trust becomes a rare and precious hallucination. The player must navigate a landscape saturated with Machiavellian scheming, economic desperation, and a level of unpredictable human behavior that borders on the anthropological. A single encounter with another player can unravel hours of effort, transforming personal progress into an existential tragedy worthy of Greek theatre.

The emotional turbulence Rust generates is unparalleled. Triumph feels mythic—your first fortified base stands not merely as a structure, but as a monument to defiance against an uncaring universe. Conversely, being raided at 3 a.m. by a clan of sleep-deprived marauders is a humbling reminder of the cosmos’s disdain for your ambitions. This perpetual oscillation between empowerment and devastation makes Rust an experience not of simple entertainment, but of psychological endurance.

In conclusion, Rust is a hyper-chaotic meditation on survival, cruelty, and the volatile nature of human interaction. It is exhausting, awe-inspiring, and occasionally soul-crushing, but it is unquestionably one of the most brutally honest reflections of human behavior ever disguised as a game.",True,0,0,1764193372,N/A,Steam

Rust is a survival game that excels at one thing above all else: punishing its players. From the moment you spawn on the beach with nothing but a rock and a dream, the game makes it very clear that it owes you absolutely nothing—and it delivers on that promise relentlessly.

The learning curve is steep and often brutal. Crafting, building, raiding, monument puzzles, electricity, recoil control—Rust provides little instruction and expects you to figure things out the hard way. For some, that’s part of the charm. For others, it’s an exhausting uphill battle with no payoff in sight.

Rust’s community is another hurdle. The proximity and voice chat systems, while innovative, often serve as gateways to some of the most toxic interactions in online gaming. Trash talk, harassment, and trolling are commonplace, and unless you disable communication entirely, you’re likely to experience the worst of it.

The game is also a massive time sink. Bases decay unless maintained, raids can happen while you sleep, and servers wipe regularly, erasing your progress and requiring you to start over. To stay competitive, many players feel pressured to commit long, continuous sessions—something not everyone has the time or desire for.

Even if you can stomach the gameplay loop, technical performance might still stand in your way. Rust demands a powerful PC, and even then, it’s prone to frame dips, long loading times, and occasional instability.

Finally, playing solo is a challenge bordering on masochistic. Rust heavily favors groups, and lone players often find themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and outmatched.

In short: Rust is a game that rewards perseverance but punishes everything else. If you’re looking for a harsh, unforgiving survival experience and don’t mind the toxicity or time commitment, Rust can be incredible. But for many players, the difficulty, community, and grind make it an easy pass.",True,0,0,1764181995,N/A,Steam

Rust,252490,39.99,0,multiplayer/co-op,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG",76561199111640796,"I absolutely love the concept of this game, but recent updates by the developers don't make sense and are lackluster, I believe this game is being mismanaged.

**jungle update**
  - doesn't make sense gameplay-wise, tier 0 biome right next to spawn beach yet has wildly unfair animal AI compared to other biomes
  - doesn't offer any monuments other than ziggarat, it looks cool, but offers almost nothing for the amount of risk you have to go through.
**meta shift**
  - slows down progression (people complained that it's too fast) by adding blueprint fragments to various puzzles
  - kind of works on low pop, a lot of players from my server complain that it's not fun to obtain
  - you will be prim-locked forever as a solo / small team on high pop.
  - fragments serve no purpose afterwards if you already have the corresponding workbench
  - imo they tackled the wrong thing, they should've done something about unlocks, not workbenches
**pivot or die**
  - made tech tree costs stupidly low (why? didn't you just slow down progression?)
  - removed workbench taxes by default (this is something that i believe should've been experimented with, reward players for finding items in-world with noticeable cost reductions, rather than completely locking them out of workbenches and then suddenly making lucky players with workbenches be able to progress at mach 4)
**naval update**
  - not out, but so far from staging branch seems like it'll have the same issue like the jungle biome where there's not enough value for the amount of effort and risk you have to go through to reach and stay afloat in the deep sea

it just seems like they're changing stuff just for the sake of change and that they've ran out of ideas. although i've never played during this era, i believe that rust's content updates had more vision under Garry's leadership. every update served a purpose whereas a lot of newer updates under Alistair's leadership don't add anything interesting or even actively harm the game. there's also been a lot more focus on monetization to the point where I feel like I'm playing a F2P game, P2W items exist, they allow you to do things normal players can't do, there is literally a hazmat that changes stats for money. servers owners also lose a lot of control over their own servers with new EULA changes, you cannot even the odds between players by giving P2W items in any way (loot tables, ability to craft, etc) as a server owner, you cannot restrict players with P2W items from using them for any reason at all either, it's not a good look and just sucks for people who dislike having to spend money on microtransactions to compete on a game that's they've already paid for.

optimization is also another issue, it uses an absurd amount of VRAM (6GB for eighth resolution, which is the lowest graphics preset) for a game that doesn't look as good as others which consume less memory, this could be a unity limitation for all i know but this is absurd and it was never this bad when i played a year ago. it also uses a ton of memory in general and 16GBs is not something you should be playing with. recent updates have also added a lot of buggy code and constant client errors which aren't seemingly being addressed.

i also want to express my concerns about Linux support, as it would be really nice if you allowed EAC to work under Proton, it's a single checkbox that you can tick in the EOS dashboard and shipping linux EAC binaries. I know it's weaker but would it be that bad considering that most servers already moderate suspicious players? It won't stop me from playing as I've created a non-EAC server alongside a friend that's marginally successful, but it would be a nice gesture from Facepunch.

you've created an awesome game that I personally enjoy, there's nothing like it anywhere else in the entire game's industry but it has so many flaws that I cannot recommend it to new-comers in this state.",False,1,0,1763999930,N/A,Steam

SUPERHOT,322500,7.49,0,solo,"Action, Indie",76561198060854250,"While I typically avoid FPS games, SUPERHOT caught my eye because of its presentation. It's a bullet time game where time only moves when you do, and even with this huge advantage you're constantly having to think on your feet in close ranged combat.

A part of why this works so well is that the game is a puzzle as much as it is a FPS. Every level places you in a difficult situation that they need to figure out with moment to moment reactions. You also die very easily, so it's about trial and error until a working strategy prevails.

I feel that this initially had the potential to be one of the best games I've played, even for something outside of my typical preferred genres. However, the way the story presents itself is a bit flawed, as it's far too intrusive to the actual gameplay from the getgo. I know some people will argue that's the point, but I don't want to ever replay the game exactly because of this. I feel there are better ways that the story could have been executed without sacrificing too much of the gameplay itself. If the message is supposed to be that the gameplay is addictive, then let me experience that!

I still like SUPERHOT, the gameplay itself is intuitive. A minimalist style and mechanics to focus purely on the bullet time aspect makes for a memorable, albeit not perfect, experience. I'd suggest just getting this on sale due to the shorter playtime, although the franchise as a whole is probably not worth checking out unless if you [i]really[/i] find the core gameplay to look interesting.",True,1,0,1763926852,N/A,Steam

Although this game is flawless with no complaints, I must say that in my opinion the concept of SuperHot: where time moves when you move. is better executed in VR. I had so much more fun in the VR version because SuperHot’s gameplay is smoother and better done in VR than in the original.

Also, with how short these games are, I don’t find real value in the $25 price tag for each of them. The VR version is by far worth its price, while the original feels lacking because its Gameplay and Difficulty is just stale in comparison.

Now, I do want to make this clear: SuperHot is not bad. It is wonderful and a joy to play through, and I can see some people justifying the $25 price tag. I just think that when you compare it to SuperHot VR, its price isn’t worth it to me personally.

I bought this for about $8, and I’m happy with it, but I would not pay the full $25 price. If you can buy this game on sale, then I’d say it’s worth your time and money. However, I believe that SuperHot VR is the definitive and better version to play.",True,0,0,1763873488,N/A,Steam

[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end.[/i]
 
~
 
There I was, in a stairwell I assumed would be my end.
Two men with guns were coming up from below, and someone is right next to me about to punch my lights out.
In the blink of an eye I grab a nearby fire extinguisher and throw it at the nearest man, then follow up with a flurry of blows that sends him to the red-guy shadow realm.
Picking up a hammer, I throw it at the first gunman, mankind him fall back and drop his gun.
Leaping out, his buddy shoots at me - but I twitch faster than a speeding bullet, like something out of the matrix.
I punch the first gunman as he tries to pick up his gun - his buddy from behind BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF trying to shoot [b]ME[/b]
In a flash, I grab the gun as it tumbles through the air, turning it around and putting a round into the head of the second assailant.
Three more red guys spawn in - guns drawn.
I throw my pistol at mach 5, hitting one and rupturing his internal organs. Guy behind him readies a shot - I don’t think so.
I TRANSPORT MY CONSCIOUSNESS into that guy’s body, leaving the meat puppet I was originally controlling to fall over in a state of fatal neural shock and overheat.
In the new body I toss the butt of the rifle at my closest enemy, grab that guy’s shotgun, blow away the final guy.

How could anyone not think this game is awesome.

I’ve played this game for ~8 hours on my XBOX and loved it - popping it open on [i]Steam[/i] let me fall in love with the game all over again. With a total of 26 hours playing [b]SUPERHOT[/b] at time of writing, I can easily recommend.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3602436808
To temper expectations against what everyone else is hyping the experience up for - the only thing you do is shoot red guys. Nothing more.
There are a few little minigames, the story is interesting, and the style is both creative and unique. The title is overall charming.

There isn’t a globe trotting adventure, tons of different mechanics, dynamic dialogue trees, loads of rewards or cosmetics, etc.

But if the core gameplay loop looks like something you’d like, it will repay your curiosity in dividends. Even though red dude’s heads explode and they shatter into glass, the game is generally clean enough to play around teens - it’s good fun and a lot of adventure - very well made, and you are given tons of secrets and challenges to test that noodle of yours after you’re done with the main helping this experience has to offer.

The game is short, sweet, and basically a super tricked out tech demo or proof-of-concept slice.

While the gameplay is cool I quickly got frustrated with each reset I initiated. We got couple of stuff at our disposal, depending on the level, be it weapons or objects and later on an ability to switch bodies, so there are couple of ways we can clear the level. 
Game quickly became a puzzle instead of a shooter. With each reset, I knew more possibilities of approaching threats but it wasn't for a better. Five tries here, switching approach, another two tries there, switch, different tactic, here I couldn't make it, there I was not quick enough. That's not for me to have an multiverse gameplay in my world, maybe its my brain that Im capable of seeing all the possibilities and none at the same time so Im stuck 5 times in one confrontation before I switch to different threat or progress further.

SUPERHOT,322500,7.49,0,solo,"Action, Indie",76561199090442791,"This game has a pretty cool concept but that's about it. in my opinion this game is simply way too overhyped. The story is shorter than 90 minutes, 60 if you are hurrying, 30 if you barely make a mistake and 15m 52s 107ms if you are the world record holder. 

First of all, the story is just trash, constantly pretending like you are helpless and a slave to the Virus, when in reality literally nothing changes. I can't write what I think? That's been there from the beginning! I can't exit the game? Yes I can, just press the windows button or any of the fifteen shortcuts, that close the game. You are also not really forced to obey, ratehr being ""You have to"" and then not actually doing anything. Making me bored is not forcing me.

But lets look at the shooter part instead: It is pretty okay but over all it's short once you figure out how to play, most levels are pretty easy but the game gives you the illusion of difficulty by spawning enemies behind you with no way of knowing unless you died to them before and even if, you probably don't know it was them since there is no way to know what killed you. They also walk like they are completely drunk, making aiming a nightmare sometimes. The weapons are pretty boring, I like the Gun the most, since it is just simple and fitting for such a game, you can shoot, you can throw, once it's out, no more shooting for you. Punching is also pretty fun but completely ruins the point of the bat, the corwbar and the katana which are all (more or less) the same. The spread weapons are pretty trash, why would i need a spread weapon in a game where i have all the time in the world to move and am often punished for getting close? There is also a weapon that if you shoot, shoots 4 times and fast, again, why do i need that? It feels so much more unprecise if there are more bullets, just make it fire one bullet. Lastly the throwing items are pretty fun, although enemies only get stunned from them unless you hurl like 10 at them.
Lastly, you have the ability to ""take control of them"" which is just a lie and actually means: ""You teleport to the point where the enemy was standing and kill him but have no weapon now"". It sounds pretty fun but it's stale quickly since instead of landing a cool shot in slow Motion or managing to get to the guy and punching him to pieces, you just pressed a button and it feels like no impact at all. A better Version would have been to control the red guy for a little bit, using his weapons and fighting the other guys before switching back to yourself instead of how they handled it.

The game is also far too short for being this price, even discounted I don't really find it worth it. If you played through the story, there are challenges which are pretty much playing the story again but with a specific weapon.

You can also rewatch your gameplay after a level, which would be pretty cool, if it wouldn't look so goofy at full speed, was shrunken down, had the worlds most ugliest effect over it and the robotic voice that is capable of less words than Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy: ""Super Hot"".

I actually have no problem with the grafics, I think it fits pretty well. The maps could have really used more veriety, the windows for example are pretty cool, having something in the map that is interactable.

If you still like the slow Motion shooting and want the game just for that, Time Shooter 2 on crazy games is probably your best option since instead of handing over your life savings, you can play the slightly worse version for free. On top of that, you don't need to suffer through this half-assed story.

If you couldn't tell, I kind of don't like the game but that is just my opinion, if you want to make your own, don't forget that you can refund games if you didn't play them for more than 2 hours and didn't own them for more than 2 weeks.",False,4,2,1741194868,N/A,Steam

SUPERHOT,322500,7.49,0,solo,"Action, Indie",76561198165114954,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

[b]TL;DR:[/b] I wouldn't describe this game as a shooter but rather a puzzle game - which is something I can appreciate but unfortunately the game fails incredibly to feel rewarding due to the missing demand of sophisticated solutions. The level design and enemy placement is so trivial that it gets fairly hard to fail.


[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Fantastic idea for a puzzle game
[*] Challenges and Endless mode do provide challenges - unfortunately in a fairly repetitive manner
[*] Modest visuals
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Insanely annoying noises as well as voices
[*] Disgusting visuals and transitions between levels or within the Options
[*] The entire game is basically an infinite flash bang and you most likely have to select a low brightness mode on your monitor
[*] Gameplay loop is very repetitive and boring
[*] Fails to be a proper puzzle game (see TL;DR above)
[*] It is rather hard to read the movement of your enemies. Their entire body can scream they are about to change directions by 90° and proceed to not to while at the same time other enemies run towards you in full sprint, just to stop in an instant and run backwards without some kind of inertia. To be fair you can do the same. But once this mechanic is combined with the extremely slow bullet speed in comparison to movements it actually is one of the few shooter where I do struggle to hit headshots. Enemies may do a step or not. They may change directions or not. So instead of a potential fantastic puzzle game you get a very tedious enemy check. ""Did I hit enemy 1? Did I hit enemy 2? Did I hit enemy 3? ..."" over and over again.
[*] Story is fairly bland and barely existent
[*] Performance is meh ~140fps but you also don't really need more

Best of 1 format with no alternative queue for best of 3
Low rank ha sproblem with smurf
The winner is chosen by a coin toss, sometimes you draw the out but you still have to wait for 30 min cutscene turn
Casual mode exist and it's, maybe, worse then ranked
Team mode is a total waste of code and space
New archetype are all UR, still free to play but the greed is undeniable
New, and old, accessories are not polished
Custom room don't have custom rules, for example N/R event, Goat, Edison ...
Events sometimes are very good (N/R and Dungeon Dice), most of the times are ""Play the archetype in the last pack""
Some archetype are chosen to be the meta for 6 months with minimal hits on the banlist, or even without a single hit, beacause ""lore"" while other (Almost all TCG native archetype) are born to be trash
Alternative arts cannot be crafted, the first time they were introduced you could, now komoney say you have to pay to pull

This game is strictly for competitive players, if you wanna play for fun, play with friends or stop at gold rank

First of all, if a game has this many ""must have"" generic staples, they should be easy to get, and not be f****** URs, are you kidding me? And UR drops are so rare that by the time I time I collect enough dust for the playset of all of the must-play handtraps I already lost interest. Unlike in Hearthstone, each rarity uses separate dust, which means you need to actually pull URs to craft URs.

Around 25% of your deck is either generic handtraps everyone plays or counters to these handtraps, so it's not even like these expensive cards you're crafting are resulting in building cooler decks. They also don't give you more fun play experience either. It's like a nuclear race: both sides are forced to stockpile their decks with the most powerful weapons to keep up with the other side, even though the end result sucks for both of them.

On the plus side, the visuals and OST are fantastic.

- Yu-Gi-Oh card simulation seems smooth. 
- Music is good.
- Highlights relevant card text for various effects. 
- Some event duels create new metas outside the traditional ranked.

- Story mode content is basically a nice looking power point.
- In App account management between devices is a dumpster fire. (Do not play on any device before linking up your account. There is no simple log out button.) 
- Once event duels end, there is no meaningful way in game to engage with casual play. 
- Game locks packs of various archetypes, and you can only purchase these various types of packs by generating a card from that 'set' or using gems (earnable, but still a paid currency.) to hopefully pull an SR from the set. Which then allows you to spend gems on the set you are actually aiming for.

[h1]I love Yugioh, but it does have flaws.[/h1]
My problem with Yugioh is actually the problem that it's basically the card game version of a fighting game. In my previous group, I was in the middle. The person above me would basically always win easily and I felt bad. The person below me would always lose to me even when I'm running the absolute funniest Amazement Traptrix deck you've ever seen, and like next level it'd be too easy to beat and they'd feel EXTREMELY bad. Is the solution just to play worse? I accidentally bullied my friends out of playing the game with me by playing the game it's very sad.

[u]This game has that problem to the extreme.[/u]

What's something you know about Yugioh?
It's that it's a best of 3 format, right? You see who goes first and then after the win people get a chance to use the side deck and pick for themselves if they go first or not. That means even if your deck does a flash in the pan instant win on game one, there's a chance you just straight up lose in the next two rounds because your opponent outplayed you with their backup cards or now that they know what you're actually doing, hand-trapping the correct cards. Or, your opponent doesn't draw any hand traps and only gets their starters and bricks and you win for free anyway [i]let's save that for another time...[/i]
But Master Duel is not that. Master Duel is a best of one. You go on the latter, you lose the coin flip, give up honestly it's over requeue to make it faster. Maybe if you had hand traps? Oh no sorry the best decks now resist hand traps anyway so like yeah just stop trying. There's one hand trap they can't resist but uh, we'll get to that at the very end.

You might wonder why I had so little playtime. I basically ruined the game for myself.
If you somehow didn't notice despite the fact you reading this are probably someone who actually spent a lot more time in the game, anything you want to play is all URs. Everything is URs. In the past you would have most of your main combo be SRs, some URs are the one-off boss monsters in the extra or something like that, and then MOST of your URs are the hand traps you run in every deck. That's nice, you only need to get the [i]really expensive[/i] high rarity cards that you'll just put into every profile to make them at the bare level playable in this landscape.
[u]I played ghostricks and doll monsters. I spent all of my currency on those two decks and I only got the full deck for one of them, but not even the hand traps since I didn't know they existed because when I played it was my first time with Yugioh ever.[/u]
You HAVE to know in advance the good cards in Yugioh normally, kinda sucks but whatever I guess. Uh so I did permanent account damage to myself for pulling fully on a pack that I thought was cool and then never got the really really really good auto-include cards because nothing and nobody ever told me they were even a thing. The tutorial certainly didn't explain to me, ""Make sure to craft some hand traps before heading out!""
Ghostrick also isn't a good deck. So what would it take if I, today, for some reason wanted to get right back into the game and play the new meta?

34 URs.

[h1]Excuse me, what?[/h1]
In order to keep the sun in the sky shining or something, Konami has decided now that every single new archetype that comes out now is all URs. All of them, every single one, with the SRs being leftover cards from the past still relevant today, like idk 3 rares? If even? And then the only common card, one copy, in the entire profile is the archetypal trap card. I don't think I need to explain why that's extremely bad. I'll give my personal example of how bad that is in a second but let me sideline with something about balance here since I did say the whole ""every match is a coinflip"" and you might be wondering why.

[h2]So yes, the current meta is Maliss[/h2]
They are extremely expensive and blah blah. What really upsets me is the fact they are the strongest. Master Duel most often gets their content drops last, after TCG and OCG. OCG gets pack reveals and their cards first, meaning there's room for issues and stuff with the random cards and stuff people get excited for yeah that's fine. TCG usually gets the same cards with some TCG exclusives months later, with content from the OCG redefining what happens in these packs allowing it to be more fair and fun for everyone. Sometimes, let's not forget the Bonfire incident. But in general that's multiple months to prepare for the next release basically using OCG as a testing ground.

Master Duel had so long to wait for Maliss. They had all the time in the world to see the deck was outperforming the competition and making people sad or mad and such. With all this extra time, they could prepare for the release by maybe like straight up holding off some of the cards from the deck until later? Like straight up not even print Dormouse (not a real suggestion but an example) so that the deck can exist but is in such an underpowered state that it will not ruin everything that exists here. It's a digital game, they control all fictional copies of cards and their availability. They could even have cards limited or semi-limited on release if they really wanted to. People would feel weird about it but they could've done anything.
So then can someone please explain to me why they still decided to release Maliss, full power, and it has dominated the meta of this game for I believe over four months now???? Are you actually kidding me? Is it so hard to just not have done that? Does releasing it in full power actually print that much money? It probably does because as I explained, decks are way too expensive to make now. Speaking of:

If I burn my entire collection, I most likely won't even get halfway there. Okay how about a less powerful deck like Diabellestar? Mix it with White Forest and Azamina, the full lore strategy, sounds pretty fun!
If I was crazy enough to not wanna do the default good cards you always include, I just wanted the playable cards for the actual deck of Diabell, it would STILL BE [b]28[/b] ULTRA RARE CARDS.
Like, if I destroyed literally every single card I've ever pulled from packs, I wouldn't even have enough just to make the bare essentials like Ash Blossom, Crossout, Called By, Fuwalos or

[h1]Maxx 'C'[/h1]
Big shock, I hate the card. I think it makes the game objectively worse.
""OCG has it and they're fine!"" Best of 3 format. Do not. They don't even like the card themselves either! If you've ever bothered asking them, most OCG players actually despise it probably MORE than us because unlike TCG players, they actually do have to deal with it!
They at the very least have a chance to survive it, with a best of 3 format that makes it sometimes possible [i]not[/i] to draw it. They really have so much going against them already but they can at least play the game over there.
Not over here! If you get Maxx 'C'ed, you have only the one round of this one game match to beat your opponent. Better pack it up, this isn't a coin flip on just who goes first anymore, it's an additional coin flip on who resolved Maxx 'C'. You finally got to go first, but your opponent baited your Called By with Fuwalos and now gets to Maxx 'C' you? Tough shit, game is over. You can probably play like 3 cards and realize your opponent got better pot of greed into ash + imperm + nibiru + called by for their turn and you auto lose. Congrats. Oh so your opponent got to do basically full combo even through your hand traps and now its your turn, but they Maxx 'C' you off the top? It's over. Break their board and let them pick up their entire deck, sure.
9/10 times Maxx 'C' resolves, the game is already decided.

However, this game has been recently plagued by some pretty annoying issues. I was never one for pvp, anytime the devs try to make serious changes to pvp the loud minority of player wine until the meta is reestablished. The current issue with pvp in sea of thieves is not that it is hard but that it is boring, the tactics are flushed out and all battle basically devolve into get on their ship and drop the anchor. The second big issue is the player base in general, every time I play the game i either am fighting someone screaming racial slurs, a literal child, or someone with the pvp skins who have clearly played more hours then me. Now I know what your thinking just get gud, play more hours and pvp, well here's the thing I don't want to and apparently considering the dwindling player count no one else does either. Even if I did I pretty much run into cheaters every time I play. Alternatively rare has included a team sever mode, which is great but due to the how much your loot drops are nerfed combined with no multipliers that mode isn't very fulfiling. This caused the player spike when the mode was released to be very short lived. Not to mention the most recent tall tales sucked.

Cheaters, sweats, and murder hobos ruined pvp
hour glass is full of cheaters
PVP is to linear and always plays the same
A team server that is less restrictive would actually sustain the player spike
PVP players will argue that the game got worse when the solo mode was added, they are lying it is a disingenuous argument that suits their desire to fight someone who doesn't want to. There were large player spikes when the mode was added and the main complaint was it was to restrictive, the less restrictive form nerfed loot drops and did not allow for meaningful progression. 
Would I recommend this game, nope, games player count is on the decline and unlike in season 4 solo slooping no longer feels doable.",False,2,0,1763437895,N/A,Steam

Beautiful game on the eyes and whatever optimization they did recently is great for the framerate and overall smoothness of the game itself, but between the horrid player base (weve all been chased down for a few cannonballs and bananas, havent we?) and the game itself not really working half the time, its not worth the price tag it comes with and its most certainly not worth the price tag of the trinkets and knicknacks and season passes.

Sekiro,814380,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198982758610,"Sekiro isn’t just a great game—it’s a triumph of design, storytelling, and craftsmanship. FromSoftware took the soul of their signature difficulty and forged it into something faster, tighter, and more exhilarating than anything they’d made before. The result? A game that doesn’t just challenge you—it transforms you.

From the moment you pick up the sword, Sekiro becomes a dance. Every clash, every deflection, every perfectly timed parry feels like a spark of lightning in your hands. Unlike other action games, Sekiro doesn’t let you hide behind shields or overpowered builds. It demands mastery, discipline, and patience. And when you finally get it, the game opens up in the most rewarding way possible. Few gaming moments compare to breaking an enemy’s posture and landing that final, devastating deathblow—it’s pure satisfaction.

The world of Ashina is equally stunning. From misty temple forests to burning castles and mythical mountains, every area feels alive and purposeful. The vertical movement, grappling hook traversal, and stealth options give the world a sense of depth that makes exploration genuinely thrilling. You don’t just walk from place to place—you swoop, climb, stalk, and strike.

Sekiro’s story, though quieter than most, hits with surprising emotional weight. Wolf’s journey is simple on the surface—save your young lord—but the bonds, betrayals, and moral choices woven into the narrative give every moment gravity. It’s a tale about loyalty, honor, and the weight of legacy, told with elegance and restraint.

Bosses are where Sekiro truly becomes legendary. Each one is a test of everything you’ve learned: Genichiro tightening your fundamentals, the Guardian Ape shocking you with unexpected chaos, Isshin pushing you to your absolute limits. They’re not just fights—they’re iconic encounters that stay with you long after the credits roll.

Sekiro is not an easy game, but it is a fair one. It respects the player. It teaches without words. And when you finally overcome the impossible, it rewards you with a sense of triumph few games can match.

It’s not just one of FromSoftware’s best—it’s one of the greatest action games ever made. A masterpiece of precision, passion, and unforgettable moments.",True,0,0,1763916856,N/A,Steam

For me there's just too many frustrating issues with this game.

___GAMEPLAY____

First off, there's very little choice in how you engage with the combat or the world. It's one of the most linear games I've played in a long while. 

How the game GENERALLY work is as follows, you, the player, will enter an area, where there's a set number of enemies, you can't really attack multiple enemies at once, since they'll just gang up on you immediately, so 1-on-1 is definitely preferred, occasionally you can deal a couple of the weaker enemies at the same time, but generally you definitely want to sneak around and stealth kill.

The stealth is half baked and feels on rails, sometimes enemies can spot you a mile away and run ALL the way to you, other times you can shank a friend of theirs 5 meters to their right and they'd be none the wiser. It really depends on if you stealth kill the enemies in the correct sequence. This can be a very lengthy process and you're gonna do this A LOT in each area.

The combat is too much waiting and either parry/jump/dodge (except dodge is super nerfed in this game) depending on the attack animation. You have very little agency in controlling the battles you are almost only reacting and never acting, it's like one long randomized QTE you have to endure. This is to the point where the miniboss battles I did endure to beat was not enjoyable or fun but just a chore. 

Miniboss? you ask, why yes, there's two kinds of hard enemies, afaik, minibosses and then regular bosses, the regular bosses will give you a small boost to your attack stat (btw, there's no allocation of rpg stats in this game, so forget about ""builds"") now minibosses are probably gonna take up most of your time, they're basically very difficult enemies with a series of attack patterns that you need to learn 100% or else you'll just die. Mostly you need to learn to deflect when the correct animation plays (which is the vast, VAST majority of combat) to the point it feels like you're playing a rhythm game.

Now a lot of the combat is supposed to be about reading the animation and reacting accordingly, but do you know what's constantly blocking the camera from clearly seeing the enemy that you're up close to? that's right the player character itself. Then there's the camera who will spazz out when you're in tight corners. and sometimes just not lock on to the enemy RIGHT NEXT to you, and in an easier game I could forgive that, totally, but not when the punishment for death is as high as it is. 

Whenever you die, and you will die, a lot, you lose half your money and a lump portion of xp, which can't be retrieved, it's just gone. Then there's the dragonrot where if you die enough times, which you will, npcs will stop helping you, so you have to spend extra money to fix it in order to progress a story line.

____STORY AND LORE____

Then there's the story and lore, I do think there's something interesting about this world and how so many of it's inhabitants are obsessed with immortality, especially the undead monks, were really cool.

But I don't care about the main character and his lord (a twelve year old boy with magic resurrection blood), really none of the characters are of any interest to me, except maybe the Carver and the undead training dummy, they're kindda funny. 

____Overall____
And that's really the issues I have overall with the game, I'm not interested in getting better in a game, that I have so little stake in. I don't care about the characters or what's gonna happen next to them, the world itself is kindda cool, but not enough to warrant the ungodly amount of hours I'd have to invest in order to ""git gud"".",False,2,1,1763217845,N/A,Steam

All enemies are new which surprised me and i don't expect originality coming from fromsoft. The game does feel good to play when it all works, and it looks like there is a cool idea beneath the bad stuff.

Bad stuff: 60 fps locked in current year. If a mod can easily bypass this, then this can be added by devs. For me this is enough of a dealbreaker on its own. The option menu is abysmal, and although performance is not as atrocious as Elden Ring, it's unacceptable for a game that looks as this one does.

Posture system is a neat idea but in reality it doesn't. Your own posture barely matters, most enemies can't punish a posture break and it takes less than 2 seconds to recover by just holding block. On bosses it matters but not as much as damage. You can kill a boss by depleting the posture, but for posture to not deplete fast, you need to deal damage first. So it ends up feeling like posture damage doesn't matter for a good chunk of the fight, and then damage doesn't matter. I get the idea but it's badly executed.

Farming is waaaay too encouraged. If you have a ton of experience you are encouraged to farm till your next level or you risk too much if you die. Gold pouches seem like a system that only feels bad. You don't feel smart for paying the 10% tax to save your gold, losing it feels bad, using the pouches feels bad. It's not like gold is super necessary, it's just there to make you feel bad about dying. More than a soulslike. XP tree is bloated with things just to encourage farming. Shinobi tool upgrades require a ton of materials that are rare drops on specific mobs. There are literally consumables to help you farm. Why not like, remove this entirely from the game? It adds nothing and makes everything feel worse. You even have to farm your revives, so you'll be attempting a boss, you don't have your 2/3 revives, you need to go out, kill some trash to farm your revives, to go back to the boss and lose the xp and gold you gathered while farming.

Which gets us to the next point. The trial and error is replaced by a easier game where you are punished a lot for failing. Consumables are super op, tools are op, revives are op, you get too much healing. You can pretty much bulldoze your way through the game as intended; or you can try to learn bosses, try to defeat them cleanly and meanwhile feel that the game is angry at the way you want to enjoy playing it. At least dragon rot was partially removed from the game, holy shit, what a dumb mechanic, it's like these people forget all the mistakes they already made, insane that it didn't get completely removed.

Quests and story as incomprehensible as ever, but if you like following a guide to get the endings power to you. Exploration is a bit messed up with places getting up to 3 different states and loot shifting around, but that's not a biggy.

Bosses are pretty good for the most part, really low amount of bullshit, even if you are trying to properly learn them. Barring a couple of bosses that go against the main design of the game and are just tanks you have to hit 300 times and you are discouraged from parrying. It's like they have a dumb ideas for bosses quota and they need to hit it.

Amazing! Combine that with brain-dead simplistic stealth and overly punishing one hit enemies and you have a casserole of garbage. It is literally the least punishing stealth game ever, combined with EXTREME punishment for getting hit by bosses. The game systems also encourage grinding in numerous different ways. Grinding is bad game design, period. 

If you have played any 3D stealth game in your life, the stealth gameplay will be trivial. And incredibly boring. If you alert an enemy, walk away for 30 seconds and the enemy will forget all about you. WTF?! Is this a PS1 game? Over half of this ""hard"" game would be literally trivial gameplay for a 10 year old. 

The other bits are literally rote memorization bosses that kill you in 2 to 3 hits. So you will likely die and have to traverse back to try again. It is pure tedium, which is the actual design mechanic Miyazaki has perfected; disguising tedium as gameplay. Additionally, the main strategy in this game is spam the parry button. Apparently it works on 80-90% of bosses. BORING!!! It is an insultingly easy stealth game wrapped around an insultingly punishing, but boring, action game. Who pretends to enjoy awful gameplay like this? Add in the Fromsoft classics of obvious dropped inputs and one of the worst cameras of any 3D game made past 2002 and this becomes a truly dreadful game.

TLDR: This game is trash. Miyazaki is one of the most overpraised creators in the history of the world. In 30 years, people are going to try and play these praised games and wonder just how high (or dumb) you had to be in order to pretend to enjoy this crap. 30 years before this shit-stain you had Super Mario 3, and Sid Meyer's Pirates, and Sim City. Games that are inherently enjoyable. This game inherently sucks. It also has objective technical issues like the capped 60 FPS from a 2019(!) game and the dropped inputs and Mario 64 level-of-awful camera, that you should not be able to argue about.

If you don't believe me, just Google ""Sekiro camera issues"" and see people step up to simp for Miyazaki and pretend that every game he has ever made is totally perfect.

It feels like From gutted the RPG experience in a bid to have better action than ever before, but because of how parry-focused this game is, the action actually feels like a dumbed down rhythm game. The exploration and level design is also a lot more confusing and frustrating in this game because of the verticality given to the player. In the Souls games, you pretty much could just follow every path to its end and you would be pretty unlikely to miss that much. In this game, you need to keep your eye out for random tree branches to grapple to which could appear above or below where you're standing on a cliff face hundreds of feet away, or walls to climb that sometimes aren't very clearly signposted, which can lead to you getting lost even just trying to complete the main story. 

That being said, the combat definitely still has the potential to be quite satisfying. The final boss of the standard route is one of the most exhilarating fights From has ever made, so there's definitely fun to be had.

When looking for advice, tips or technique about the game the most common responses in forums are ""i just did it"" or ""just do it without {spirit emblems, attack power, prayer beads, consumables, any skills, etc etc}"" or ""you can just do {be perfect} and win"", or ""it wasn't a problem for me"". This being the standard community response when people are asking for help when struggling shows you everything you need to know about the game.

I wish people would just say:
""It was hard, and i'm glad i did it so i can say i did.""
Which is great, i feel the same way,

It's hard all the way through, it doesn't get easier, you can't go out and try other things and come back stronger, you won't magically get better.

The lineup at the end with Owl(85 attempts), Owl2(143), and the final boss(157) are nutty hard, in remarkably un-fun ways, lightning w/e is the dumbest gimmick in the game. The game always finds a new way to do something rude. The example i roll my eyes at the hardest is the merchant you can buy ako's sugar and divine confetti going away when you get the world to the final state to fight the last 3 bosses... glad him and his buddy are gone just before the fights i'd want those the most for /s

If you're coming to this from DS/ER don't waste your time unless you're the type of player who likes to play with 10 Vigor or Soul Level 1. Sekiro makes the choice for you what weapon you'll use and how hard the game will be, you don't get any control over that, unless you want intentionally not gain attack power or prayer beads or ring a bell and make everything worse lol.

Sekiro,814380,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198054547173,"Let's start with the reason for this review being negative: I don't believe this game deserves this high of a score in Steam's community rating system. Personally, yes, I do reccomend this game, but the issues with new player expierience are too glaring for this game to be Overwhelmingly Positive. 

I won't be focusing on the positives too much here, there's plenty of other reviews about that. And they're right, mind you, the combat systems *is* that good, the world *is* that cool. 

So what are my issues with the new player expierience? Two things, mainly: consumables and penalties. Your Shinobi Prosthetics use a consumable resource that you have to farm if you run out while learning a boss. There are enemies that are extremely hard to fight without a specific item. Ran out while learning? Welp, go farm. 
Another thing - Dragonrot. That's a union between consumables and penalties. And I know Dragonrot doesn't actually matter, that you have to intentionally try to make it a real problem because there are enough items to cure it, but that doesn't change the fact that it feels awful. 
Just like the next thing - loss of exp and money on death. Like, why? I died, I don't need extra penalties to know I've failed. The only thing this system incentivizes is roaching out whenever you feel like you might die for real. And what do you do after that? Run to the bonfire. Which s the same result as death. It also hinders exploration because if you see anything that resembles a boss arena and you're currently holding a lot of exp or gold you just can't enter it. So you have to go farm enough exp or gold to buy what you want, and only then can you progress. Not cool imo. 

And so all of that amounts to game punishing you for learning. Which seems real weird considering that also seems to be the main way of playing it. It also doesn't help that you are the weakest at the start of the game, both in terms of resources and personal skill. You lack many useful upgrades, your healing is very limited, your health and attack power are low. 

A few side things: 
- stealth is quite a big part of the game, so it's a bit weird how the enemies are dumb as fucking bricks. Their vision and hearing are terrible, unless the game says ""nu uh"" on a few occasions and gives them supersight and hearing. There's one ninja that has cheats and will lock onto you the moment you enter his zone or kill the dog that alerts him. The only way to kill him with stealth is to drop from 100 meters above him. Ranged enemies have generally better eyesight, so I guess that make sense but still feels weird compared to their dull melee kin. Oh, did I mention they have ZERO information spread? If you throw a shuriken at an enemy talking to another enemy the one you hit will lock onto you, but the other one will be just midly concerned. There can be situations where an eneme is chasing you while all the other ones in the are are just going about their business. 
- the game's paths feel forced at times. The ever-useful grapple can only connect to points the developers put by hand. So sometimes there's 50 of them all around, but then suddenly when it'd be really useful and help you skip something bam, not a single point, even if it feels like it should be there by game's logic. I don't recall the exact circumstances but I've encountered a rocky wall a child could climb but since it wasn't designed so it was impossible for my nimble shinobi to go up it. The point is that the clash between a nimble shinobi and a character that has to follow a set path oftentimes exposes the game for what it is. 
- the deatblow animations, while extremely cool, seem like a bit of an overkill for bosses' first healthbar. I put a hole in a normal guy's throat and he just shrugs it off the first time around. It's more of a nitpick but it does feel funny/weird.

Sekiro,814380,29.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198121367892,"Sekiro is a great game that suffers from the syndrome known as being apart of the Soulsborne Legacy. That is to say, everything that Sekiro does right feels like an evolution of the Darksouls formula, but fails to let go of aspects that makes it miserable. The game play is excellent- when you already know exactly what to do. The map is well designed - when you know exactly where to go. The game is fun to play - after you've already mastered it. If that sounds nice too you, get it, but I can't recommend a game like that in good faith.

Pros (which there are a lot of)
- Fast and Interesting evolution of Souls-Borne combat
- Excellent Boss-gated Leveling system
- Amazing atmosphere 
- Interesting Bosses

Cons
- Weird tacked on Souls-mechanics that detract from the Experience (Abhorrent camera, Weird hitboxes, Souls-esk Stumbling and Uncharacteristic clumsiness, occasionally inconsistent rules)
- Lack of proper tutorialization/introduction to mechanics (Lightning attacks, Shielded Enemies, Archaic actions required for certain areas of progression.)
- Very forgettable story with mediocre characters
- Beginner unfriendly, not encouraged to experiment (Very low heath at game start, Potential to be soft-locked out of using an XP mechanic due to death mechanic, Items made to ease difficulty implemented frustratingly poorly.)

I'd say this game is a time sink, where if you spend the time, you WILL enjoy it, but after 40-some hours, I know for me this is not something I'd recommend to others, nor is something I'd complete without a guide in hand, cheesing every boss I had the mispleasure of facing for the first time.",False,4,1,1761605666,N/A,Steam

There are too many good games out there to waste 30 hours on this. I would suggest Nine sols as a similar game that just was miles better for me. Sekiro has potential to be amazing if it leaned into one on one combat and reworked a couple of the areas, but it feels like it does its best to avoid this, so overall not worth the time or money.",False,7,2,1761366186,N/A,Steam

NBA 2K20 continues the franchise’s tradition of delivering a highly realistic basketball simulation, with stellar visuals, tight gameplay, and robust content. However, it’s not without its flaws.

Pros:
Gameplay Mechanics: Smooth and responsive controls make dribbling, passing, and shooting feel intuitive. AI improvements enhance realism in both offense and defense.
Graphics and Presentation: Stunning visuals and lifelike player animations capture the essence of the NBA, while dynamic commentary keeps the experience immersive.
MyCareer Mode: A compelling storyline with celebrity involvement adds depth, alongside satisfying customization options for your player.
Variety of Modes: From MyTeam to MyLeague, there’s plenty of content to keep players engaged, whether you prefer competitive online play or managing a franchise.

Cons:
Microtransactions: Heavy reliance on in-game purchases in modes like MyTeam and MyCareer detracts from the enjoyment, especially for casual players.
Repetitiveness: Despite small updates, gameplay can feel overly familiar for long-time fans.
Server Issues: Online connectivity remains inconsistent, which can be frustrating for multiplayer enthusiasts.

Verdict:
NBA 2K20 shines in gameplay and presentation but stumbles with aggressive monetization and recurring technical hiccups. It’s an excellent choice for basketball fans who can overlook its shortcomings. Rating: 7.5/10.",True,0,0,1733461975,N/A,Steam

[h3] I asked the community which NBA game on steam to play. [/h3]
[h3] 2020 and 2015 are apparently the least bad. [/h3]


[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]

I can't compare with other NBA 2k's because I haven't played since Allen Iverson's 03.
But I enjoy playing this one, the game is smooth and stable, the difficulty is easily adaptable to your level.
Progression through the game is fast, and the gameplay can be adapted according to ability.
Dribbling is much more complex than I remember, where I used to dribble all over the place with the SG.
Gameplay can be adapted to make the game very arcade-like, big dunk, stealing, fast pass, alley oops and I love it.
The MyCareer mode is very bad, we need a very low level to progress, better than Jordan but ridiculous all the same.
I probably don't understand the concept of this mode, even though it's one I'm very fond of in any other sports.
The ambiance is very immersive, though, and you really feel like an NBA player.
The other “online” modes are inactive, and the game can be considered dead if you don't play against the AI.


[h3] The game is dead, but I still enjoy the occasional match, so I can only recommend it if you don't want to play online.  [/h3]

Shovel Knight Dig,1089350,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Simulation, Sports",76561199021215044,"NBA 2K20 has received overwhelmingly negative reviews, becoming the 5th lowest-rated game on Steam.
Bugs and Technical Issues
There are numerous bugs and technical problems that hamper the gaming experience. There are tons of graphical performance issues, with some users noting that the game looks less crisp and polished compared to its console counterparts. Performance problems and lag have also been mentioned, affecting gameplay smoothness and responsiveness.
One of the most prevalent complaints is the rampant cheating in online modes. Only the PC version is plagued by hackers, significantly diminishing the enjoyment of multiplayer gameplay. The lack of effective anti-cheating measures has led to a toxic online environment, with many users exploiting the game's vulnerabilities.
2K Games has been criticized for their insufficient efforts to combat cheating. The absence of robust anti-cheat systems has allowed hackers to run rampant, particularly in online modes. This issue has persisted across multiple iterations of the game, leading to frustration among legitimate players seeking fair competition.
The combination of bugs, cheaters, and lack of anti-cheat measures has severely impacted the overall gaming experience. While some players find enjoyment in single-player modes like MyCareer and MyLeague, the online component of NBA 2K20 on PC is frustrating and unbalanced due to the prevalence of cheaters.
In conclusion, NBA 2K20 for PC has been marred by technical issues, rampant cheating, and inadequate developer response to these problems. While the game may offer some enjoyment in its offline modes, the online experience falls short of expectations due to the lack of effective anti-cheating measures and the resulting toxic environment.",False,3,2,1732724986,N/A,Steam

This game is complete trash, filled with clunky mechanics, frustrating shooting glitches, and zero innovation. It doesn’t even work half the time, making it more of a chore than a game. The MyCareer mode is painfully shallow, and the constant push for microtransactions feels exploitative. The company is extremely greedy, more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of fans than delivering a quality experience.

Honestly, I can’t imagine even basketball legends like Shaquille O'Neal would call this game anything but trash - he’d probably take a sledgehammer to a copy, smash it to pieces, and then set it aflame! And let’s be real, I wouldn’t be surprised if LeBron James took the DVD and pissed on it! All NBA players would be embarrassed to be associated with this mess.

The company keeps releasing the same game year after year, milking fans dry while delivering nothing new. No one should buy this game! I’d rather burn money, set my house aflame, or destroy all my clothes than endure this mess again. I’d happily shatter every window in my home and watch it be torn down instead of playing this game for another minute.

Letting myself be bitten by a snake sounds more appealing than facing the clunky gameplay and endless glitches. I’d rather stub my toe repeatedly, fail all my exams, or have all my life’s hard work be destroyed than deal with this disaster. I’d even willingly get my leg amputated or spend a week in a jail cell rather than suffer through NBA 2K20. Honestly, I’d rather be eaten by lions than put up with this game!

I’d gladly take a sledgehammer to my TV, dig a hole in my backyard, or scrub my floors with a toothbrush just to escape this non-functional mess. Cleaning out a filthy garage, organizing my sock drawer, or listening to elevator music for hours sounds like a welcome distraction. The thought of watching paint dry or listening to a lecture on tax law feels like a treat compared to this. I’d rather clean my gutters, deal with a flat tire, or spend an entire weekend cleaning the attic than endure NBA 2K20.

The short version.
nba 2k = linear if you want excitement better tape sparklers to your fingers!
what we need is nba jam 2: Mantle Breakdown!!!! !!!!
you know, if you like b-ball and want to support the players then youd prob be better not buying this, most these games the players dont get a dime for this anyway! or 90% off!

End.

so these game arnt the most playable of b-ball games, as far as i can see the only reason these games exist is for fans to buy one with the likeness of the players they love but considering they dont really get any cash or support from that, instead some fat, rich, son of as bitch is that lil bit rounder. why bother?? the game play aint special.
I mean if you want a game that really secures the excitement of the sacred smouldering rock the ONLY CONTENDER IS NBA JAM the original the best the 1 true flamming rock of freedom and dunk truth!!

same with football  though footballers in uk do get insane money for playing, no 1 buys a football game cause its so playable ahah nope, its because people worship the ground that these players walk on, yet the most fun football game for me was made in the 90s and goes by Cannon fodder Vs sensible soccer (Amiga)

I think the main diff in playablity is back in the day most games where made by thinking of specific joy associated with an experience and then the translation of that feeling to an experience of play that creates the same elation in a couch analog XP but in a fun way!

Thing is they didnt have flashy graphics or lure of prosthetic stash greed grabs or any of the other anolog anologs that replace mechanics of joy! the game was built around the feeling they engineered as a mechanic. wich to me is worth more than this

basically if you took the sides off a chess board, the urgency for involvement looses its need, movement seems pointless after awhile & eventually all the pieces would just go home, why havent we?

The thought behind the feeling of the old classics is what creates happy couch bouncing mania, question.. if u nudge yr friends pad will he laugh and carry on? meanwhile with this 1 after time there is a resounding pitch in my head resonating like background static feedback through speakers that my mind has chosen, not so subtly to accompany with cricket leg rubbing! it compels me to turn the game Off!

I knew this walking in however looking at this from a casual player perspective they will almost NEVER go past ascension 10 so if they do that on all 4 characters that's still 1 hundred maybe 2 hundred hours just to experience half the game. and once you hit higher ascensions you are forced to choosing 1 of like 3 decks on every character if you want to win consistently.

It's easy to pick up and engaging, but the more you master it and become familiar with it, the more you realize how much it relies on RNG. Everything is chance to the point of every loss feeling less like a strategic error and more like you did not get lucky enough on the cards drawn.

Compare this to Balatro. Balatro is perfectly balanced, and once you gain skill in Balatro, beating the base difficulties feels pretty easy. You unlock new decks and new chips which enhance the difficulty, and it can become as difficult as you want. 

In Slay the Spire, you have no choice. It'd be like Balatro starting you off with one of the highest difficulties and saying good luck. This is lazy game design; add gradations in difficulty and let people have satisfying runs where they feel OP before it ends and they unlock a higher difficulty. You're literally climbing the same levels each time in this and it feels like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill only for it to fall back down over and over again. Not satisfying at all, losses feel unfair and painful versus informative, not enough unlocks to incentivize repeated plays, and the art is so basic. Balatro's art is interesting and each Joker is unique, but in Slay the Spire the enemies are way too bland for a game for game in the fantasy genre. You fight literal slime, furry creatures, and basic hooded robbers. Many times you spawn with a shop a level ahead of you that you can't afford to purchase from, simply because of RNG. With lazy game design, art design, and unsatisfying replayability, I'm surprised the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Just because a game can hook you for a few hours doesn't mean it's fun or worth your time and money.

Slay the Spire,646570,24.99,0,solo,"Indie, Strategy",76561198146544407,"Alright, I'm writing a review for this game because I enjoyed the card game IRL.

This version of the game is *not* soemthing I encourage people to play under the genre of roguelike deckbuilders. In its current state, it is near-unplayable.

The game requires you to be a statistics focused person, or basically a card-game deckbuilder pre-planner. Why am I using all these nonsensical words? It is because of how much RNG there is to play this game.

All the enemies are generated randomly. Okay, no biggie, you expect that in a card battler.
All the rewards are generated randomly(including things like gold). Okay, no biggie, this is rogue-like.
All the bosses are generated randomly. Okay...no biggie, this is still rogue-like.
All of the rewards at a merchant are generated randomly. Okay...it's still rogue-like...righT?
Your starting buffs at the game are generated randomly. Isn't that the point of rogue-like?
Your character's card deck is created randomly. Zachary_XYZ_Fusion, what is your point!? Isn't the point of Roguelike games to have replayability by randomizing certain variables?
Yes, yes, I'm getting somewhere.
You're iimited to 3 energy per turn, which means on average you can only play three cards in your hand. 
Your hand is randomized, of course, unless you have deck control, which is of course random rewards(not every character gets this).
You're card-locked via ascensions, which means you must progress, complete a boss, then fail to gain ""exp"" to unlock other cards for better runs.
You're also unable to increase your starting rewards unless a previous run beats a boss, so abandoning runs for a better run is punished in a rogue-like game. You know, where if you're starting aspects are shit, you just reroll right? No, you can't reroll. It is fixed rewards according to teh bosses you beat, with all this combination in between randomized.
You're also still dealing with devastating debuffs the enemy can inflict on you. In a game with flat numbers, as you see in their combat right, you think, okay weaken takes all my damage by 1 like the card game? No, it's by percentage. so 25% damage increase, 50% damage increase, and so on. That's ontop of the RNG.

Of course, it is. The point I'm making is that you are hardcoded to fail most runs. Everything you do is randomized ASIE from your starting relic(which is basically just character ability). Every single character has enemies that hard-counter their decks, regardless of their structures, especially if they outnumber you. In addition, you cannot play this game without playing that characters meta.

I have so far been unable to enjoy an ironclad strength build because every enemy I fight deals 7-12 damage an attack(usual max HP is 70 on him), and I have to spend it to block and still have to deal with my HP dropping. To be clear, after each section you clear, your HP DOES NOT regenerate unless you have a relic that allows you too, and you can only REST at ONE location(very spare rest sites on the map).

In addition, it says I have ten hours right? Or something like that? That was ten hours of me just clicking buttons with nothing interesting going on. Animations DO NOT change, and all the card text and image becomes repetitive exactly after 8 hours.

It is a time waster, with an unfair amount of progression required. I could go into the math in this review but I'm already insanely frustrated with the amount of CARD-GAME PROBABILITY you are REQUIRED to understand to have fun with this game. big X


This is NOT a game I recommend to ANYONE. This is a FAIL TO PLAY game, not a PLAY TO SUCCEED game. There is such a thing as too much randomized generation of certain things. This is one of those types of games.

It seems to me that a lot has been changed, and all for the worst: the game was already difficult, now It's insane. You won't win any run, even at level 0, unless you absolutely always make the best (and only) choice at disposal: get a ""wrong"" card, and you'll be screwed; meet the wrong enemy, and you're done. I'm not even sure if most of the runs are winnable. The game is not a deck builder anymore, it has become a puzzle game for people that enjoy the grind of trying all the possible combinations for a run until you get the optimal. Usual deck builder strategies do not apply here, you just need to know EXACTLY what is the only viable choice in every situation. And I'm not exaggerating: if you just add a card that won't synergize perfectly with the cards and artifacts you'll get in the future, in the third act you'll loose because of that card. If you don't add one because you're not sure if it will synergize later, you're screwed. If you don't do enough combat encounters, you will not find the cards that are indispensable; if you don't take enough events you won't be able to remove enough cards and you will loose. Unless totally everything is perfect (and I mean everything: speaking of the ironclad, you need a lean deck, at least 4 energy, a way to weaken stronger enemies, a way to hit enemy groups, a very strong attack to kill bigger enemies, a way to obtain enormous amount of shield and of course a way to be able to use all of your tools at the right moment) you will loose even at level 0.

This is a very rare example of the opposite effect, you don't notice the amount of time spent but you end up in resentment and wishing you could get it back.

- The difficulty scaling of this game is absolutely ridiculous. I've played for over 50 hours and done dozens of runs with all characters, unlocked everything, and yet my win rate is around 20%, probably less. I've never gone above Ascension level 1, and there's 20 fucking difficulty levels. I can't even imagine what it's like at its hardest.
Are you supposed to spend the majority of your time playing the game HOPING you get the perfect combo going, and if you don't, wallow in frustration over the past hour or so that you just wasted in the attempt? It's unfair as fuck.
- It's simply far too reliant on RNG. RNG of the cards you get, RNG of the relics you get, RNG of the cards you draw, RNG of the enemies actions. RNG of the map layout and which enemies you fight. If it's not enough that runs can be ruined by just a couple of random effects, making mistakes when playing the cards feels that much more punishing. 
- The concept of Crowd Control does not exist in this game?!?! No character has any ability to freeze, stun, banish, nothing.
- I'm not kidding about the difficulty, if you don't have VERY good RNG in your run, you're not even reaching the final boss which is again, ridiculous.
- Graphics are laughably basic and downright ugly to the point where you'd think a kid could have drawn most of the art in this game. There's barely any animation anywhere.
- Coming from other/older card games like Hearthstone, the visual and sound effects of the cards themselves are really light and underwhelming. Every single application of block sounds the same, every single ""strike"" card sounds the same, across all characters..
- There's only 4 characters which is too low, and because of the very bad balance, you quickly discover the ""build variety"" is a lie since nothing but a very select few OP combos will get you the win.
- After the first 15 or so hours the progression completely stops. You learn nothing new, you unlock nothing new, you've seen all the enemies in the game, and that's when you start the downward spiral of ""I could have finished if my RNG was a little bit better"", and eventually end up realizing the truth of this hideous RNG reliance far too late, like I did.
- Losing in this game feels like shit. And you will do that a lot.
- Single-player only.
- Achievement hunting is atrocious. You're not getting half of these achievements without the blessings of Allah, Jesus and Buddha COMBINED.

Praise be the following, however:
- The music in this game is so fucking good, it's easily the most memorable and best thing about it hands down, greatly helped to push through some of the frustration.
- Unlike Hearthstone & all the other major card games out there, there is no such thing as ""running out of cards"", you simply reshuffle your discard pile and start drawing again. The idea is fantastic and allows for some matches to last far longer and do much crazier stuff in them than you would otherwise.
- The thematic feel of each of the 4 distinct characters is very well done.
- The daily climb mode lets you see combinations of different characters and get some really broken combos.
- Potato graphics means this can run on a potato PC.
- 500 MB size, lmao.
- Cheap.

I've lost too much time chasing that godtier run where everything clicks together so well, forgetting that you're supposed to be able to have fun in a roguelike even if the RNG is not that much in your favor. That you can still beat a game with a bad to average build if you have enough skill. Here, that's simply impossible.

Even within the card battler roguelike genre, I've played far, far better games that are either less frustrating in challenge by default and/or can be experienced in co-op which mitigates the RNG factor, such that if 1 player has bad deck/card draw, another player can help carry the run to some degree with their better RNG.

Very basic. I feel like once you've played it for about an hour or 2, you're not really going to run into anything new with the gameplay or progression. It seems there's only 3 levels to clear, which will take you around 90~120mins, and you just do that over and over again, while not really getting much stronger per run aside from the new cards you unlock on level up (which only happens once every 2~3 attempts, and then you have to find those cards in a run.

Slay the Spire,646570,24.99,0,solo,"Indie, Strategy",76561198054080636,"This game is fun at first, when you aren't trying to do what is essentially the new game plus versions where it gets harder after every success.

The game's major issue can be summed up pretty easily.

1. It is punishingly hard, it's probably the hardest card game that is on steam and even people with thousands of hours in this game can't beat it on even 10/20 difficulty reliably.

2. Every climb starts with the same kit, and that kit is TERRIBLE. Because the kit is terrible you are super screwed after the first half of the first floor if you didn't get lucky with the card drops.

3. There are bosses that just hard counter specific card combinations and if you didn't already know that you're just going to lose once you get to that boss.

4. The game is overwhelmingly based on RNG. What cards drop are random, how bad the monsters are is random, what kind of boon you get to start with is random, what items drop from bosses are also random.

Some of these items are great, some of them are outright trash, and some of the enemies you can run into are so stupidly strong they can take you from full hp to dead in a single encounter.

If you're fine with restarting over and over and over again and maybe having 1 in 5 runs be actually viable to even get past the first floor of the three then go ahead and play this game but as it currently stands you may as well just go sit down at a slot machine because that's basically all this game is.

The only reason I can see for so many people liking this game is the fact that I seriously doubt anyone actually tries to clear the harder modes. If you just played it for like 10 hours, beat the first mode, and quit it would probably feel like any other deck builder but the fact is that level goes from 0 to 20 and it gets punishingly hard at like 5.

To give you an idea, only about 14% of people playing this game have reached the part where you actually beat it (which is on 3 out of 20 levels) and the number of people who have beaten tier 20 is about 7% of the people playing int. Only about 16% of the players have even gotten to 10.",False,8,1,1757483443,N/A,Steam

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561199000903927,"Fantastic game. It's a one of a kind storytelling experience alongside Automata in my opinion. 

The pros:
The story is great, the world, characters and even some quests are good. The music is the best part of the game for me, the Nier series really knows how to accentuate story moments using fantastic songs and get raw emotions out of you without the need for any lyrics.

I really like how Yoko Taro changes gameplay elements in the middle of the playthrough, like now you're in a hack and slash and the next moment you're basically playing a visual novel, or the camera changes to an isometric view in some levels, cool stuff.

I love how the subsequent routes recontextualize past events in the story, this is my favorite storytelling quirk so I may be biased toward it lmao.

Now for the cons: 
I would say this is a remaster of the 2010 game with some added content, not a full remake, which means the quests, combat and upgrading weapons can be rough. I've seen a trend with older jrpgs having a lot of meaningless grinding and repetitive quests. There are a lot of fetch quests that make you go from place to place without the means of fast travel which can get annoying really fast, which is a shame since there are some side quests with great stories behind them. 

The combat is not bad but I wouldn't really call it satisfying for me, it's reminiscent of Automata but unpolished at the same time. The grind to upgrade your weapons is too much so I didn't really do that, but the weapon stories that update as you upgrade them could be worth it if you like little lore pieces.

The ways to get all endings can be hit or miss, playing the game multiple times can seem like a waste of time sometimes. Though the last ending which is original to this upgraded version of the game is really worth it in my opinion.

Also I wasn't a fan of the Kaine fanservice outfit, I don't think it's an issue for the vast majority of players but it seemed really out of place and meaningless, but to each their own.

Overall, it's a great experience, also release the Nier Replicant ver.1.22 ost on spotify already, it's been 4 years.

This game is one of those experiences that I can't really imagine leaving you after you go through it. I absolutely recommend it. The music is beautiful, the characters are memorable, the gameplay is fun, and the story is genuinely amazing, with some of the best writing and execution I've seen.
There are a few people who think the endings get a bit irritating to do over again and again for all the endings, which they aren't wrong in, but I enjoyed seeing that all again personally. With the sole exception of the Junk Heap. That place sucks. Nice music though.

This is a game you want to go into blind. Don't look up stuff before or while playing or it won't feel as impactful (this goes for most games tbh). Unless its about getting through the Junk Heap...

The updated version improves visual fidelity and gameplay flow while keeping the original structure. The world design presents a bleak tone that pushes the player to question the value of progress. Strong art direction supports this.

Combat uses light and heavy attacks mixed with magic abilities. Animation timing feels responsive. Enemy variety grows at a steady pace. Boss encounters stand out through scale and pattern recognition. The combat system is not complex but remains engaging across the runtime.

The narrative focuses on a journey to save a loved one. It presents moral ambiguity without pointing to a single correct answer. Dialogue reveals layered character motivations. Themes involve identity and the cost of survival. Emotional impact builds as the story advances.

Multiple endings encourage repetition. New routes add narrative context rather than simple alternates. Later runs change perspective and reframe earlier events. This structure rewards patient players who want deeper lore. It also increases the total playtime without feeling padded.

The soundtrack is notable. Vocal tracks rise during key story beats. Ambient music maintains tension in quieter moments. Sound design fits both exploration and combat. Audio feedback supports player awareness in fights.

Visual upgrades include refined textures and improved lighting. Character models feel more detailed. Environments show stronger depth. Performance remains stable on modern hardware. Load times are short.

Marking as Spoilers just in case.
[spoiler]
1. Complete the game to receive ending A. This took me a little over 16 hours but can be done faster if you're into that.
2. You now restart the game at the halfway point and must complete it again to receive ending B. 0 change in game play, it is literally the same game again from the half way point. You get extra cut scenes that give you a different perspective, however it is the exact same game you just played.
3. You start from the half way point again and must collect the rest of the weapons you didn't get in the other playthroughs in order to gain access to ending C and D. Again, it is the exact same game you have just played TWICE now you get a couple extra cut scenes, on top of the extra cut scenes you got after ending A. (by the way, some of these cannot be easily skipped. you need to mash your buttons to skip the dialogue, but if there is no dialogue happening on screen you need to just wait and watch a cut scene again)
4. Ending C and D occur based on a choice you make at the very end of the game. If you're wise and make a second save you can experience both without having to replay half of the game again, you do still however have to replay the ending section.
5. Choosing ending D will give you access to the new content added for this remake, but you must replay the first hour or two of the game with 0 differences before you can actually access that content. you actually get to play as a different character with an entirely new move set... but the content only lasts for about an hour or so and then its over.

I'll rate this game as a 2021 game (meaning I expect it to meet 2021 game standards), not a 2010 one.

The story is acceptable enough that it kept me playing and forced me to play and get the ABCDE endings.

And the story is the only positive thing about this game; everything else is mediocre/horrible.

- Gameplay - junky, slow. Everything you do in the game should be done faster: every dialogue, interaction, collecting anything, just everything.
- Combat - junky, tedious, repetitive. Sometimes I just ran past enemies because I didn't feel like fighting them.
- Side-Quests - absolutely horrible, boring, snooze-fest. Most of them are fetch-quests that add nothing to the game.
- Fast Travel System - should be much better, not this crap with boats where you have four places to travel and usually it's faster to get somewhere else by just running there
- Bosses - most of them were tragic, boring, and too long. Lots of gimmick bosses, multiple phases. The culmination of the bosses' tragedy was a boar that had to be killed 15 times (I counted) in many places to progress.
- The structure of this game is poor. The gameplay should be structured so that you play once and discover everything in that single playthrough, instead of everything being divided up so that in route A you get almost nothing, in route B you get a few more cutscenes, and in route C you get a few more dialogue lines.

I will start by saying the shorter version, is it good? Yes, is it worth 60 euros? absolutely not, i'm giving it a do not recommend only because there isn't a ""meh"" button on steam, but if you find this game on a heavy discount (20 euro or lower) i would say do pick it up as it's an interesting game in its own way.

Now for the long version, why thumbs down instead of thumbs up despite being meh and still recommending it when discounted? well a few factors.
First of all it's the gameplay; aside boss battles, it's like eating unsalted gluten free crackers. An infinite amount of fetch quests and ""Go here go there"" on a map that doesn't see fast travel after midgame.
Second issue is how the game hides some important mechanics or upgrades behind meaningless and voidlike subquests, i bet many people don't even know there is a mount in the game that is hidden behind a stupid sidequest at the start of the game THAT COULD BECOME AN UNCOMPLETABLE QUEST EVEN ON A ""NEW GAME+"", simply because most likely they didn't even bother doing it from how boring they are.
Third, and worst of all in my opinion, is that you don't get to see around 50% of the game until you beat it and PLAY IT AGAIN. With this i mean full on cutscenes, character stories and interactions between characters and between enemies that are simply not shown during the ENTIRE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH. When i did my first run i had literally zero attachment to ANY of the characters, and the various big reveals at the end felt like nothing due to the game literally showing NOTHING, you can play it again and get the full experience sure but now you already know how it ends and it literally spoils the whole story, missing emotions that otherwise would've been present the first run, so it doesn't matter how many times you play it, it'll still feel like total emptiness. 

I genuinely feel like i have been robbed of an amazing game if only Yoko Taru didn't have a kink with leaving things in the dark.

Despite the huge flaws though the game isn't all bad, the music is a banger, the bossfights are a banger and there are some gameplay mechanics that are unique, but those are few and far between. Graphics wise it's okay for a remaster/remake and the character models are super cool, but that's about it for the positives.

🛠️ [b]Technical Problems Galore[/b] From inconsistent frame pacing to poor mouse and keyboard support, the game feels like a barebones port.

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561197972111544,"NieR:Replicant feels like a weird stage play of a video game. The parts are there, the characters emote, there is things that make it look like a game and there is a story. But everything is just weirdly off, and not in a very interesting way. Top that with a crazy 60€ price tag for an okay port of a really old game.

The whole first act feels like an eerie hommage to Zelda, complete with the animation when the Prince receives the item, almost like a jab at the generic fantasy RPG village beginnings. The neverending back-and-forth for insanely dull main and side quests feels like some kind of subversive critique of bland gameplay. 
Characters join your party, you do one thing together and suddenly there is a huge dramatic scene where emotions overflow and the characters swear eternal allegiance to each other in the name of their unbreakable friendship. As if the script writer just tossed the whole intermittent part between beginning and end of the act out the window, which seems like some kind of parody of video game plots. The game's story beats and character reactions outside of the side quests seem so exaggerated to the point where you suspect this is leading up to some kind of plot relevant twist.
However, after hours of running back and forth on the same maps, killing the same few enemies by mashing buttons, and hearing the same generic dialogue from side NPCs I gave up trying to figure out if there is some grand point to be made and whether or not those things actually lead up to something.

There is nothing to get invested in to make me want to see it through to the end, because all you are given is the game telling you that the characters have deep connections with each other, but you never really see any of this. Side quests are aggravatingly generic in the variety of ""Kill X wolves until you get their drop Y times"", ""Bring the item to NPC Z"" or ""Deliver this item but you cannot dodge or get hit or you have to try again"". If you force yourself through these torturously laborious side quests you are rewarded with world building insights among the lines of ""Thank you!"". No interesting bits about the world or characters, no interesting philosophical conundrums like in Automata. Just a forgettable sentence of a forgettable NPC in a generic world.

There is some decent writing in there somewhere. The text wall segment in the forest was really well written and some of the dialogues are very pleasing to listen to, aided by the very strong voice acting.

But ultimately the game is so insanely flat and sterile and just feels like it's wasting your time with every bit of gameplay that stands in the way of the next bit of story that may or may not be interesting that I cannot be bothered. And I definitely don't want to slog through it multiple times for multiple endings. I'll just look up a story summary online.",False,9,1,1754347534,N/A,Steam

The voice of the book is so grating. Constant exhalation, way more than necessary. Switched to Japanese and then had trouble reading the tiny subtitles in the middle of combat. 

The constant backtracking is mind numbing. You spend more time running from A to B then doing anything. 

The side quests are the absolute worst form of MMO garbage. This is totally unacceptable. Half of them require you to either grind a bunch bullshit, or just buy arbitrary quantities of things. 

Story moments frequently lock you out of interacting with NPC's critical to services and side quests. 

Music is great but there is only like 4 songs. 

Combat sucks. No gap closer, wonky camera when locked on, getting stuck in a 5 second combo facing the wrong direction, basically all magic except dark blast is pointless and a waste of time, and every trash mob has a steel foundry worth of armor you need to bash off before doing damage. 

Characters are unlikable. Main character might be the best, fashion sense aside. The story of the endlessly sick sister that everyone wants to have her just lay in bed ""resting"" until she dies drives me up the wall. Bitches days are numbered, let her have fun. Emil is cloying and melodramatic. Kaine is some kind of futa fetish fantasy constantly talking shit.

Short Answer: Yes its worth buying, Bethesda wont stop breaking Fallout 4, and when they get around to releasing Fallout 5 in 2200, we all know it going to be horrible anyway. Dont buy over $20 wait for a sale they come around too often. 

Longer answer: Honestly screw Bethesda they need to shut their doors for good and sell the IP to someone who cares. This game is entirely made up of extremes. If somethings good, then its really good. If somethings bad, then its really bad. Iv watched this game from afar since before the release waiting for the right time if there would ever be one to buy. Its nowhere close to the miserable state of crap I expected buying it, and Im actively enjoying myself.    

If you`re thinking about buying it, its likely because Fallout 4 is just unplayable with Bethesda trying to appease their hallucinated new audience of people suddenly interested in Fallout because season 2 of the show is around the corner and they will break every mod and destroy everyone`s saves to do so.

You buy Fallout 76 because you just like wasting your money… That’s fine!
But that’s only where the fun begins!

Because guess what?
You can throw even more of your precious tinky-pinky shitey whackey cash at it!
Fallout 76 for ONLY €40.
(Base game… and by “base” I mean the bare minimum.)

Sooner or later, you’ll probably want a subscription - you know, for a bit more “comfort.”
People without taste will call it “basics"".

And to top it all off:
If you like collecting things and decorating your base a little, you can unlock a few items in-game. 
Don’t get me wrong, they look cheap or terrible at best.
The good stuff? That’s where you could get rid off of your totally worthless money.
*Takes a deep breath* ...what a lovely ingame-shop!

Wonderful, isn’t it?



If you feel scammed, don’t worry - that’s on purpose.
And whenever the game feels dull and worthless, that’s because it is dull and worthless.

Let’s go even further…

Steelrising,1151340,9.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,RPG,76561197971731514,"A lot of reviews seem to be about the poor monetization efforts of Bethesda. While I agree, I'd like to instead focus on the gameplay itself.

But how do I say this? The game just feels .... [b]empty[/b]. The map is huge and there's a lot to look at, but every location I venture in to feels incomplete. On occasion I'll come across some random world event, but in almost every location I'm finding absolutely nothing. All the enemies are dead, killed by a player that just recently passed through.

To circumvent this and experience the location in its entirety, I need to hop servers until I find one where the POI I'm exploring hasn't already been ransacked. Even then, the enemies are few and are no real threat. They die quickly, don't put up much of a fight, and have very little variety.

Fallout games are known to be packed with mini adventures in every corner. You walk into a town and there are a thousand things happening around you. You, as a player, can choose to interact with any of the things happening around you. Sometimes the things happening around you push you into a massive quest line where your decisions are paramount in the telling of your story. Sometimes the distractions simply show you pieces of lore, hint at a unique location, or give you some mini adventure to help immerse you in the world.

Fallout 76 has none of that. 

And, I know what you're thinking: ""This is an MMO, not a traditional RPG story telling game."" and I hear you. So let's focus on it from the MMO aspect and you'll still find it really has nothing to offer. Player interactions are very infrequent and there is often no incentive to work together. World events offer no challenge and don't warrant working together. And since the world scales around you, enemies will be just has difficult when you're level one then when you're level 1,001. The only difference is you'll have a different weapon to kill them with.

I have absolutely no incentive to grind and unlock gear, or to explore locations to find unique items. Everything requires an absurd amount of resources and, inevitably, you'll find you can't gather everything without paying more real money (I know I said I wouldn't talk about the monetization, but come on!)

I've seen this game be compared to Little Kitty Big City due to the main character being a cat and how you could move around as said cat, and to be honest the comparison is almost unfair given how much better this game is story-wise and cat-wise. I could go on and on about how much better this game is compared to LKBC, but if you see both games yourself you can see the obvious differences that shoots this game up the highest in cat-related games. I actually had so much fun roaming around as a little furball, this game does an amazing job at making you FEEL like a cat, a smart one at that. Not to mention, the ending didn't even upset me. I've seen what this game had to offer already since it's pretty much old at the time of me playing it, and yet I highly recommend giving it a try and playing on your own whether you've spoiled everything for yourself or not.

The first level is amazing, exploring the town, meeting robots and learning about how they function is great. You can explore with great verticality to either walk on the streets or over the rooftops. 

But unfortunately it falls off pretty hard after that, the sewers are intense and I liked the vibe but the gameplay was stale and very linear. The town in the sewers is also just a path to go further up untill we reach midtown. 

Midtown was the most disapointing aspect for me because while it is pretty big there is just so much less in it. You can't really climb up anywhere to explore and outside of the main quest you can ignore everyone in it unless you really want to see what their one line of dialoge will be.

Stray,1332010,17.99,0,solo,"Adventure, Indie",76561198120434866,"""Everybody, Everybody, Everybody, Wants to be a Cat!!!"" -The Aristocats

I want to start this off that I saw this game when it first released and was not sure on why it was getting all of this praise as a ""Stray Cat"" game. After the shelf life that this has accumulated, eventually going on a good sale, I decided to purchase it.

The game title best describes what you are, a stray cat... It starts you off with your companions, you are thus separated from them and on a whole another adventure. At first I was starting to lose steam on playing this, then experienced the puzzles that you have to solve and that drew me in more. This is very interesting to the point that they're are no words spoken through the entirety of the game. Only noises, and then translated through text, where the player has to read it, which does not sway my opinion of the game. I in fact enjoyed the humming of the machines in the dead city and the robots that you encounter with each indistinct noise that they made. Along with the beautiful atmosphere that came with it and the audio, when entering a new area was really captivating.

The character movement in the game is something like the ""Assassins Creed"" titles of climbing building with the swift jumps that a cat makes on each ledge to get to a certain point, with out the frustration of falling of the ledge and having to re-climb back up. This is, in itself is a very linear puzzle game... However, what I do NOT care for is that there are two instances so far during my play through that have been now made a consistency. To the point where I was going to wait to finish to give a thorough review for something that has so much praise for playing as a ""cat"". 

In the beginning, some of the other cats did not load right away, and was stuck on the pro-loge much longer than I needed to be, because I was searching for something that was not there (the other cats to interact with to progress in the game) until 5 minutes of running around they finally loaded in, then I could then progress... The second instance is when after you find a certain individual (I'm not trying to spoil the plot) to get out of the dead city you knock a photograph off of the wall, the cat does a reaction jump scare when it falls. And I am left falling infinitely out of the map and can see my cat at resting position, just falling..... infinitely...... (I have done it three times to see if it was a one time thing, but this is a consistency)... The game is riddled with bugs and fixes that you have to look out for in the game such as, the ""sentry's"" that are in the game, will start doing different spawn patterns and you will see it once you either restart the game or the last saved checkpoint. Some of the puzzles do not work unless you once again, restart to a last saved checkpoint. Being at a puzzle and it not registering that I did the puzzle and then coming back to it later, doing the exact same thing, then it finally works miraculously. This is such a disappointment...
 
It runs and looks good, they're is some points in the games cut scenes where I am almost disappointed, on how ""blotchy"" the cats look, this is running the game at the maximum capabilities that it has to offer, and running it normal with no issues what so ever.

Brass Tax:
In my opinion, I can tell that this is very in depth on what the developers have done, the work they put into this and I can see it, the game has a good plot and story. However the fact is, I can not see myself doing another play through of this after finishing the first one, especially with some of the bugs that has me running in circles trying to progress. With the shelf life that this game has... I would ONLY get this if it is on a dumb good sale (not full asking price of the game what so ever). I am not swaying my opinion based on playing as a ""stray cat""...",False,2,0,1759905472,N/A,Steam

While exploring as a cat does have a lot of charm to it, the ending was the most infuriating. Spoilers ahead.

You get to the top, you unseal the city, but I get to see almost nothing of what happened to my friends I made along the way. I spent so much time in the low area, was shopping with them, bartering, and all I see is one robot happy. Just feels a bit, of a shame.

My companion B-12 kills himself at the end for the greater good. Bit of a boring plot device that I kind of saw coming. Once we get back to the outside, what other purpose would he serve, all the humans are dead. Again his whole demise felt a bit, rushed. The whole final level felt rushed and just a bit, boring. It was underwhelming and sad.

I really liked my cat player and I think its a good game at half the price. But I finished it in 6h30m didn't focus on collectibles but tried to explore everywhere.

There was a lot of room with the world they had created to expand upon it with the characters and allow me to revisit or, see people rise up against the peacekeepers and the sentinels, things like that. I don't know why they felt a need to cut the game so short.

- clipped through floors at certain spots when trying to do quests
- NPCs needed for quest wouldn't move/walk/give items
- bugs only start after the rooftop/outsiders arc for me

good story, very cute protagonist, great music, very sick character designs for NPCs (ily Morusque), ok-ish graphics (very pretty atmosphere but looks weird up close IN MY OPINION), ok-ish performance/optimisation (frames would drop at certain areas, especially before chase scenes) but sooo buggy for a game that has been released for 3yr+, cost 29$(?) and won awards

Its really useful for trying expensive models in gameplay before you commit to buying them in real life. Its very fun game and has so many quality of life features that make playing 40k a lot quicker and easier but definitly shouldnt be used to substitute the real game. 
Its also very easy to make your own custom mods for the game like datacards or codexes, or any kind of text or data document you want really, you literally just need a PDF image and you can upload it to a custom template then save it, posting social media is probably harder!

(I don't remember the desktop mode being that good either though) I figured being able to interact with the pieces would be kinda neat. Nope! You load in, select Chess, and then you move your hand over a piece. Now, what I would expect to happen if this game were actually good, is the piece under your hand would highlight, and then you can pick up and place said highlighted piece. You want to know what actually happens? Nothing. You straight up can't pick up the pieces? Maybe I have to set up inputs for the controllers? Which is stupid, but I go to the menu anyway, and it was just desktop inputs. 

I then flicked through the other games just to make sure Chess isn't just bugged or something, so I try Checkers, same deal. Then I think poker? You can't interact with the cards or the chips. Literally how is this hard? Surely this would be a total slam-dunk for the dev? Pick up chips->flick analogue stick up or down to select amount of chips. Then idk, some other button to confirm splitting of the amount. Amount selected stays in hand, surplus returns to stack. Same with cards. Pick up deck-> flick analogue stick to deal to highlighted areas like players or the community cards. 

You can't do any of that though, what you can do, is hold A to move the camera... And... flick pieces, very inconsistently I might add. Sometimes it flicks them, sometimes it tries to select them as if you were holding down m1 in windows to select multiple files.

“What if tower defense… but also ranked anxiety?”

You boot it up thinking “haha monkeys vs balloons,” and suddenly you’re sweating over **optimal eco curves** while some guy named “xxBLo0nGodxx” sends fortified ZOMGs on round 28.

---

### Pros:

* Same adorable Bloons, now in glorious HD ruining your entire evening.
* Heroes add “personality” which is nice, because you definitely need Quincy saying “I never miss” after you absolutely do.
* Meta constantly shifting so you can never, ever be happy or comfortable.
* Every match feels like a job interview for “War Criminal, Bloon Division.”

---

### Cons:

* You: “I’ll try a fun off-meta strategy.”
  Matchmaking: *puts you against a guy with 4k hours and a spreadsheet open.*
* One mis-timed rush and your entire economy folds like a dollar store lawn chair.
* “Rubber to Gold” is also the name of what this game does to your free time.
* Ranked = climb 100 trophies in 2 hours, lose them all in 10 minutes, go lie down on the floor.

---

### Peak Battles 2 Experience:

* Both players quietly farming, building defenses, playing it safe.
  Then Round 18 hits and suddenly it’s **WWIII with purple and zebra bloons.**
* You send a giant, carefully calculated all-in rush.
  Opponent defends with 3 abilities and an emote.
  You sit there, broke, watching the defeat screen in 4K.
* “GG” typed with tears in your eyes and 3 FPS left.

Overall the game is less of a test of skill, and more of a knowledge check, at least until you get to the top .1% of players. Early laddering is basically looking at the opponents board and seeing what they forgot to account for and exploiting it. This works for most ranks, and can be fun if you like stomping newbies.

Limited to only 4 towers, one of which is a pretty useless ""hero"". Takes way too long to earn enough money to get any good towers. Even once you unlock them, you have to save up a ton more to unlock their final stages for some reason. Half the achievements are glitched, I do what it tells me to, and it just remains locked for no reason.

Update: After trying for another week, I've lost almost every single match for the last 3 days in the exact same way: I start out with 3 bars of connection, then suddenly it drops to 1 bar, and I go from full lives all the way down to 1 out of nowhere(despite my cable internet being a rock solid connection), and then it goes ""syncing"" as my screen freezes, and when it unfreezes, I've lost. No idea how or why or what caused it and no way to prevent it with the abilities. Just 10 minutes down the drain every time I try to play. Absolute waste of time, do not recommend until they fix their bugged out game.

And then the battles themselves, half the time I start with 3 bars connection then halfway through it drops to 1 out of nowhere for no reason(I regularly play FPS games and have stable, cable internet connection with no issues), which results in ""syncing"" interrupting my matches constantly for myself or my opponent. I've even had instances where I have full health and I send MOABs after my opponent, and suddenly it starts syncing, and then when it stops, I've lost. No explanation, no idea what happened, no way to prevent it. Wasted 10 minutes of play just for that, with no reward for my time spent and no way to prevent that? Get all the way to level 30 just to lost to something you can't even see? 
Highly ridiculous game. Very unstable and unreliable, steep curve for entry into the game, and seems to be pushing you to spend real money on virtual items, for little to no reward from gameplay itself.

This game requires you to create a third party ""NinjaKiwi Login"" account... there's no valid reason for this in a PC game when SteamWorks is available.  This is often done to harvest private data and profile you, with potential sale and transmission of your private data to third parties.  The developers will probably argue that you can trust them, but if they were trustworthy they wouldn't demand you create a third party account.

This represents a considerable risk to gamers due to the privacy and security implications of developers that wish to bypass Steam and harvest user data.  Remember, sometimes if the product is free, YOU are the product.[/quote]

[quote][b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction]Warning: Microtransaction infested mobile app![/url][/b]

This game is infested with a toxic mobile app style cash shop.  You will be prompted to and expected to give money to the developers through this cash shop to buy in-game goods so you can play the game.[/quote]

""Bloons TD Battles 2"" is one of thousands of nasty mobile apps infesting the ""free"" section of Steam, but it's not really free.

This inexplicably popular mobile app has the thin skin of a ""PvP Tower Defense"" game where you send enemies at the opponent while killing the ones he sends at you, but there's the rub... your towers and upgrades are locked behind ridiculous paywalls, so, like all of these scams, the victor is determined solely by who gave the most money to the mobile devs running it.

There's only a superficial game here.   The game visuals and the game itself are incredibly shallow... think of them as the too-bright, colourful, thin plastic cabinet dress theme on a poker machine at the casino. That's basically what this is.  So really, the mobile app ""game"" is just a veneer, a thin skin wrapped around a nasty, predatory mobile app cash shop.

Putting that toxic mobile app monetisation aside... this is a mobile app.  I didn't spend thousands on a gaming PC so I could pretend it's an iPhone, and I don't think you did either... this kind of mobile app has no place in your Steam library.

As with all mobile scams, you're forced to sign a highly questionable yet legally unenforceable End User License Agreement... for such a relatively low effort, low quality mobile app, this is specifically designed to invalidate your consumer rights and destroy your right to privacy.  This agreement includes questionable requirements that may attempt to revoke consumer law protections that gamers expect to have, which is also highly problematic.  Developers must learn they are here to serve gamers, not control them.  I had my cat walk over the keyboard while the EULA was displaying, which fixed that problem for me.

On the important matter of pricing and value for gamers, there's a lot going on here with monetisation, so this really shouldn't be considered a truly free product because of that.

The developer has their hand out for a $4 USD ""donation"" for this as you're expected to give them money for soundtrack DLC (that's already in the game) from Steam to ""support"" the ""developer""... digital panhandling.  Like the homeless guys who splash dirty water on your windscreen at the traffic lights.  No thanks.  That's on top of already outright scamming gamers with a paid ""club membership"" and of course, the disgusting mobile app cash shop they baked into every aspect of gameplay. 

Bearing in mind that free games don't add +1 to your game collector count, should you bother adding this to your library and downloading it?

Nope.  This isn't worth downloading.  I didn't pay money, but I still feel ripped off.

The core gameplay is really good, and fixes many of the problems I have with BTD6, and also feels much more tightly balanced. I really want to like this game, but unfortunately it does have a major problem that makes it very hard for me to do so.

This problem is the leagues system. It feels... amateur at best. How it works is that there are about 10 or so leagues, each one harder than the previous. You face players within your league and gain trophies from winning. At the end of the week the players with the highest trophy count in the league move on to the next, and those with the lowest are demoted. You can also skip a league if you get a 10 game winstreak, so if you're doing well you can quickly get to higher arenas as a newer player. I utilized this feature, and in 3 weeks I got to ZOMG superdome (the second highest arena) with a winrate of about 83%. I got second in my league and had about a 66% winrate in ZOMG superdome. During this time I was getting a lot of Monkey Money because of my high winrate so I saved up for another hero. Then at the end of that week I was promoted to Hall of Masters, the final arena.

In this arena I have about a 25% winrate. The players here are significantly better than me, and I am fighting an uphill battle because I do not have all the heroes (I have 7) and I also only have about half the towers, and only 3 of those with tier 5's unlocked. With my abysmal winrate I take significantly longer to gain monkey money to get these tier 5's and heroes to even stand on equal footing. As a result, I am in a state where I with my current skill level and upgrades am struggling massively in the highest arena, but the arena just below it I am far above the average player. There is no where for me to face players at my skill level. I either am facing players in ZOMG superdome where I feel like I am far better than the opponents and don't feel adequately challenged, or I'm facing players in HoM where I am outskilled and outleveled.

The league system needs a rehaul, as it is far too easy to get into the second highest arena (If you play consistently you can make it to the 2nd highest arena with a 26% winrate) so the skill level is far too low, but the skill level in HoM is far too high. These problems together lead to an unfun experience where I do not feel like I can face anyone at my skill level, and that is why I can not recommend this game. If this system is changed I will come back and update this review, as this is the only major issue I have experienced.",False,17,1,1753863056,N/A,Steam

The game has stunning artwork — like a living comic book. The story surprises you with its variability: you're not just playing through a plot, you're shaping it with your choices. Gradually, you start to understand the world around you and the people beside you, and you realize that in a zombie apocalypse you might have to rely on people just like them — unfamiliar, complicated, but real.
At first, it seems like the story will simply unfold on its own. But once you start thinking deeper, you understand: every decision you make could cost someone their life. The stakes rise fast.
The game offers interesting and sometimes unexpected ways to solve problems. It shows the world through the eyes of survivors — not heroic soldiers mowing down hordes of zombies, but ordinary people trapped in a world with no future. People who struggle not only with monsters, but also with simple, everyday challenges we never even think about in real life.
This is a story about how people behave at the edge of the world — without gloss, filters, or embellishment. It’s about friendship, betrayal, and difficult choices you can’t avoid. And it reminds you how important it is to have something to fight for, something to get up for every morning, something that keeps you from giving up.
It’s even a bit funny that by the end the main characters run out of ammo — a small detail, but perfectly fitting for a story that’s so genuine and grounded.
This is a story about ordinary people, just like us. People who doubt, who make mistakes, who choose — sometimes painfully, sometimes blindly. There are no right decisions here; there is only your path. A path that makes the game so powerful and touching. Because you never know what’s waiting for you around the next corner.

В игре потрясающая рисовка — будто оживший комикс. История удивляет своей вариативностью: ты не просто проходишь сюжет, а создаёшь его своими решениями. Постепенно начинаешь узнавать мир вокруг и людей рядом с тобой, и вдруг понимаешь, что однажды в зомби-апокалипсисе тебе, возможно, придётся рассчитывать именно на таких людей — незнакомых, сложных, но настоящих.
Сначала кажется, что это будет просто история, которая будет идти сама по себе. Но стоит чуть глубже задуматься — и осознаёшь: каждое решение может стоить кому-то жизни. Ставки резко возрастают.
Игра предлагает интересные и порой неожиданные варианты решения проблем. Она показывает мир глазами выживших — не героев-солдат, которые размахивают оружием и крошат орды зомби, а обычных людей, оказавшихся в мире без будущего. Людей, которые сталкиваются не только с монстрами, но и с бытовыми, человеческими трудностями, о которых в обычной жизни мы даже не задумываемся.
Это история о том, как ведут себя люди на грани конца света — без прикрас и розовых фильтров. Она показывает дружбу, предательство, тяжёлые решения, от которых невозможно уклониться. И напоминает, как важно иметь что-то ради чего вставать по утрам, не опускать руки и двигаться вперёд.
Забавно, что к финалу у главных героев заканчиваются патроны — мелочь, но очень в духе всей истории: честной, приземлённой, настоящей.
Это история о простых людях, таких как мы. О тех, кто сомневается, ошибается, делает выбор — иногда трудный, иногда неоправданный. Здесь нет правильных решений, есть только твой путь. Путь, который и делает игру такой сильной и трогательной. Ведь никогда не знаешь, что ждёт тебя за следующим поворотом.

The Walking Dead,207610,14.99,17,solo,Adventure,76561198033723713,"1/10 – A Covert Tool for Imperialist and Racist Brainwashing
The Walking Dead by Telltale may present itself as an emotional narrative about survival, but beneath its surface lies a cesspool of harmful ideologies that promote racism, xenophobia, and American imperialism. The game’s world is structured around a dog-eat-dog mentality that reinforces capitalist individualism, subtly condemning collective aid—such as free healthcare—as naive or impossible in a ""real"" crisis. This messaging aligns with far-right rhetoric that paints social welfare as weakness, conditioning players to accept a ruthless, every-man-for-himself worldview. Additionally, the game’s treatment of non-white characters often falls into tired stereotypes, with people of color either sidelined, tokenized, or forced into sacrificial roles, reinforcing systemic prejudices under the guise of ""realism.""

Beyond its regressive social politics, The Walking Dead smuggles in pro-establishment propaganda, conditioning players to distrust dissent and alternative narratives. The game’s emphasis on ""hard choices"" often frames skepticism toward authority as dangerous, mirroring tactics used to discredit whistleblowers and independent journalists—particularly those exposing crimes like the Epstein trafficking network or questioning the official 9/11 narrative. By presenting a world where questioning leadership leads to chaos, the game implicitly endorses blind obedience to power structures, silencing critical thought under the pretense of ""survival."" Even worse, its portrayal of armed militias as necessary evils normalizes the kind of paramilitary violence used to enforce imperialist agendas abroad and suppress dissent at home.

Perhaps most insidiously, The Walking Dead functions as Zionist propaganda, reinforcing the idea that security justifies any brutality. The game’s constant theme of ""us vs. them""—whether against walkers or other survivors—parallels the dehumanization used to justify apartheid and occupation. The narrative’s insistence that morality must be compromised for survival aligns perfectly with the rhetoric of militaristic regimes, conditioning players to accept oppression as inevitable. By glorifying a world where ethics are discarded for power, Telltale’s The Walking Dead doesn’t just entertain—it indoctrinates, pushing players toward a worldview where empire, racism, and suppression of truth are necessary evils. A vile piece of media disguised as a heartfelt story.

The Walking Dead,207610,14.99,17,solo,Adventure,76561197985000150,"Quite possibly the most padded game in history that doesn't feature grinding. 

There's a whole bunch of pointless dialogue that you can't skip. No matter whether you've figured out a scenario for yourself, you still have to have the game tell you what's going on as if you're an idiot. While you can examine a lot of things in each gameplay area, the majority of it is utterly useless and yet often the game won't let you progress until you've examined everything - To be told it's of no help in your current predicament. 

While the ""choices-matter"" tag is somewhat appropriate, the choices don't usually include what one would think is the most sensible route of action: A lot of the time you're expected to choose the lesser of 3 stupid solutions. 
To make matters worse the MC is a clumsy fool. You'll find yourself 3 episodes in having seen and been through the same things he has and yet he still shouts at every opportunity, doesn't look where he's going, loiters when he should be running and gives free-passes to untrustworthy people.**

The quick-time events that make up the majority of the gameplay require you to be ready to hit/mash a button at any given moment because you're often given precious little time to react when one pops up during the excessively long exposition pieces. I wouldn't mind if there was an audio prompt shortly before the game wanted an input, as that would allow you to go off and do something useful while the non-interactive parts drone-on. But the way that it is requires you to sit ready at every point for when the game surprises you with something interactive to do. 

TWD is essentially a bunch of cut-scenes that may or may not have a quick-time event in the middle and some ""wander around clicking examine on things"" sections. That's all there is to it. If you play games to solely be told a story then you'll probably like TWD: It has one and allegedly some people care about it. 
If you're looking for something you can actually participate in then forget it: It's got less gameplay than the average JRPG and only slightly more than a Visual Novel. 

**Example (spoiler warning):
[spoiler]One such example in Episode 4 is when a guy gets cornered with a little a girl and chooses to run and save himself rather than doing anything to protect the girl too. There is zero reference to this event later on when you're asked to make a choice about that guys fate. Instead the game makes out something else he did was the main influence for your decision, even if the choice you made was because of his abandonment tendencies.
I seem to recall there was a similar instance to this in an earlier episode too where the game apparently forgot about something that happened when chastising you for making a tough decision.[/spoiler]",False,1,1,1751773347,N/A,Steam

Telltale Games shifts perspective in a daring move; you now play as Clementine, no longer the protected but the protector, and that single change reframes everything. What was once a story of guidance becomes one of survival, loneliness and premature adulthood.

The emotional tone is bleaker, the choices harsher. There’s no Lee to steady your hand this time, no moral anchor. Instead, you’re forced to navigate shifting alliances and impossible decisions while the world collapses around you. Telltale doubles down on moral ambiguity, asking questions that rarely have clean answers: how much of your humanity can you sacrifice and still call yourself human?

Technically, the creaky engine and QTE remain, but they fade into the background thanks to powerful writing and performances. Melissa Hutchison’s portrayal of Clementine is remarkable: restrained, vulnerable and quietly fierce. The supporting cast, while inconsistent, delivers some of the series’ most haunting moments, particularly in its later episodes.

Visually, the comic book aesthetic continues to serve the material well, and the score - subdued yet piercing - underscores the emotional exhaustion that defines the journey.

Season Two doesn’t quite match the original’s freshness or emotional gut punch, but it’s every bit as courageous. It’s a story about growing up too fast in a world that’s forgotten kindness, where survival often feels like defeat. By the time the credits roll, you realize Telltale hasn’t just made you play Clementine... they’ve made you become her!",True,1,0,1762972619,N/A,Steam

Being released around a year after the first season, this game picks up the story months after the events of the first game. The game follows Clementine, now having to survive mostly alone, but ends up being taken in by a new group of survivors. Season two is known to have a large amount of content that was either cut or changed during development. This caused some parts of the story to come off a bit underdeveloped in some areas.

[h3][The Positives][/h3]
-Great voice acting.
-Great atmosphere.
-Good soundtrack.
-Good graphics and art style.
-The [spoiler]Kenny[/spoiler] ending is really great.
-Michael Madsen playing one of the villains is pretty cool.

[h3][Mixed][/h3]
-The story feels like a mixed bag. Some of it is good, and other parts don't feel fully thought out. It suffers from a lot of cut/changed content during development. The Russian gang being one example of this.
-The game is more dark and depressing than the first season, but almost a bit too much at times. In the first episode alone: [spoiler]Omid gets killed, Christa's baby dies, she gets jumped by bandits and possibly dies, Clementine befriends a dog which then viciously bites her, she then fights off the dog causing it to be impaled on a spike, she then has to choose to put it down or not, she's then found by a group who think she's bitten by a walker, the doctor in their group somehow can't tell a dog bite from a human bite (seriously?), she's then locked in a shed where she has to do her own stitches in a pretty graphic scene.[/spoiler] All of this stuff would be fine if it was more spaced out, but all of these things happening right after each other feels pretty forced and over the top. This whole game feels like it's lacking in some of the more cozy moments in Season 1, as bleak as that game was, it still had moments of stability and comfort.

[h3][The Negatives][/h3]
-Like Season 1, choices don't affect the core story, only affecting smaller details.
-Some characters are hard to connect with and feel like they were underutilized in the story. Many of the characters are so stupid/useless that Clementine, a literal 11 year old girl, carries the group at times.
-The plot twist that [spoiler]Kenny didn't die in season 1[/spoiler] felt like questionable fan service and undermines some of his prior character development.
-[spoiler]Christa and Omid[/spoiler] being killed/written off so early was disappointing.
-The 400 Days tie-in is massively underwhelming.
-The final decision between [spoiler]Kenny or Jane[/spoiler] feels poorly executed. [spoiler]Whether you support Kenny or not, Jane has to make up a fake scenario and put AJ at risk in order to purposely provoke Kenny and expose him as 'the bad guy'. Even though Kenny has major issues, he's justified in being angry when Jane lies to him about AJ being dead. There really isn't much reason to side with Jane unless you really hate Kenny. This choice would've been much harder to decide if it was based on an actual real scenario where Jane wasn't just being manipulative.[/spoiler]

[h3][Conclusion][/h3]
The Walking Dead: Season Two, while decent, is an ultimately disappointing sequel. It lacks a lot of the charm and writing that made the original game so beloved. I really want to like this one, but it's issues hold back what could've been a much better game. Only recommended if you really want to see where the story goes after Season 1.

In the first episode of The Walking Dead: Season Two, Clementine meets seven new characters; the leader is Carlos, a doctor with a very sheltered daughter, Sarah. There's the gruff but cool Pete, and his hot-headed nephew Nick. Alvin, a calm and level-headed guy, and his pregnant wife Rebecca. And there's Luke, who is the friendliest and has a nice accent.

By the end of the game, all seven of these characters are dead.

The entire chuffing point of The Walking Dead is that 'your actions affect the story', but at a certain point you realise that this simply is not true. See, if there is the chance of a character dying, this means the writers have to account for that character not being present, which prevents them from having any effect on the overarching storyline. For this reason, if there is ever the opportunity for a character to die, then even if you save them, they will inevitably die with little fanfare shortly afterwards, probably after only having a few more lines. And without that narrative interaction, the game is just... dull. The story isn't fun, or gripping, or entertaining in the slightest. You're trained not to have any attachment to any of these two-dimensional characters, whose deaths you gradually begin to shrug off. And most importantly, you have no impact whatsoever on the story. ""This story is tailored to your choices and how you play"" - this is an outright lie. You can be mean to a guy, in which case he shoots you, or you can be nice to him, in which case he shoots you, but he hesitates for a second and has a sad look on his face. That's literally the extent to which your decisions impact the story.

None of this is fair to blame on the writers now that we know that Telltale Games were overworking themselves and the project was held together with chewing gum and whispered prayers, but it still sucks. An utterly meaningless and miserable experience, devoid of any themes or deeper meaning, and worthy of no further examination. To its credit, the game has five different endings, because by the time it ends, the writers didn't need to worry about the repercussions... and then at the beginning of Season Three, all five of those endings are railroaded into the exact same outcome once again, with your companions dead and Clementine alone. Fantastic.

Firstly, the HUD has been remade since the previous and now uses wheels instead of scrolling and the NUM pad. The dialogue box change was nice, but it is clear the selection buttons were designed with console in mind as it works great for joysticks. But for us PC players it can be more annoying than using the scroll wheel as we did in the previous game. 

Secondly, the story is very meh. Very little of what you do actually matters. Which is a problem for the entire Telltale series, but in this season it is by-far the worst. You will save characters only for them to die 20 minutes later, sometimes in the exact same episode. Several character development attempts go absolutely nowhere and characters are forgotten by other characters shortly after their dramatic death scenes. Characters also feel rushed, with them changing their personality frequently.

Clementine is an awesome character but making her the protagonist at only 11 years old really limited what the player could do compared to Lee in the previous game. There was very little of the dramatic choices or action scenes seen in the first season.

This season also fails to take into consideration a lot of what happened in the previous season. Despite the option to use save data from the previous season, this is only used in a few dialogue options in the first episode this season. The game assumes that your version of Lee went down the path of being a saint, with disregard if the player made hostile or bad choices throughout their time playing season 1.

The Wolf Among Us,261030,14.99,17,solo,Adventure,76561198013866056,"This season shows the problems of mixing short episodes that have to quickly change locations while telling a story with a genre where writers often feel like you have to kill people all the time. You will be thinking, ""that was interesting how will this character grow from this, will they start causing problems for the group, are they going to grow and learn, never mind move the story along they're dead.""

Throughout the first season you always had Lee and Clementine and could see how they grew as characters and how their relationship changed over time. In this you frequently have characters not around in certain episodes, join late, or leave. Characters are said to possess certain traits that you don't really see, and get killed off instead of finishing any kind of story arc. In the first game you had Lee's relationship with Clementine, Lee trying to earn the groups trust, Clementine trying to find her parents, Ben feeling guilty over his actions leading to the death of people, Kenny forgiving Ben. Important characters from the first season are quickly removed from the game and even after years of zombies being around the characters you are with and more incompetent than ever. Characters from the 400 Days DLC are only given a short possible cameo with the exception of one. Choices still don't really mean anything, now amounting to little more than keeping an uninteresting character alive a little longer only to have them almost immediately killed off in a scene or killed off screen. 

The focus tries to be Clementine and what living in a world like this could turn her into, even having the cliche badly written moment of random villain you hardly know saying that you are just like him, even though you might not have ever done anything for that to even make sense. You also never end up needing to make any kind of difficult decisions that you could see causing Clementine to turn into a more harsh or violent person, making the central focus of the story often non existent. The final chapter is terrible, starting like an old serial film that seems to ignore the last chapters ending where pretty much everyone should have been dead, characters start to ignore or barely be effected by being shot, and choosing one of the two endings, pairs you with an extremely abusive person, and undoes a character arc of the previous season and ends up leading to a pretty ridiculous fairy tale seeming situation which would seem to be telling people that hanging out with violent controlling abusive people is good actually (which will be undone in as ridiculous a fashion as any other ending you get in the next season opening anyway). Zombies are also supposed to be slowed down by the cold but seem to function very well after being trapped under the ice of a frozen lake. It ends up being a much more uninteresting generic zombie story full of bad cliches than the first season with some horrible and somewhat offensive use of certain characters.",False,2,0,1675389890,N/A,Steam

Thymesia,1245430,19.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198367471798,"Golden Light is a surreal descent into madness, a grotesque first-person roguelite that fuses psychological horror, dark humor, and unpredictable systems into something that defies easy categorization. Developed and published by Mr. Pink, the game begins with a deceptively simple premise — your beloved has been swallowed by a living, breathing labyrinth known as the Gut, and you must venture inside to find her. What unfolds from there is less a straightforward rescue mission and more a journey into the subconscious, filled with meat, metal, and memory. The Gut is not just a setting but a sentient organism that shifts and reshapes itself constantly, challenging both your instincts and your sanity. Every corridor pulses with organic dread, every object might turn on you, and every victory feels temporary, as the world mutates around you in ways that blur the line between survival and absurdity.

The first thing that hits you about Golden Light is its unsettling atmosphere. Its visual design rejects polish in favor of a nightmarish rawness — textures ooze, colors clash violently, and the world feels like a fever dream painted in rust, blood, and bile. Objects that should be harmless—a chair, a telephone, a table—transform into enemies without warning, forcing you to second-guess every step. The art direction draws heavily from surrealist horror and glitch aesthetics, creating an experience that feels both handmade and otherworldly. The soundtrack enhances this chaos with distorted ambient noise, jazzy interludes, and moments of silence that feel loaded with threat. It’s a dissonant mix that shouldn’t work, yet somehow does, amplifying the sense that you’re inside a space that shouldn’t exist. The sound design is equally effective; creaks, whispers, and grotesque squelches echo through the halls, giving the impression that the environment itself is alive and aware of your presence.

At its core, Golden Light plays like a fusion of survival horror and roguelite design, filtered through an anarchic creative lens. Each dive into the Gut is procedurally generated, offering new room layouts, weapon placements, and hazards. You scavenge for keys, food, and weapons while contending with limited resources and enemies that can disguise themselves as the environment. Combat is scrappy and improvisational—guns are rare, melee weapons degrade, and sometimes your only option is to throw whatever you’re holding and hope it sticks. Even the healing items are unreliable; some will save you, others will poison you, and it’s impossible to tell which is which until you take the risk. This constant uncertainty keeps tension high, turning every discovery into a gamble. The Gut also responds to your behavior: aggression makes it angrier, while stealth and restraint might make your descent slightly easier. It’s a world that watches, adapts, and punishes overconfidence.

The mechanics are deliberately strange, mirroring the game’s surreal tone. You can feed items to the Gut to gain favor, speak to bizarre NPCs who offer cryptic advice, and even engage with talking objects that blur the line between comic relief and existential dread. The game never pauses to explain itself, trusting the player to learn through trial and error. This design philosophy can be polarizing — for some, the lack of clear rules and consistent feedback is exhilarating, a rejection of formula that makes every run feel genuinely unpredictable. For others, it can be disorienting or even frustrating, as success often depends on intuition rather than logic. Yet that very unpredictability is what gives Golden Light its identity. It’s a horror game where the biggest threat isn’t just the monsters or the darkness, but the constant erosion of your trust in what the world presents as safe.

While the roguelite structure ensures replayability, it also means that the experience can feel uneven. Some runs will gift you powerful weapons and easy layouts; others will punish you relentlessly with bad luck and overwhelming odds. The procedural generation sometimes leads to awkward pacing or environments that feel less cohesive than hand-designed levels. Combat, too, is functional rather than refined — hits lack weight, and the roughness of movement can make encounters clumsy. But these imperfections feel almost deliberate, part of the game’s chaotic rhythm. You are not meant to feel empowered; you are meant to feel disoriented, vulnerable, and occasionally absurd. When you die—and you will die often—the Gut swallows you whole, mocking you before spitting you back into the nightmare for another attempt.

What elevates Golden Light beyond its mechanics is its tone. Beneath the grotesque imagery and bizarre humor lies a surprisingly emotional undercurrent about love, loss, and obsession. The Gut can be interpreted as a metaphor for grief or guilt, devouring the protagonist’s world piece by piece. The writing swings wildly between cryptic poetry and absurd comedy, creating a tonal contrast that mirrors the instability of the world itself. One moment, the game offers a heartbreaking whisper about memory and longing; the next, it throws a ridiculous talking meat cube at you. This constant shift between sincerity and nonsense gives the story a haunting texture, as though the humor is a defense mechanism against despair.

Golden Light isn’t for everyone. Its rough edges, nonlinear storytelling, and unapologetically weird design will alienate players looking for traditional horror or slick action. But for those willing to embrace its chaos, it offers one of the most distinctive experiences in the indie horror space. It’s part roguelite shooter, part psychological experiment, and part art installation, bound together by a commitment to make the player feel something—whether that’s fear, confusion, laughter, or unease. Every moment in the Gut feels precarious, alive, and deeply personal, as if the game itself is studying how you respond to discomfort. It’s messy, raw, and often grotesque, but beneath the noise lies a strange kind of beauty—a reminder that horror can be just as emotional as it is terrifying. Golden Light isn’t simply played; it’s endured, survived, and remembered long after the screen fades to black.

Все, включая моего начальника, знали, что я несовершеннолетняя, но меня все равно постоянно предлагали мне выпить.

Я показывала ему, как проехать к моему дому, повернуть налево здесь, прямо на светофоре и т. д., но он начал игнорировать меня и повернул направо, когда я сказала налево, затем налево, когда я сказала прямо, и я ПРИШЛА В УЖАС.

К счастью, в то время я носила с собой нож. Он настаивал, что везет меня в какое-то хорошее место. Я вытащила нож, приставила его к его горлу и держала так, пока он не остановил машину. Я вылезла и ПОМЧАЛАСЬ домой.

Сразу после этого я уволилась.

Поправка: да, я девушка, но это могло случиться с кем угодно. Оглядываясь назад, чувак и до этого казался неприятным типом, но я была супер доверчивой/наивной и, вдобавок к этому, еще и пьяной.

___________________________________________________________________________________

I had just turned 19 when I got a second job as a bartender at a dive bar. Everyone, including my boss, knew I was underage, but they still constantly offered me drinks. One night, a coworker offered to drive me home, and being too young and drunk to know better, I agreed. I was giving him directions to my house—turn left here, go straight at the light, etc.—but he started ignoring me and turned right when I said left, then left when I said straight, and I was TERRIFIED.

Fortunately, I used to carry a knife with me at the time. He insisted he was taking me to a ""nice place."" I pulled out the knife, held it to his throat, and kept it there until he stopped the car. I got out and RAN home.

I quit immediately after that.

Edit: Yes, I'm a girl, but this could happen to anyone. Looking back, the guy had seemed creepy before, but I was super trusting/naive and, on top of that, drunk.

Years later, when Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" came out and Kurt Russell's character turned left instead of right, I immediately remembered that incident. I don't carry anything like that with me anymore, but I always make sure to hold my keys between my knuckles if I feel threatened—just in case.",True,2,2,1758378156,N/A,Steam

The game hooks you with its absurd atmosphere: fleshy hallways, living objects, bizarre monsters, and the constant feeling that everything around you is alive and watching. Levels are procedurally generated, so every run feels unpredictable — sometimes funny, sometimes genuinely scary.
What I really liked is that the game doesn’t hold your hand: you discover the rules yourself and learn how to use the environment and weapons in creative ways. Even glitches here somehow feel like part of the style. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the madness on screen.
That said, it’s not a game for everyone. It can feel chaotic, a bit clunky at times, and if you’re not into surreal “meatcore” aesthetics, this will probably be too much.

This is a very unusual game that combines the horror and roguelike genres.  Every item in the game has hidden properties that you discover by eating it. All items can be eaten, including ordinary consumables and weapons. 

Many notes are scattered around the locations, some of which reveal the properties of items or plot details.

The lobby is also highly interactive. You can find items in it that will help you navigate the locations.

Fans of both genres will enjoy this game. I recommend checking it out!",True,0,0,1757850791,N/A,Steam

I had seen elements of the game and it's bizzare nature beforehand, however i've never really been in contact with any of it's story or the more abstract ideas of its world.
It was explained to me as ""A dungeon crawler where you eat your weapons because they're made of meat"".

I had no idea the world was flesh, and the perception of that same flesh.


Golden Light is one of those games that tells a story that is highly influenced by the point of view you're given. As you go through the game it is almost natural to ask yourself if ""this is really happening"" Or ""if it's all in the head"", You do not go more than a minute free of what the game wants to show you, elements that make you doubt the insanity of the journey you've been going on.

Golden light is not abstract, everything is smudged to be something else, every part of the game, every idea, every wall, every enemy, and even the story. But it is not without sense or reason.
And it's important to say that it both makes sense and doesn't at the same time.

But the most commendable thing with this game is that you are the recipient of emotions, to the point where you stop knowing if a game mechanic is clunky due to poor polishing, or if it was meant to be this clunky so that you feel the way that you do.
This is often felt in scenes aswell, you lose any idea of conventional game devlopment, you can't guess when the game is loading, and if a scene is supposed to stall for this long. 


As you play the game, it connects to your brain in a way your rarely see.
Emotions are being given, images and symbols form connections inbetween your neurons and you are in a way, part of the meat that the game is talking about.


This part has spoilers:
[spoiler]The ending of the game is bittersweet to say the least, but it puts a lot of your adventure in perspective, things now make more sense. And yet it also makes your realise that you can relate to the main character in a way, through emotions, even if you can't feel the exact same biological way... if your brain has an opinion, and emotions regarding this subject, you've connected to the game more than you would have realised[/spoiler]


Anyways, i love this game, it is beautiful, stylized, and the gameplay is clunky but its unique in that way.
If this review sounded insane to you, then you kinda get the vibe of the game.

Each level contains unavoidable traps and gas, randomly spawned around you in such density as to be unavoidable, all serving just to pluck away at your health and money while you wander the pitch blackness looking for keys.

Each enemy respawns infinitely and acts the same, walking up to you and hitting you. Fighting them is pointless and there are hardly any weapons, all of which break in two swings. Guns too, despite being weaker to the point of uselessness and also requiring randomly spawned bullets to be found to even use them.

Thymesia,1245430,19.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561198416188624,"In many ways I thought this was cool, but I did not enjoy it at all.

For one, there are many technical issues. It was pretty difficult to start the game. The first time I got into the safe room, but once I entered the gut the screen just turned black. The second time when I tried to get into the game it just popped me some blank tabs. Only through my 3rd try I managed to successfully get in the game.

Graphically it is a pretty looking game, I like the quite original style. But with heavy pixelation comes a price that sometimes the picked notes are completely illegible.

My main issue is that there was no tutorial (at least on COOP, maybe there was one in single player, I do not know) and everything felt cryptic and strange. I get the idea of how this all could be a fun experience for someone, as it is essentially (I think) random generated levels where you have to find keys to progress to the next floor, you may encounter tons of enemies, traps and find random loot along the way. But after clearing 4 floors with a friend, I found this to be miserable experience. I could scavenge tons of strange items that the game did not reveal what they do; weapons break easily and there were way too many traps everywhere and it was way too easy to die. At least, for a noob to this game, it seemed too harsh, however I can imagine that if I understood how everything worked it would become significantly easier. Some creatures could one hit kill me even when I'm on full health. Some traps take place over a massive area, like something could light the room on fire or poison and it would be almost a guaranteed death. Sometimes most of the level is layered with poison and once poisoned I could not figure out how to get the poisoning effect removed. Overall even when we found the keys and reached the next floor it would give no satisfaction. Melee combat is super clunky and I never got to experience how it is with firearms. When I'd die, I'd become an item which can be picked up by my friend and I could then spectate and help him to navigate, but for some reason the map which I had was super tiny, even when I'd zoom-in, it would still be quite tiny. Everything is off about this game.

But unlike Deep Rock Galactic, each missions are shorter and you don't have a companion to revive you a few times. Playing solo isn't recommended and having at least 3 players is recommended due to higher difficulties. You'll die way more from accidents than you do from enemies. Forced friendly fire and realistic reload is fine. On higher difficulty, enemies alerted and call reinforcement is usually a failed mission. I can not stand the developers' choice to make the camera restrictive and shared in co-op. You can't stray from your team at all but forced to stay with your team all the time because the shared camera. This causes issues of enemies coming out offscreen a lot and you have to wait for your allies to catch up with you if they decide to not follow. Yes, it is better to stick together. But it isn't fun when enemies see you offscreen and you alarm for reinforcement. You're unable to anything while prone is ridiculous. You're able to fire 1H weapon while being knocked down and bleeding out but prone only purpose is to have bullets fly through you. Rarely you want to dive/prone because your allies are should be smart enough to NOT shoot in your direction or you can just sprint/move out of the way.

Gameplay is chaotic and full of very funny moments.

Long and relatively fleshed out progression system and good degrees of difficulty to match, quite grindy though but gives you things to work towards for a long time. Playerbase nowadays is quite small however. 3 Factions with plenty of enemy variety and good build options to adapt to them.

When I started playing it for real a few weeks ago because I loved Helldivers 2 and wanted some perspective on the First War-- I was stunned to realize how well designed and good this game actually was! All of the strategems and weapons of the Helldivers 2 game originated here and there is a reason why  there was a sequel. This game is addictive especially since if you and your friends lose a battle the front line will creep toward Super Earth and you could lose the war. 
    After 10 years it still has a vibrant online community. I say if it goes on sale on Liberation Day October 26th or around that time, check it out! Its really an amazing little game. Its not for everyone and it is NOT a 3rd person shooter like Helldivers 2 but if you like the Helldivers humor and universe, you will enjoy it.",True,0,0,1760666499,N/A,Steam

That's pretty much all I can say.
Should you play it?
Yes.
Is it anything like the second game?
No. It's a completely different game all together.
Will you like it if you played HD2?
Maybe. Depends on what you played for.
Like I said, it plays a lot like Alien Swarm, utilizing similar mechanics from HD2 as obviously HD2's mechanics came from this game so... yeah. Everything is radically different, including weapon customization. You get a few upgrades and can use Research Points to buy them. Each upgrade varies in price. You get RP by leveling up and collecting samples. Armor doesn't have passives, instead it's purely cosmetic, and all the armors look pretty good. The Liberator has a bayonet upgrade. All in all a solid top-down shooter with fun gunplay and strategems to use. Also actually in a playable state unlike HD2 so if you need that itch scratched but cannot STAND the state of the second game definitely give this one a shot. It's also a great way to get acquanted with the upcoming units that are being brought over from this game to the sequel, even tho they will play differently than in HD1 it's still a neat sneak peak into what's coming next.

Tower Defense Simulator,394510,3.99,12,solo/multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198129205272,"At first i wasnt sure if i would like this game. I thought to me „i will refund it anyways and i got the sequel so why bother?“ But boy was i wrong. I love this game. Not because theres some top level graphics, or because i am good which i probably aint. I love this game because of the community and how it feels.

At the beginning i was confused. The muscle memory of clicking one for the primary and two for secondary instead of vice versa was confusing me, and the enemies that were not in the second game did that too. But i got used to it. The movement was also new to me. To move the camera the whole team had to move, and i often got confused between the others and myself. Like the last aspect i got used to it. 

Now i dont have hundreds of hours like some, but i cant know what will happen later and if i will actually get that far. The gameplay is very nice, smooth and fun. The weapons feel smooth, the gunplay does also. Its always a challenge to dive and every helldive doesnt feel like the last. Theres many features the sequel has and the original doesnt, yet it has some i would love to see in the sequel. Features like equipping multiple of the same stratagems, vehicles like APCs and tank destroyers and other things. 
The graphics are nice with an unique touch to it, not to realistic and not to blocky, something in the middle. The UI is also clean. Unlike in Helldivers 2 here your screen isnt littered with objectives on one side and your team on the other and most UI only shows up when you press tab.

I had also great moments with the players. No matter if a low level or the top 5 cyborg player, all of them were very nice and some of them teached me important things about the game. The Helldivers series isnt a cashgrab like many games of today and neither is it a grindfest, its a great series with a wholesome nice and polite community, great moments and much more. I recommend Helldivers one for people who maybe started with the sequel as i did as it gives them a chance to experience what some of you OG Helldivers did in the past. This game is great like the sequel and still fun to play.

Overall great game. 10/10 seeing how it still holds up today and the fun i had fighting in the first galactic war. Really impressive. I got really nothing bad i can think of right now

This game is riddled with problems that most players overlook: frequent crash to desktop incidents (just like Magicka), disconnecting from servers (and losing all your progress), invisible hit boxes that prematurely cause weapons to explode. Arrowhead needs to learn to spend more time with their games in a QA process.

I bought this as a ""party game"" for multiple family or friends to enjoy together but it's nothing but frustration. Aside from the poor software programming that went into this, the game design itself seemed more interested in creating an experience that aims to frustrate more than encourage fun. The illuminates can shoot players from about three screens away, walls randomly appear boxing in players, spawns can happen anywhere, right where you're standing, resulting in an instant-kill, or maybe right on top of a tower you're supposed to defend. Hellpods that bring in other players actually target living players (by programmatical design). The entire game is based around a community contribution experience so you can have the misfortune of ONLY being allowed to fight illuminates (usually the case, since almost nobody enjoys those missions); watch what happens once the Cyborgs and Bugs have been defeated: the player count effectively drops to zero until the galaxy resets.

It's really too bad, like I said in my opening line: Arrowhead makes games on the verge of greatness but can't seem to escape a handful of design decisions that ruin the overall experience. Somebody in the design room literally sat back and said to themselves ""What would be the most challenging thing we could throw at players, whether fair or not?"" without asking the question whether the challenges enhanced or took away from the overall player experience.

Tower Defense Simulator,394510,3.99,12,solo/multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198000983922,"The game makes one really questionable design decision that made me hate it.

A friend and I bought the game with the intention of playing together. We just so happened to start playing at the end of a global campaign or whatever they call it. What that means is that after we finished the tutorial and could join each other, there was only one enemy force we could fight: the machines, which I think are considered the hardest enemy type for beginners. The other two enemy forces had been totally eliminated already in the global campaign. So we attempted one level 1 mission and failed it, but were eager to dive back in and try again, but at this point the campaign entered some kind of ""Final Battle"" mode where every player in the world had something like 24 hours to cumulatively win enough missions to gain a total victory over the final remaining enemy force. But this also locked us into only being able to play these final battle missions, which start at level 3.

Being total noobs at the game with no experience and no upgrades, it was way too hard for us to take on these harder difficulty missions before we had a chance to learn the ropes and upgrade our gear on some of the lower difficulty missions first. No problem, we thought, we'll wait a day for the players to win and the campaign will get reset back to the beginning with easier difficulty missions and all varieties of enemy forces. But what actually happened was there were not enough players doing the missions to win within the 24 hours, but there were enough to keep entering the ""final battle"" state. So in essence, the 24 hour timer kept resetting. Day after day. We checked every day for a couple of weeks but it was always stuck in that ""final battle"" state of the global campaign.

After doing some research, I found a way to bypass the global campaign by disabling cloud saves and essentially running the game disconnected from the global campaign and we managed to play together that way. But it was a time-intensive, hacky workaround that involved making backup copies of the early campaign save file, playing one mission, at which point the game would connect to the servers and see the universe was at the final battle, so then I'd have to quit the game and restore the backed up campaign file again, start the game up, invite my friend to join me and do one mission before starting the process over again.

By the time the global campaign actually reset back to the beginning my friend had dropped off playing because there was too much friction to enjoy it while it was stuck at the end of the campaign. I was still interested in playing and had been making some decent progress solo using my ""disconnected"" workaround, but when I went to rejoin the early stages of the global campaign I also re-enabled cloud saves so I could easily play on my PC or my Steam Deck. Instead of keeping the character I'd spent 14 hours playing with, the cloud save overwrote all progress I had made in the past month and reset my character to where it was when I had disabled cloud saves. My character was essentially back to being a total noob, having completed the tutorial and failed a few missions. No upgrades, no unlocks. All gone and reset to zero. That totally destroyed any motivation I had to keep playing.

I think if we had happened to buy the game when the global campaign was at an earlier state and had been able to work our way up to competently completing level 3+ missions before being locked in to that difficulty, we probably would have had a lot of fun and spent dozens of hours playing the game. But because of the design decision to force everyone into a global campaign with no way of experiencing other enemy types or character level-appropriate mission difficulties, we had a very disappointing first impression and every effort to have fun with it was met with a lot of friction and resistance.

The fun parts that are in the game and should be there for every player were locked and there was nothing we could do to unlock them. It was beyond our control. It felt a lot like a group project where the other people you depend on don't do their part and so you get a failing grade. That one design decision probably changed this from a game I would have loved and spent dozens of hours playing to one I put in way more time trying to bypass this silly restriction before finally giving up and losing interest in wasting more time on it.",False,15,3,1749281589,N/A,Steam

As someone with several hours in GMOD, I truly appreciate the culture this game has built on and evolved. It captures that same sense of creativity, fun, and community but with its own unique personality.

The variety of mini-games is a blast, and there’s always something new to jump into. Whether you’re competing, exploring, or just hanging out, there’s a strong social aspect that brings players together in a way few games manage these days.

I enjoy all the activities Tower Unite offers, and it’s clear the game has plenty of room to grow. The dedicated dev team is constantly improving things and seems genuinely passionate about the project. It’s refreshing to see developers so involved and committed.

I was a long time player of GMod Tower, Tower Unite's predecessor, and when I first heard about this game, I was worried. I backed the Indiegogo campaign, and as soon as I got access, I was playing. I've been off and on again, as other games catch my interest, but I've kept an eye on Tower, and often return.

Honestly, it has issues at times, but I feel that most of the issues are peanuts in comparison to the lack of content in other social games.

I've bought this game for multiple people, who have all enjoyed it, including my sister (who otherwise just plays Sims 4 and Minecraft), my fiance, and my best friend (who otherwise plays Age of Empires 2 and Counter-Strike: Source).

For those who like party games, this is also a great game. You can do a variety of different things such as bowling, a kart racer, arcade games and billiards, etc. Participating in these activities rewards you with various currencies that you can spend on items that you can place in any ""condo"" that you own, such as a nightclub, movie theater, apartment, etc. There's also workshop support so that you can replace your player avatar with other characters, or even get objects to place in your condo.

There's various different seasonal events during different times of the year, but even if you miss an event the rewards are still available if you go to the right shopkeepers in the plaza. However, if you want to take part in the holiday themed event activities, you will have to play during the correct time of year. Whether you are playing during a holiday event or not however, this is a much more fun experience if you bring friends along for the fun.

Condo customization is rather extensive. You can not only place various items around to do some interior decorating, but you can also toy around with the textures and such to really make these spaces your own. Some of the items you can place are even interactive, such as musical instruments or a pool table or even a TV. You can invite some friends over to become a music band together, or watch videos on the TV, or even emulate your favorite retro games provided you dump the files onto your PC.

There's also a great many other things to discover in this game, such as the pets you can ""purchase"" with your in-game reward money. My only real nitpick is that you can create private sessions to play in your condo alone or with friends, but you can't do the same for the plaza. It can be annoying dealing with other people sometimes, and it would be nice to be able to set up private sessions to go bowling or play in the arcade or etc. Either way though, that is ultimately just a nitpick and it doesn't stop the game overall from being a blast to play.

See to other reviews if you don’t care about this.

Short version:
You cannot host a private plaza dedicated server like you used to, neither can you have a private session with your friends anymore. (You can however set your private condo to friends-only if you host from the game client from what I’ve understood)

Longer version:
As someone who used to play this game every day (not on this account) many years ago I was so excited to pick this up again seeing how much it had evolved over time only to find they’ve removed the ability to host a private plaza and have essentially forced most of the interactions into the public sphere. Their reasoning for doing this makes sense but it sounds more like an excuse rather than a justified reason because they could have made it so people who wishes to host a private game were simply forbidden from using these private characters and any asset on public servers. I understand this requires more work but having come from the time this game allowed this made it really disheartening to discover after my excitement. ☹

Maybe someday the developers will again grace us introverts with the ability to host our fully private version away from the public hoi polloi of business. Until then I cannot recommend this game for people like me.

The moderators / devs will mute, kick, ban you for literally having an opinion that does not match their weird ideology. The game is filled with NSFW condos with porn (inc. minors) which do not get banned and are openly promoted, with most players supporting these and getting very aggressive if you voice that you're against it, but are not punished as the devs support this, also allowing p*dos to play the game. But don't you worry! you could tell someone to shut up and a select group of NSFW obsessed players will @moderators and get you punished immediately! but if you're called names and harassed by creepy old men who prey on the young women in this game, thats fine, moderators / devs don't care about that!

The devs also are happy to ban certain players from speaking in game, messaging, hosting condos, etc which basically stops them from playing the game as it was advertised and meant to be played, which i am pretty sure is illegal but pop off i guess?

The only positive thing about this game for me is building in condos, which is the only thing i do on this game, anything else could get you banned in 5 seconds. New minigames have not been added to the game in a long time, and recent ones are quite frankly boring within one day, and for a game that is no longer considered early access you'd expect a lot more in it!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I've seen a common theme, which I forgot to add to this review, and have continued to see this theme in the comments below of how the community needs to report the things that happen in this game and that we ""cannot expect mods to be able to moderate the whole community"". My response to this is, why can't we expect that? It's their job, right?, I don't see myself getting paid to go around reporting all the things wrong with this game, every other game manages to moderate their game themselves. Of course its ok for community to help report some issues, but, ultimately, its up to the moderators to do their jobs.

The moderators in this game are not clear on what is / isn't allowed in the game, and more often than not appear 'trigger happy' to punish players for very little things, such as my ""censored by moderators"" text message which according to devs deserved a timeout, while, at the same time thats happening, theres NSFW condos that are not being moderated with underaged content, its all well and good saying its not allowed in ToS, but its still happening?


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1]EDIT 2:[/h1]

Thanks for the reply, MacDGuy. 

You did respond to parts of what I raised in this review, but you also dodged the core issues I raised.

In relation to the Discord incident. You say the rules are “clearly written,” yet nowhere in those rules does it state that mentioning or advertising a banned user’s condo is against the rules. That was the exact reason my image was removed.
If this is a rule, please point to where it’s written.

Wheezher claimed the image was removed because the banned user had been removed from the game for creating an unsafe environment. Two problems with that:
The rules still don’t say anything about “no promoting a user after they’re banned."",
The user in question isn’t even banned; they are still active on the game.

I then re-posted the same image, this time censoring the advertisement and replacing it with “[censored by moderators].”
This was also not against the rules; it was satire. Staff simply didn’t like being playfully mocked and issued a 1 day time-out.

After my review went up, that 1-day suddenly became a 7-day ban.
Wheezher claimed it was “unrelated” due to a prior infraction, the fact that the ban duration wasn't updated until hours later highlights there's a lack of effective moderation tools, and the timing makes it look retaliatory for the negative review.

Why was the image actually removed, and why was the Discord time-out applied?
These questions remain unanswered, and your reply reads like a deflection.

If you are fine with allowing NSFW content on this game, you shouldn't need to rely on player reports; you should be able to moderate them by yourselves. This is the reason why no other game allows it.

Since my review has been up, I've received several strongly worded and aggressive comments in response. For new players or anyone considering this game, this is exactly what I raised in my review, and it really doesn't help to disprove that the community can create a hostile environment over the most trivial things. This is the same in the official Tower Unite Discord - if you voice an opinion that differs from others, you receive the exact same treatment. The moderation team seems to show a lot of bias when it comes to allowing/punishing this behaviour

This will be my final edit for this review, as I feel I have clearly stated my thoughts above. Thanks!",False,22,5,1755785863,N/A,Steam

I will not repeat those again and instead tell you about my own, personal gripes with Tower Unite.

I enjoy building in games. It is very fun and relaxing to me. I have been working on my condo (Your own personal home which you can decorate) piece by piece in the ~ 300 hours I played.

[u]However, the game actively fights you at every turn if you want to build. [/u]

I have had to deal with: 

-The game instantly closing itself when editing Condo IO objects.

-Condo IO objects not having any matching connection types (Imagine trying to change some lamp setting through an IO object and all you get is being asked if you'd like it turn invisible or visible instead of on or off.)

-Extreme host lag. If more than 8 people play on my condo, my game becomes a slide show.

-Removal of the undo button??

-Some items being precolored. This means that, if you place a table and want to color match it to a white wall and change its color in the wheel to white? Guess what! The base color of the table is brown and therefore can only be ugly tones of brown, making the colorwheel useless on these items.

-EXTREME inconsistency in artstyle and direction. Imagine trying to build a forest. You buy an assortment of trees. You go to place them and notice one tree is photo-realistic, one tree looks like plastic and another looks like it's from a cartoon style game. This will make your condo look like clown vomit within seconds. It is awful.

-Super limited textures for alterable items. Why only give me half the textures that this game even has?

-Constant glare. Some things in this game always look like plastic. Rocks have the look of painted styrofoam and damn near every wood texture shines like it's been waxed and polished. The worst offenders of this are metal items. These textures are straight up broken. Half of all items in the game that have any bits of metal on them at all appear as black voids unless you crank the lighting to painful degrees and then you get like mario 64 type metal blob looking things.

-Inconsistent pricing. You want wall bushes? 50 units. You want normal bush? 300. Some items cost so stupidly much that furnishing more elaborate places becomes a pain. Now I know you can farm money relatively easily in this game, but if you are like me and have played this in Gmod already, you are probably sick of these games. I am sick of Virus. I'm sick of Zombie Massacre and I'm so so sick of minigolf and the others. Making me play hundreds of hours of outdated minigames or sit down for 100 consecutive rounds of bingo so i can furnish my library with the chairs I like sucks. 

I could go on and on and on. My friends cant even play with me anymore because their modern day PCs shut down when trying to join my condo because of how badly this game runs. And what's the point of a social game where being social is the worst part? I wanna be social by building something cool and having people explore that. This game, however, forces me through many hundreds of hours of grind and hinders me with its inconsistent style and poor, small selection of items to do that. Instead I am meant to be social by playing the same Zombie Massacre map 50 times in a row so I can have enough cash to build. And why build if the game is so poorly optimised that fulfilling my artistic vision means crashing my and other's game upon trying to join? 


In the end...
It's just not fun. I really don't get it.

Ultrakill,1229490,18.74,0,solo,"Action, Indie, Early Access",76561198971094114,"For a shooter that is supposed to be all about the SSStyle most enemies sure don´t react in any meaningful way to the majority of your shots. This means that the ""player expression"" is more of a facade than anything else as it pushes you to vary up your weapons for variety's sake and little else. The ranking is mostly superfluous aside from it helping with your hp regeneration, but even then the stylish part itself is not that engaging, at least in DMC, when you style on something you get to combo and lock down said enemies in the air as a result of your skills, but without significant stagger it loses much of its appeal.

Arena and boss design is similarly vapid due to this rigidity. With so little crowd control aside from the techniques to maximize dps, most enemy rooms turn into clusterfucks of projectiles where you spam the blood regen to tank the shots, and the bosses are mostly simplistic pattern memorization fights, where not even parries stops their onslaught, which makes such manoeuvres feel flaccid despite offering a lot of benefits in regenerating your health and dealing damage.

While not totally devoid of cool ideas as seen by the coin ricochets and some cool weapons, it is a game that has ridden more on its hype rather than the substance of its mechanics. The mark of amateurish design is to be seen everywhere, like how, for example, the game has secret collectables for you to pick up, but also simultaneously punishes you in your ranking for taking too long to explore the level.

it saved me from loneliness on more occasions that i would like to admit and i found most of my friend in that game.
i also get to explore all kinds of visually stunning worlds wether it being photorealistic worlds or art driven world.

I've personally had some of the most enjoyable times, enlightening conversations, and the closest connections I could've ever imagined. I've also seen some of the most vial, gross and downright reprehensible content spread here. It's a polarizing tugging of both ends of the spectrum. Vile language and frequent inappropriate content are frequent in public lobbies due to the lack of moderation. A good strategy is to get some close friends or a tightknit community to hang out with in private lobbies, and avoid public lobbies aside from most games. You should be fine then, but be prepared if something else should arise. The block button is a wonderful feature, and you should not be afraid to use it if someone is being offensive or reprehensible.

If you're a parent looking at reviews to get a gauge on if this game is okay for your kids, wait until they turn 18 for their own sake.
If you're a child thinking you're mature enough, you are not. Wait until your 18 for your own safety, and thank me later.
If you're over 18, You're an adult. Go in with an open mind, and you'll be surprised at some of the pleasant folk that wander some of the quieter corners of the community.",True,0,0,1764153852,N/A,Steam

In reality it’s:

> A multiverse where a hyper-real anime girl, a 2-polygon Shrek, and a 9-foot robot are all arguing in front of a mirror at 3 a.m.

You *can* use a VR headset… or just play in Desktop and experience 10% of the immersion and 200% of the social anxiety.

---

### Pros

* Thousands of community-made worlds: nightclubs, horror maps, movie theaters, flight sims, hangout rooms, McDonald’s roleplay, therapy couches, and a guy’s extremely detailed apartment for some reason.
* Fully custom avatars: anime, furry, robot, fridge, eldritch abomination, literal brick – if Unity can import it, someone is already using it as their personality.
* Lip sync, eye tracking, full-body tracking – you haven’t lived until you’ve seen someone in full mocap doing cursed Fortnite dances in a medieval tavern.
* VR *not* required, which is great if you want to stare at a mirror with strangers without putting on a headset.
* Social sandbox: people host talk shows, concerts, church, D&D sessions, group therapy, and also the weirdest parties you’ll never tell your parents about.

---

### Cons

* “Free to play” but not free from social chaos. Public lobbies range from wholesome to “I need to log off forever” in under 30 seconds.
* Performance: your PC is fine until someone loads in with a 400k-poly avatar with realtime reflections and 8K textures. Then it’s a slideshow.
* You join for “a quick look,” you leave 5 hours later after emotionally bonding with a British raccoon model named “Dave.”
* Safety filters, trust ranks, and content controls exist, but like any big social space, you still have to use the mute & block buttons like a gunslinger.
* If you get into avatar/world creation, say goodbye to your free time. It’s just you, Unity, and 47 compiler errors at 4 a.m.

---

### Peak VRChat Moments

* Joining a “chill hangout” world and walking straight into a full-blown courtroom roleplay in progress.
* Going to a horror map and bravely leading the group… until the first jumpscare, at which point you become background decoration.
* Accidentally wandering into a deep, heartfelt conversation about life with three people you will never see again, all dressed like cursed cereal mascots.
* Spending two hours in a mirror world doing nothing but talking, posing, and occasionally questioning how this became your main game.

Struggling to develop my review as all of my experiences have been bad there since the first time I tried, so I guess I will just give pros and cons.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
 • Be what you want as long as you have your model to import.
 • If you don't have your own model, many are available to get in game.
 • Playable on PC and VR.
 • Various worlds with many purposes, such as games, exploration, or a simple home to relax in.
 • Customization is almost limitless, but...

[h3]Cons[/h3]
 • ... extremely complexe to create and to setup, especially compared to competitors
 • Community is very closed. Don't join hoping meeting people. Join with your own friends.
 • SteamLink terribly unstable depending on setups.
 • Subscription options too much highlighted. It almost jumps to your eyes on the menu, and happens to appear on loading screens.

[h3]Subjective points[/h3]
 • None comes in mind, feels like experience is black or white (but mostly black)

[h3]Final note[/h3]

But back thern  its content was pretty damn anemic.

A big part of the major content that has been introduced since then can be found in the DLCs, but there were also plenty of updates to the base game.

The result of this is that there is at least something to do in this game unlike many lesser titles.
There is a sizable number of unlocks, a clear progression path of what to do and unlock next, many different stages with some unique gimmicks and plenty of hidden secrets.

If you go for full completion you will be busy for a while and even if you arent then the variety can be entertaining for a while.

That said, this is still the game that survivor-likes come from and therefor does not innovate upon the genre.
For the most part it really is just the same eternal loop of pickung up a few weapons and upgrading them until the entire screen explodes and the game becomes hard to look at.

I can't play more than a few matches in a row because it feels very unrewarding and... I dunno, unfun. It sucks the joy of playing video games out of me as I try to play it.

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to progress. Knowing who to use or what stage to complete for the next unlock you need to continue in the game itself is completely unclear.

You can unlock stages well before you have the upgrades to beat them. Exclamation points draw you to stages that have seemingly no objective left to complete.

And worst of all, every match either feels too easy or is frustratingly impossible. You can either walk the map with impunity, as if there were no mobs spawning around you, or you're being hopelessly overwhelmed and were doomed from the start, regardless of choice and skill.

The developers continue to add content (free & paid DLC) so those that enjoy the title will have even more to play with time if this practice continues.[/b]

I would begrudgingly recommend Vampire Survivor's to roguelike fans with the disclaimer that the game is slow & tactile (in regards to movement as the game attacks for you) before evolving whilst degrading into an addicting & stimulating AFK power fantasy built around discovering & merging specific items together.

[I]A few notes before elaboration as to why I did not recommend Vampire Survivors.[/I]

[list]
[*]Combat plays itself, you move around avoiding the AI while positioning yourself so that your weapons can hit them.

[*]The meat of the game comes from weapon fusions & the power fantasy of killing hordes without being hit, something that is rarely possible at the start.

[*]Runs are always restricted to 30 minutes with few exceptions or until you unlock an endless gamemode.

[*]Menu & UI elements have to be unlocked via gameplay including a progression guide (Unlocks), a bestiary (it lacks clear information of enemy weaknesses), Permanent upgrades (health, luck, speed etc.), Arcanas (Modifiers), Gamemodes (Hyper (Sped up gameplay), Endless, Inverted (Flipped map)) & more.

[*]There are a lot of items, characters & secrets that require dedicated playtime to unlock & earn new weapons. This can make progression feel like a slog as you're required to play unfun characters.
In regards to fusing weapons, unless you have external sources helping, numerous runs boil down to 15 minutes of trial & error.

[*]The UI fails to provide clear & necessary information during runs including how weapons/stats interact with upgrades, their names, strength, effects and more importantly for late game, how they interact with other weapons(fusion). Not to mention that during mid-late game runs the UI & enemies are blown out by the weapon effects, so they become hidden amongst the effects.

[*]Despite the large item/weapon list, character choice rarely matter & builds homogenise after a few hours of play, even more so if you use the optional egg buff mechanic (but that's up to player choice).

[*]As you gain more weapons & passives in a run, the actual gameplay devolves into standing AFK while Area of Effect strikes wipe the board and there's very little movement/gameplay involved unless you select specific characters you may not enjoy.

[*]p.s. You can skip case openings by pressing ESC on your keyboard but it won’t skip for super lucky crates. (This is more of a PSA if you play the game).
[/List]

[H2] Elaboration [/H2]
[H3]Progression & Information Clarity[/H3]
Game/Progression direction drops off a cliff at some point and while there is an Unlock tab in the menu & this is your guide on what you're supposed to do besides survive in a level, they are vague which is fine but after at a certain point it's too vague to be reasonable without third party assistance. This mostly occurs around the time you reach Capella Magna for the first time as a result of certain characters being ineligible for “story” progress or being able to trigger the unlock requirements for further progression; those being Mortaccio, Cavallo, Ramba, O’Sole & Ambrojoe.
 
[H3]Characters[/H3]
The large roster of characters despite having stat variance play the same and are essentially hosts to their starting weapon, your selection of character will depend on the weapon more than the character. Certain characters are better than the rest as a result, Pugnala & her dual welding pistols, the priest & his bible, Cleric & the holy water have staple weapons that provide Area of Effect and strength starting you closer to endgame while characters like Krochi & his axe or the starting characters are mono target strikers that have you praying for AoE weapons at level up.

The mid-late game characters are more interesting by having additional properties alongside their weapons like Cavallo’s scaling projectiles or they have risky pay offs like Giovanna’s self-harming Cats that scale based on item consumption (none of which is explained in game).

External assistance (wiki’s, guides etc.) are near mandatory for mid-late progression and the starting map is more difficult than the later maps.
 
[H3]Weapons[/H3]
Weapon unlocks, they are fun to stumble upon during your multiple runs but if you're trying to figure out a combination without using third party sources it can take numerous 10+ minute runs. I understand ""Fail to learn"" is the name of the game but unlike enemy pathing & understanding how different weapons are helpful in the early game, the evolution system is just a nuisance.

Weapon combinations which is the meat of the power fantasy require an asinine amount of fails runs to work out given the amount of items & weapons in the game. The game auto attacks for you so gameplay comes down to tactical positioning & movement but after unlocking new items & purchasing account upgrades, movement becomes irrelevant as after the 10-20 minute mark gameplay to devolves into undecipherable full visual effects, afking & screen wipes; all of which obscure the UI, enemies & map.
 
The early game Weapons, passives & account upgrades are gained through failed & successful runs with respective characters, which is fine given Vampire Survivor’s is a roguelike but the early characters & their associated weapons suck to play with in more than just player strength as the starting character weapons aren’t sustainable and the reliance on a specific weapon (garlic) is near mandatory until later options are unlocked. Basically you’ll spend around 20 minutes with a character you don’t like to unlock their weapon which is required to get a sustainable version of itself or another.
 
[H3]Secrets[/H3]
Uncovering secrets and completing quests aka “Unlocks” can either be reasonable or asinine. Best case scenario you unlock the progression or UI items on each map as you progress like the unlock screen, map, bestiary, grimoire (weapon fusion guide) etc. that reveal unlocks, items, characters & a few secrets on the map.

Worst case scenario you miss them or you unlock & use a character (that’s not explained in game) that is ineligible for “story” events, so you follow the poorly explained unlock screen, complete levels, survive the full 30 minute level duration multiple times, obtaining weapons & items and fuse them together only to find out you have to use another character to progress & unlock new game modes, items, characters & more.

This completely breaks the balance and progression for duo play. How are we even supposed to reach the Grim Reaper (30-minute mark) with only 2 upgrades? Some weapons (like Peachone and Ebony Wings) are already useless early on without evolving, and now evolution is basically impossible because you can’t hold both needed weapons.

I started playing this game with another person, and we wanted to unlock everything only by playing duos. We put around 10 hours in - having fun, progressing steadily - then suddenly there’s an update, and this massive change hits without any mention in the patch notes. No explanation, no reasoning. Our progress didn’t just slow down - it pretty much died.

I’m not interested in using cheat codes or having one player sit out just so the other can unlock things. Why even make coop mode if you’re going to cripple it like this?

It (the enjoyment above) started with many friends saying that I should check out Slay The Spire (SS from now on) and that game hooked me in.

Vault of the Void,1102190,7.49,0,solo/multiplayer,Strategy,76561197971261352,"Monster Train is a very, very good game. It's inferior in most aspects to Slay the Spire, although not in all. Design wise it's heavily leaning toward combinations - less cards per ensemble, but out of the box ability to combine two ensemble that is not just a quasi-gimmick like the prismatic shard in Slay the Spire but actually designed for that. Similarly the playing board has extra dimensions - floors, numbers of entities on both sides - while the card play itself is more limited (although still very much existent and deep). Art is nothing remarquable although it's reasonably pleasant. Music is catchy. While I prefer StS on all of those aspects, it's a matter of taste. What is not though is the fact that the UI is way less polished/well thought than Slay the Spire, by far my biggest issue with the game. It's nothing disastrous but coming from StS, oof. Issues include inability to see the whole board at once (for no reasons other than aresthetic at the -severe- expense of clarity and responsiveness - a major crime shared by Inkulinati, who thinks those constant zoom in zoom out are any good? Jesus.), discard UI that has the wrong trajectory for card pick making discarding the wrong one the default results if you don't circle around things, an enthousiasm for playing card you released 34 thousands mile away from away from a floor after deciding you didn't want to play it on that floor (which it absolutely will nonetheless). In general they were many other things that could have been done but weren't so that the information was less bloated. Lots of numbers without bars, lack of hierarchy in the tool tips... make it very easy to miss informations and give up on learning by the game rule, instead just trying stuff. Which is... doable but StS precisely shown that you could be *actually playing* the game from the first minute, having all the information you need to make decisions. 

It does share a cons with StS which is no undo/restart the fight but it's vastly more problematic because of the above, the facts that a lot of the time you have to play shit to simply get the rule the tool tip wasn't 100% clear about etc. Nothing bad in itself but it's a bit dumb to have to quit to the main menu en re enter the game to restart it. 
While this all may sound negative let me reiterate this is down the line a brilliant game though. It's *extremely* catchy, packed with interesting mechanics and a solid execution of those. The cost in money is nothing here, it's more about how willing you are to put your finger in the cogs and get eaten by the game.

It's probably not the main thing most people cared about, but the previous game had genuinely good writing, interesting and varied character designs, the interesting worldbuilding, factions with internal diversity that still maintained thematic coherence, and carefully varied mechanics that allowed for a wide variety of solutions to every game problem, allowing you to feel clever when you pulled off a particularly niche or non-obvious build. This game offers none of that - it does have more spectacle, it has bigger numbers, everyone's power level is through the roof, but the vibe, to me, the bits that tie it all together, is just... gone.  The writing quality is through the floor, the careful and surprisingly deep worldbuilding of the previous game replaced with ""lolrandom"" humour, and a lot of it is just completely undercooked or not well thought out. The power scaling and powers make everything *extremely* swingy, as well.

This is even reflected in less obvious elements like the UI (which is often missing important information - it doesn't even say what the faction leaders do anymore, and information about their lore is well hidden) and the artwork in general (which looks like it was done by several different artists who didn't collaborate much).

Let's compare factions, for a second, by looking at the wealth-based factions. In the old game, it was the Melting Remnant, a section of hell that believed that the melting away of wax released the soul, and was split into two factions, the pious and orderly class of devotees and priests who tended to their flames, and the uncouth street toughs who lived for material wealth, represented by a burning priest wielding two maces and empowering others with his leadership and an eternally young street urchin willing to fight and die as many times as it could to win. They even had their own section of the map you passed through on your journey.

The Monster Train 2 equivalent is the Pyreborn, a faction of dragons, with two leaders - the greedy skinny dragon and his wife the greedy fat dragon who makes fun of him for being poor despite being obsessed with money (in cutscenes)and who are both actively disinterested in the cause for which they fight.

When you think of trains, you think carriages, yet every battle takes place on a single one with 3 tiers and you protect the pyre at the top. I honestly don't know why the game wasn't built around having a long train and you had to protect the engine with battles in each carriage instead? Would be a much better and appropriate format IMO. 

The UI is cluttered for what it is, the balance is either too easy or too difficult, and visually the game feels cheap and generic. Also it just lacks the fluidity of comparable deck builders and this comes from the strange battle design and convoluted interface. Thankfully you know very early on when a run is going to be an early bust.

I've played 4 runs, all with different faction combinations; won 3 with minimal resistance, always playing on the maximum difficulty the game would allow.

All runs seem to revolve around creating a ""perpetual motion machine"" with your deck, I.E. a set of cards you can rapid fire with little thought while watching numbers balloon to absurd and broken heights, and then as each stage draws to a close, hope the numbers have increased sufficiently to survive the end boss. If they haven't, there's next to nothing you can do anyway, but that rarely even comes close to happening.

Maybe I've been spoiled by the Culdcept series, but the variety of cards and the breadth of possible strategies seems severely lacking, and while there's some enjoyment to be had picking and choosing options for the deck, actually playing it is pretty dull. Each run goes for about 4 hours, and I feel it should have been 1/4 that much. The game expects you to do A LOT of grinding. It ""unlocks"" new features with a glass dropper, and the new features do little to spark interest anyway.

It's got too many mechanics, which at first may seem like a good thing, but it ends up being overwhelming. The other thing that put me off it is that balance is all over the place; things scale too much too fast and the deck-building aspect of the game ends up being unimportant. Only in the first few battles you'll have to think strategically how to use your resources to defeat the enemy but it really won't matter much since numbers are low and they'll barely do any damage to your Pyre (the thing you have to protect which one-shots any low-level monster that gets near it), while by the middle of the run the enemies can knock you fast if you don't have the right cards to stop them. In a run you'll have 20-30 cards in your deck but your actual build will be just one or two overpowered monsters that you keep using the same buffs on one over and over or triggering the same effect over and over.

Then there's the artifacts, which are also unbalanced af, some give you a minor situational buff, or help with certain cards which you may or not get more that one or two of, and there's others that pretty much win the run for you, like the one that instantly summons four of your monsters on the first turn regardless of cost or size - I already got that artifact twice in ten or so runs and it makes it virtually impossible to lose. I haven't even unlocked all the factions but I expect them to play similar or introduce more mechanics that end up not mattering or being completely broken.

I feel about this game the same way I feel about Balatro, another overwhelmingly positive rated game that lost it's appeal after a few hours when I realized it's all about doing the same thing over and over again, getting op powerups and watching the numbers get bigger and bigger, eschewing any need for strategy or careful planning.

So why do I not recommend it?

That's because the gameplay feels kinda off in a lot of places, making the overall experience feel quite unsatisfying. To give a quick overview of how a run goes without getting into details: You select a primary and allied clan to play with, determining your starting cards, and then the game is a loop of choosing 1 of 2 paths to use all shops, events, etc... on that path, fight a group of enemies in an encounter and repeat until you beat the final boss. An encounter sees wave after wave of enemies start on the bottom floor and make their way up the train to attack your core.

1. Upgrades are too impactful. As an example, one of the weakest upgrades for spells is ""+10 spellpower"", if you apply this to a damaging spell, it causes that spell to do 10 extra damage. The ""problem"" is that your starting damaging spells will likely be something like ""deal 2 damage"", so this ""weak"" upgrade straight up makes that spell 6 times as powerful. These big and easy powerspikes result in making getting stronger feel pretty unsatisfying. Other games in the roguelike genre, typically have upgrades be more gradual, like slay the spire for example, where you can upgrade a 5-damage strike into an 8-damage strike+.

2. Enemies jump in strength too quickly. This goes hand-in-hand with the 1st point, because the problem isn't that enemies outscale you, the problem is that they need to get big jumps in strength in order to keep up with your uprades, but this does very quickly invalidate your non-upgraded cards. overall it contributes to this unsatisfying feel the game has. Also, within a wave itself enemies differ wildly, one enemy will have 95 health, and the enemy right behind them will have 4, the idea is that the lower health enemies are easy to kill, but hard to reach, so it does make sense from a balancing pov, yet it still contributes to this unsatisfying feeling I've been talking about.

3. Enemies move too quickly. Each round, every ally and enemy on each floor will attack once, and then the enemies move up to the next floor, if they reach the 4th floor, they'll start damaging your core. So your goal is to build a defense that's able to kill each wave of enemies before they reach the top. My problem however, is that combat feels way too short, each ally will only get 1 attack round on each enemy wave, and vice versa, this again isn't a problem from a balancing perspective, but it ends up feeling unsatisfying.
Luckily, the final boss of each encounter does stay on their current floor until all your troops or they are defeated. Getting to test your defenses in a fight to the death is definitely the highlight of each encounter, but it also makes me wish that the rest of the encounter (which takes up the majority of your time), was more like it.

I don't think the game has actual balancing issues, yet every time I win a run, it felt unsatisfyingly easy, and every time I lost a run, it just felt unavoidable.",False,1,0,1736280628,N/A,Steam

Once you play a unit on a certain floor, that's it, you can't play the unit again this fight (except if you upgrade that card with a special rune) and you can't move the unit to other floors (except with spells). The only other choices you get regarding that unit is whether you play other units in front or behind and whether you play spells on it. 

After all the units have been played, you're cycling through the cheap spells, waiting for the better spells to draw. 

[h1]Waiting out bossfights is wasting the your time[/h1]

When all waves are cleared and the boss enters the first floor, units will repeatedly take turns hitting each other, until either your units are dead or the boss is dead. There is nothing you can do, besides watch. This is so stupidly boring, that the game teaches you to use the fast forward button during the tutorial. There's no point in watching, since you can't influence it in any way. 

These two designpoints render everything else the game does well, irrelevant.
Music is good, boss gimmicks are neat, challenges are good, menu animations are quick, gameplay mechanics are reasonably readable.

No game I have ever played goes as in depth for so many different systems and mechanics that all intersect beautifully. The movement is top-notch, the melee combat smooth and satisfying, the gunplay is very fun and responsive, the wide array of different Warframes to play as are individually unique and in-depth, and the upgrades systems for each are also very in-depth and compliment eachother well. The story and lore of Warframe, while it may seem very minimal in the earlier hours of the game, is a major part of my personal enjoyment of the game.
The biggest downside of the game, however, is the earliest hours of the game. The game itself does not do a very good job at teaching new players how the upgrades and damage systems work, and will require a LOT of time either researching on the Wiki, or being taught by veteran players. That being said, Digital Extremes have been including ways to streamline the path of the new player with their recent updates to the game such as adding a new quest that teaches new players about how to mod their weapons to deal specific damage types.
Warframe also has the most positive and new-player friendly community I have ever been a part of. Veterans of the game (myself included) are very eager and happy to teach new players how to do everything that the game itself struggles to teach.

You can pay real money to buy mods/frames/weapons from the market but you can grind for them relatively easily. The game is PVE so if you still consider it p2w then thats that.
The gameplay is fun, the shooting feels good and weapons feel unique and impactful. 
You feel the progress for every upgrade you make.
Since this is a grind game, you need to grind to progress which may render progress static if you dont grind daily.
Stages are repetitive but the game offers a variety of game modes you can choose from. 
The game is volatile against internet instability and will isolate you in missions that require a team to finish but you can not really blame the game for that.
Crafting stuff in this game has a timer than can go from few minutes to 3 days max. Obviously you can skip the timer using the currency you buy with real money or by selling stuff in the market. Its bad that the game needs to make money that way and through cosmetics but at least there are a lot of things you can do while waiting for your things to be crafted.
The game has limited slots for everything, so if you think you are going to collect all frames thinks again because you will need to buy slots every now and then with currency you get using real money or by selling stuff in the market. However, slots are relatively cheap and as a f2p you will get a lot by selling stuff on the market. 
Unfortunately, the market is saturated with paying players that everything is relatively cheap, thats good if you want to buy but terrible if you are a f2p and thats the only way you can get currency. 
You can get cosmetics with currency or you can use currency to buy useful things for your build or slots. So cosmetics are the luxury of paying players even though f2p can still use currency in large amounts to buy cosmetics.
So in a nutshell, this game is f2p friendly, it offers shortcuts for people who pay but you can still get everything through grinding.

I honestly don't know why I had never heard of this game until this year. This is a sleeper and has so many things to offer:

Immersive story
Intense Gameplay
Relaxing Gameplay
Base building
Character design
Rogue Lite
Rogue Like
Not Rogue anything
Space Robot Ninja Wizards with Lazer Shotguns and  Quirky Sidekicks
Puzzle Games
Anti Puzzle Games

The list goes on and on. 

Moreover the community is VERY good at not giving out spoilers so you can ingest the game like it was brand new (or not, I'm not telling you how to play). There are many surprises and plenty of ""WTF is going on here?!"" moments that seemingly all get answered over time.

Finally, I'd like to say, you have NOT missed the boat on this one. There isn't a boat, it's a ferry going back and forth, and no matter when you start it's still the right time to start.

Warframe,230410,0.0,17,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, RPG, Free To Play",76561198044280999,"Once a darling of the free to play genre, Warframe has dissappointingly gone the way of so many others and become a mostly corrupt mess. It plays a lot like a mobile game now with timers and gates on everything, constantly demanding your microtransactions to avoid hours and hours of farming, which they also made impossible to do afk. Nerf by nerf, little by little, a once fairly enjoyable experience where you could unlock everything on Cetus in a week or so has become months of grinding Fortuna rep with a faction you dont like so you can get the Xaku warframe from Deimos. But hey thats okay you can avoid that just get out the wallet and pay to make the problem go away.

I played Warframe for years and I've always tried to get people into it, but more and more as time progresses I have to add caveats. You can play a huge open exploration map... unfortuantely half the mining nodes are bugged or placed on the roof where you cant get them. You can play as nearly 100 characters. It takes 8 hours of farming each one but hey you can kinda technically do that thing eventually in three years of playing 8 hours daily. All of the original frames will get nerfed and youll have to unlock new variants like Excalibur Umbra to do anything, following endless story missions that are disperate from one another and dont feel like they contribute to a central story. One second youre killing Vay Hek and the next second hes been dead for 3 years and his zombie is back. The pacing has become an absolute nightmare. There is feature bloat on top of the existing feature bloat and its very easy to break the flow and sequence of the story and be left in narrative limbo wondering what the heck is going on, whos working for who, and why I should even care when nothing has any consequences because you're just space jesus anyway. I've played a lot of the new content (unlocked Nokko, sorta fun, functionally useless compared to similar frames that work a lot less for the same result, but being immortal is cool) and done the Call of the Tempestrati, which was an absolutely abysmal experience about an edgelord, a hamfisted variant of phoenix from valorant, token asian female, token dominatrix female and a 90s tech nerd. Its gonna be tough hacking through all of that trash and dealing with those characters who have been done to death so many times I dont remember a single one of their names. Phoenix is called something like ""Clancy"" and has a sissy white guy name but thats literally all I remember about these characters im apparently supposed to like according to the story. They are utterly forgettable. The samurai guy has a scar over his eye. The british gangster guy unironically says ""SKKKRAAAA"" like youre in a battle with Big Shaq. They all call your character ""Marty"" which is a really funny reference to that joke they did two hours ago where one of the characters called you ""Marty McFlea"" because of your time travelling.

This game used to be about stuffing cyborgs up the asses of mutants because you were the last real human left and now it's about using friendship magic to stop temporal paradoxes in the boopledompf region from causing a cascade resonance in the disseltinkledink and doing a woozlewah, which is really bad for you let me tell you right now, im not going to show you at any point im just going to have characters endlessly babble about it during every mission. In a genre that thrives on ""Show, don't tell"" this games narrative is presented as ""Tell and tell and tell and tell and tell and show 1 second of the problem, then tell and tell and tell and tell..."". Heres 20 character names that will mean nothing to you in an hour. Because Dunbar's number isnt real.

I'm still gonna play this game just out of raw stubbornness. Some kind of sunk cost fallacy, or nostalgia for the times when you could just log on, pop World on Fire, and chat about builds with other Tenno. When the strategy of the studio was to deliver enjoyable content and not to just shit out mobile garbage with time gates to keep you playing for as long as possible, because that increases the odds of you spending. The fact that the mining nodes still dont work properly 15 years later makes it extremely unlikely that I'll ever start Soulframe though. With Warframe quickly running out of ideas the next hare brained installment is going to be pure Chinese mobile game market inspired garbage. The writing is already on the wall. Who even asked for the Wukong warframe? Have you ever seen anyone use it? Lets go with that design for our sequel. The one thing in the entire game that noone likes. People play Atlas for christ's sakes XD",False,2,1,1763493497,N/A,Steam
Warframe,230410,0.0,17,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Action, RPG, Free To Play",76561198873948469,"I put around 1700 hours into Warframe. I grinded everything, pushed through every wall, aimed for endgame, and genuinely loved it. Then suddenly — boom — I’m permanently banned for a chat argument from months ago. Someone provoked me, insulted me, kept poking at me, and I finally reacted. One moment, one sentence — and apparently 1700 hours don’t matter. For some people that’s literally years of grind wiped out instantly.

Here’s the part people really need to understand — because I didn’t, until it was too late:
You don’t need to be insulting someone.
You don’t need to mean anything malicious.
You can literally be joking with your own friends.
You can say something that wasn’t intended to offend anyone at all.
And guess what?
A single moment, a single slip-up, one stupid sentence in clan chat or squad chat — and months later it can still come back and obliterate your entire account. No warning, no “hey, don’t say that,” no nothing. Just instant permanent deletion.
They don’t hand out mutes.
They don’t hand out temporary timeouts.
They go straight for “remove this player from existence.”

After my ban, I started digging into it — and it turns out this nonsense is everywhere. People get banned for harmless jokes, friendly sarcasm, or something taken completely out of context. Even long-term players with perfect histories get wiped instantly. The system doesn’t care what you meant or who you were talking to — it just swings the hammer without thinking.

And here’s the part that really makes you laugh (or rage):
Loyalty means absolutely NOTHING.
1700 hours? Doesn’t matter.
3000 hours? Doesn’t matter.
5000 hours? Still doesn’t matter.
You can be the most dedicated, helpful, legitimate player ever — if you type one wrong word once, even if it wasn’t serious, even if it was friendly banter, even if you were DEFENDING yourself, the system will nuke your account without hesitation. Being loyal? Forget it.

Reaching out to support?
Prepare yourself.
You’ll get the most robotic, emotionless replies imaginable. It’s like they have a menu of preset responses and pick one at random. There’s no real conversation, no context, no attempt to understand anything. You might as well send your ticket to a refrigerator — at least it won’t pretend it cares while giving you copy-paste nonsense.

Let’s be clear: rules are fine. But going straight to PERMANENT deletion over a dumb moment, a sarcastic joke, or a heated argument is ridiculous. It’s like handing someone a life sentence for arguing in a supermarket. Humans joke. Humans argue. Humans get annoyed. Humans make mistakes. But in Warframe? You’re expected to be a flawless, emotionless robot 24/7.

And the most ridiculous part?
Chat is basically the backbone of the entire game.
Trading, recruiting, clans, squads, help channels — without chat, Warframe would collapse. The game relies on communication. Yet the same system that keeps the community alive is also the fastest way to lose your entire account. Want to enjoy the game? Stay away from chat. But without chat… what exactly are you left with?
The irony is painful.

Honestly, once the shock faded, I almost felt relieved. Because the truth? The grind is brutal. I genuinely have no idea how new players survive without spending money. Free-to-play players? Prepare for thousands of hours of grinding. I spent some money — not even much — and even then I barely touched endgame. Without paying, I’d probably still be stuck in the early star chart.

So here’s the final warning:
Warframe is an incredible game — one of the best gameplay experiences out there.
But the chat system?
It’s a landmine waiting for you to step on it.
Step on it once — even by accident, even joking with friends — and your entire account evaporates.

If you choose to play:
Enjoy the gameplay.
Enjoy the combat.
Enjoy the world.

A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator is not a game, it's an e-book that's been dumped on Steam masquerading as a game.  As a visual/interactive novel, this doesn't feature any notable gameplay, it's just a lot of clicking through badly written dialogue that would never have been accepted or published in print, which poses the question, ""How did something this badly written end up on Steam?"".  When someone hoping to become an author is unable to get published in print, they spend $100 and dump their high school fan-fiction onto Steam, under the guise of a game.

I was wondering when this rather infamous marketing campaign from KFC would hit my queue.  And here it is.  It's not a game, first and foremost, it's a CYOA dating sim featuring Col. Harlan Sanders, the bane of all chickens.   This E-book was fronted on Steam by KFC's marketing department, and unsurprisingly went slightly viral.  So this is a parody of other e-books and the purpose is to sell fried chicken.   E-books aren't games, and this fast food advertisement also isn't a game.  Even the Noid game from Dominos had gameplay.  And, ultimately, this needs to be judged by the value it provides to PC gamers here on Steam, and that is none.

While this fast food advertisement E-book is ""free"",  Your gaming rig is not a Kindle, and we deserve better than having Steam be used as a tool of the marketing arms of global corporations.

The only positives I can give are that it's free and takes less than two hours to read in full. So at least if you don't like it, you didn't lose anything monetarily.

     I started my playthrough with high hopes, expecting a whirlwind romantic adventure with the one and only Colonel Sanders. Visions of candlelit dinners, moonlit strolls, and tender moments shared over perfectly fried chicken danced through my head. My heart fluttered at the thought of winning his affections, picturing a happy ending where the two of us would ride off into the sunset, hand in hand, with a bucket of his famous chicken in the backseat. But as I dove deeper into the game, reality hit harder than a deep-fried drumstick.

     Instead of a heartwarming love story, I found myself embroiled in a bizarre, frustrating mess. Every interaction with Mr. Sanders was more confusing than the last, with no clear path to romance in sight. My dreams of sharing sweet nothings with the Colonel were dashed, replaced by cryptic conversations, meaningless tasks, and an utter lack of emotional connection. The game teased me with glimpses of what could have been, only to snatch it away at the last second, leaving me with nothing but disappointment and a sour taste in my mouth.

     By the time I reached the end, I realized that the happy ending I so desperately sought was never going to happen. No tender goodbyes, no romantic confessions—just an empty, unsatisfying conclusion that left me questioning why I even bothered. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME; it's a complete waste of time.

Gráficamente es muy superior, el sonido es espectacular cada disparo, cada explosión se sienten intensamente reales y la jugabilidad sigue siendo su punto más fuerte.Este no es un shooter para cualquiera. Tiene un enfoque más táctico y realista que Call of Duty, pero no llega a los extremos de simulación de Arma, quedando justo en ese punto medio que lo hace tan especial. Su gunplay es excelente, el arsenal está muy bien trabajado, y los mapas y modos están diseñados para ofrecer combates intensos, inmersivos y llenos de tensión. Si encajas con este estilo de juego, es muy probable que te quedes por decenas o incluso cientos de horas.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,jdmsjmsrscgm,"Insurgency: Sandstorm,stands out in the crowded field of first-person shooters with its intense and realistic depiction of modern combat. Launched as the sequel to the original Insurgency, Sandstorm enhances the franchise’s reputation for delivering gritty, tactical gameplay that rewards teamwork and strategy over lone-wolf **** of the most notable aspects of Insurgency: Sandstorm is its commitment to realism. The game eschews the more arcade-like elements found in many of its peers in favor of a more grounded approach. Weapons behave realistically, with significant recoil and authentic ballistics. This makes gunfights tense and deadly, where a single bullet can be fatal. The sound design further amplifies the immersion, with gunfire and explosions resonating with a visceral, bone-rattling intensity that places players right in the heart of the **** tactical gameplay is another strong point. Insurgency: Sandstorm requires players to communicate and coordinate effectively to succeed. Each match demands careful planning and precise execution, whether you’re capturing objectives, defending positions, or escorting valuable assets. The game’s various modes, including Push, Firefight, and Checkpoint, offer diverse challenges that test different aspects of tactical proficiency.Visually, Insurgency: Sandstorm may not boast the cutting-edge graphics of some AAA titles, but it compensates with meticulously designed maps that offer a variety of environments, from dense urban centers to sprawling rural landscapes. These maps are not only visually distinct but also intricately designed to support a wide range of tactical approaches.However, Insurgency: Sandstorm is not without its flaws. New players may find the steep learning curve daunting, as the game does little to hold your hand. The realism that hardcore fans love can be a barrier to entry for those accustomed to more forgiving shooters. Additionally, while the game has seen numerous updates and content additions, it still suffers from occasional bugs and performance issues that can detract from the overall experience.Despite these drawbacks, Insurgency: Sandstorm offers a refreshing alternative to more mainstream shooters. Its emphasis on realism and tactical gameplay creates a uniquely intense experience that stands out in the genre. For players who crave a challenging and authentic depiction of modern combat, Insurgency: Sandstorm is a compelling choice that rewards patience, precision, and teamwork.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 7, 2024",8,Metacritic

It’s a stuttering, Tearing un optimized mess on day one, a new developer I would give a by ball but this is a 3 year old game and it looks and runs like a PS2 game with the graphics of MGS 1. Lets run down the list of issues this scummy developer thought they would get away with: No Hit Detector, No Kill Detector, A weird marker for friendly’s that appears to the side of them and at some distance from them, a broken comms system where enemy conversations can be heard, screen tearing, lack of any anti-aliasing, Lack of HD graphics, this things running in standard def, lack of textures, broken load out system that fails to remember saved load outs, Lack of progress markers, lack of round information, lack of scoring system, an extremely low draw distance, a gutted game mode system, no vehicles, pop in everywhere, lack of 60fps (in an FPS of all things) a mess of a menu system, a diabolical weapon modification system that remembers nothing, a class system that’s all over the place with standard sniper, heavy, light and assault classes all behind paywalls. And the most important part the bullet physics, I understand the game is built around this but with the exceptionally low graphics there is simply no point to it, I cannot see the drop to correct the shot through the tearing and jaggy choppy gameplay.

Insurgency Sandstorm,412020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,facknrite,"Sooooooooooo after waiting 6 months waiting for an update and optimization for the game, DEV's launched 1.6 test version which includes 1 mediocre map and 2 new guns that have an excesive stupid recoil and added it to the advisor class removing the SVD and EBR MK14 that were the most used guns by players on that class.

They also added the most stupid feature called DEATHCAM which is total trash because now you can see from where you got shot from and all the enemies on that area, meaning that the tactical part of the game is lost.

Once again after hundreds of complaints about that stupid feature they are still going to implement it on the stable version which demonstrate that they don't give a **** about their community feedback and they will still do whatever they want.

So my question is...what is the point of asking feedback when DEV's really don't care about your opinion unless you kiss their a$$es with every stupid decision they make.

Just to make a quick summary of what you will be getting by buying this game is:

- 0 optimization (optimization for this DEV's means, removing stuff from the maps)
- Updates every 6 months which are just gonna be trash.
- Hit Reg issues
- Abandoned Server Owners (Meaning no new cvars, no server side optimization)
- Terrible Hit Reg
- Unknown Performance(The game can run amazingly well on a top tier PC ro it can run like trash on the same PC)
- Fed Up Community (Tired of all the **** of the game and DEV's that got stucked with a facked up game without the option to refund it)

So if you are willing to go through all of that then buy it, if not then save your money and wait for some amazing titles being launched this year.

Risk of Rain 2,632360,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nazrielau05,"I blew 10 hours into Risk of Rain 2. I couldn't get past through Mithrix **** this playthrough made me appreciate this game a whole lot more.

I was never too impressed with the game's presentation. I think i just needed more time to get comfortable with the game's general direction. It's not the most visually interesting game I've played, but at least the character design, enemy designs, level design, and colour grading all comes together to deliver a solid package of a visual style. I want to emphasis on the enemy designs here. Their designs are what sold me to the game's visual direction. The larger creatures has a certain aesthetic to them that compliments the background setting a lot.

I was also mixed on the music for a good while. I don't dislike them or anything, but i think i got very overwhelmed by the game's stimuli. The default settings for this game's audio was really loud and it made me uncomfortable. It's not until i turned down the volume until i could appreciate the game's audio design. The soundtrack elevates the hectic and chaotic battle sequences at least 10 times. Of course, this is only possible if the sound effects were good in the first place, and they are! the sound designs has so much weight to it. It really sells you the scale of the larger enemies in the game. Sound clues are also very effective here. A lot of sounds are exclusive to a certain type of threat. So a headphone/earphone is recommended to get the full experience.

This game's mechanics is the spotlight here. Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D Third person shooter game, and it uses that concept until the point of exhaustion. It's a philosophy that's very integral for any type of Art. You thought of a concept? use it over and over again until you couldn't think of anything more. Some of the most memorable enemies for me are the airborn ones! That's a serious feat in my opinion. And some of the on-ground enemies could jump/float! just to mess with your sense of vision. This game's battle sequences are extremely hectic and chaotic. This experience is probably what made me uncomfortable about the game for a good while. So many things could happen in a blink of an eye! the stimuli is insane.

Another thing about RoR 2's mechanics I've seen being brought up by the community is the Rogue-like implementation. Other Rogue-like video games won't allow you to have too many abilities in a single run, just because they don't want you to be too powerful. Like Hades, Inscryption, and Buckshot Roulette, just to name a few. Risk of Rain 2 is perfectly fine with you stacking up so many insane power ups on top of the external helps (Drones, Turrets, Guardians etc.). RoR 2 allows the player to feel like an absolute monster. How did the game balance this mechanic? The final boss could steal your items and abilities. You get them back by dealing damage at the bastard. Insane video game. The game's battle system oozes so much polish and care behind it. I couldn't help but feel inclined to boot up RoR 2 day after day just to experience it again. Risk of Rain 2 is a very fresh experience in the Rogue-like space. Not necessarily the absolute king of the genre, but a unique exprience nonetheless.

Las razones hablaré de ellas ahora, pero quiero que quede claro que lo jugué en solitario, con lo que probablemente las sensaciones y eso para quienes lo jueguen en multiplayer con amigos (como está diseñado) sean mejores. Si resumimos mucho, el juego es un shooter rogue-like, con mogollón de enemigos, cada vez más y más duros, en lo que explorar zonas para conseguir mejoras aleatorias y desbloquear el teleportador previa batalla contra el boss. El problema es que se hace muy repetitivo porque le faltan cosas típicas de los roguelike. Una de esas cosas es que los mapas aquí son fijos (con variaciones menores como zonas pequeñas que pueden estar accesibles o no), con lo cual se acaba conociendo los mismos demasiado, si además tenemos en cuenta que los primeros los ves todo el rato, se acaba haciendo muy repetitivo. Luego le falta una historia así como un sistema de progresión de cualquier clase que otorgue objetivos o razones para jugar, pero en este caso cada intento es completamente independiente. El único cambio que queda de una partida a otra es lo que vas desbloqueando, que se hace en base a conseguir logros, algunos de los cuales ocurrirán simplemente por ir jugando, pero la mayoría acaban dependiendo del azar de que te caigan los bonos adecuados, de que una habilidad ocurra de cierto modo, etc. lo cual acaba siendo muy frustrante. Igual que lo es el hecho de que, llegado cierto punto y con una build decente, al final el juego se resume en ""te vas cargando todo sin que te hagan nada hasta que llegas al lugar equivocado y sin que puedas evitarlo, de una hostia te bajan entero"". Gráficamente el juego tiene una estética muy suya pero personalmente no me ha gustado nada,  y tiene además ciertos problemas de legibilidad en la distancia (como que los cadáveres de ciertos enemigos parecen cofres). La música ahí ya es cosa de gustos, para mi es demasiado electrónica noventera, que es un género que no me convence, pero ahí habrá a quien si le parezca perfecta y sin duda, no puedo decir que sea mala pese a que no encaje en mis gustos. No hay voces como tales, los efectos de sonido son muy básicos. Y el juego tiene ciertos bugs ocasionales como cosas que spawnean dentro de paredes, una baja IA de enemigos y aliados, **** todo ello, Risk of Rain no me parece un juego terrible, pero tampoco gran cosa.

Pros: Intense atmosphere - Realistic gunplay - Teamwork is crucialCons: Steep learning curve - Outdated visuals - Not newbie-friendly Rising Storm 2: Vietnam stands out among war games with its emphasis on realism and tactical depth. It’s not the most accessible title, but once mastered, it offers a deeply satisfying and immersive experience. The game captures the chaos of the Vietnam War with great authenticity—from the crack of gunfire to the intensity of large-scale firefights. Teamwork is absolutely crucial, as success depends more on coordination than individual skill. While its dated visuals and steep difficulty may deter newcomers, players who enjoy a strategic and

It's tough and will kick your ass, but it's such a blast to play. It's not perfect. The game never feels ""stable,"" and stuff like ping is constantly all over the place across the board. But it doesn't really detract from the experience too much.  It's really a good time.

There are some aspects that aren't ideal. The community is pretty toxic at times, but it's not something that plagues the entire player base. There are also a lot of classes where you will not be able to play 99% of the time.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cthulhu5000,"This review is based on experience playing RS2:V after EGA giveaway. If you grab game for free this might help you decide is it worth actually downloading.

It's my first realistic MMOFPS, I enjoyed it so much at first, I'd made a little research through guides and game history, and now ready to present my opinion.

IF IT WAS 2017, I'D RATE GAME 8 OR 9 OUT OF 10. BUT THERE ARE TO MANY ""BUTS"" NOW. As you could've guessed, FOR SHORT VERSION READ ONLY CAPS from now on.

GAME IS BASICALLY ABANDONED BY DEVELOPERS. That's it. It was free giveaway because company no longer interested in the game. Original developer team is long gone and had to be recontacted to do EGS-transfer and troubleshooting.
There is stuff just cut out from the game. It's three maps and M16A2. Game realistically doesn't have over 9000 guns, so it's really important. There are some balancing issues never to be resolved (Long Tan map for example). No event support at all (like Halloween). Graphics are just bad. No bulletholes on surfaces, you can't zero your gun properly while training. No internal guides, just two training areas, one of which being actual map, no ability to train with bots there. There are nasty bugs, I'd seen on 2017 videos and even 2015 CBT footages. Going prone and standing up can result in your legs being under the ground and you will limp excessively. In this condition, moving prone is the fastest way. If your helicopter crashed, you survived and some ally is near by, it mostly results in autokick from server for excessive team damage. There are of course some smaller bugs, but these two are the biggest pain.

CONTENT CREATORS ARE GONE. Basically no channels. Old guides with obsolete information. Placeholders, work-in-proogress, no longer supported everywhere.

PING IS HELL. Don't believe ping value of server in search. Multiply by at least 3, be ready for x4, expect x5. And magically 20 ping becomes 100. Sometimes, when we're losing, I check ping values of players. Losing team has higher values.

TO GET FULL GAME PAY EXTRA ~50$ MONTHLY. There are 2 types of servers. Official and private. Private costs money. You can't just create a room with setting, no-no, pay to third party. Official servers have some of only two game modes: Territory (capture the objective) and Supremacy (capture and hold for points). If you want to play Skirmish (team deathmatch), Campaign (consequent battles with its own rules) or Green Army Man DLC as Free Grunt (Territory and Supremacy) you have two options: go for someone's server hope for the best (ping, rules, community, quantity of players) or buy one for yourself and hope for the same best. Same applies for different settings (called mutators), like visibility of allied troops marks, making game more realistic.

GAMING COMMUNITY ****.
You get new players, that don't want to learn, grab most important classes, and try to play RS2V as generic MMOFPS, aiming for good K/D ratio, that they will never get, and not playing the objective.
On the other hand you have salty people that send anyone to training areas to learn to fly, for example. Well, it's really easy with 0 ms ping and when no one is firing at you.
Again, on some other hand you have kickers. They want your class just because. Or don't like you. Most notorious one changed team and kicked me. Why others agreed? I suppose, they thought ""if votekick is going, it's definitely for a reason"". So, I ask you, if you'll play, never votekick if you don't know the crime.
Just bad commanders.
Radiomen not sticking to commander and actually picking up this class just because it's a class. They don't even use the smokes.

Combat, gameplay, pace, maps, guns, sound, and Community are awsome.

Servers, Graphics, and animation ****!

Gameplay-
Its just divine, you feel like you are really in the war, and you can't just run for the objective, you need to be careful, cooperate with your teammates.
The shots feel real, and every decision you make will have an impact (good or bad).
The community always tries to help and is respectful.

Now the bad points:

Graphics and animations-
They look kinda bad and outdated, even for a 2017 game, I mean, its unreal engine 3 and there are a lot of visual bugs.

Servers-
Now, this is THE big problem:
The worst servers I've seen in my entire life (including MW)... The game is free right now, and 20k people are playing the game, but it cant handle such amount of people! my question is: if they cant handle 20k players, why is it free? I mean, it is just a dumb move, and no one will want to return to the game, and it will die AGAIN...
I can't find servers and the servers that are not full have 200 ping.

Although it is a banal shooting range for speed,
But, the music makes this experience unforgettable and infinitely replayable, I respect the composer, this ""inducing"" motive, which, after passing the middle of the game, becomes generally mad - it's incredible.
The plot here, most likely, is about a drug addict who is trying not to die and get out of the ""binge"", and, of course, there is not enough full-fledged story up to 10/10, but you can imagine any story convenient for you in your head, where the main character needs to run until the end and not die. Another flaw of the game for me is not very well-developed shooting, I completed game with a shotgun, it's much easier, but the ""aim-challenge"" is losted.
Well, I can also say that sometimes quite beautiful locations are generated, all the sounds are of high quality.
And yet, the game is quite easy, in fact, it takes 4-7 hours to complete, even if you don’t know how to shoot (again, shotgun helps you), lacks some kind of hardcore mode, but it would be even better to get the second part)

Это игра - настоящее произведение искусства!
Хоть и представляет из себя банальный тир на скорость,
Но, музыка делает этот экспериенс незабываемым и бесконечно реиграбельным, композитору моё почтение, вот этот ""нагнетающий"" мотив, который после прохождения середины игры становится вообще бешенным - это невероятно.
Сюжет тут, скорее всего, про наркомана, который пытается не умереть и выбраться из ""запоя"", и, полноценной истории до 10/10, конечно, не хватает, но вы можете представлять в голове любую удобную вам историю, где главному герою надо добежать до конца и не умереть. Ещё один недостаток игры для меня в не очень проработанной стрельбе, я проходил только с дробашом, так гораздо легче, но ""аим-челлендж"" теряется.
Ну а так, ещё могу сказать, что иногда генерируются довольно красивые локации, все звуки качественные.

Might just be an example of too much being a bad thing, but by the time I hit ep3 I was kinda over it.

I have played so many shooters from huge AAA titles to AA to indies and truly very few can come even close to how this game is managing to capture the old school boomer shooter aesthetic while at the same time looking super modern and have amazing graphics.

The ammo and health distribution is also an issue, there is no reliable way to get these from the enemies, unless they are fodder enemies.

My main complaint is that some weapons are objectively much better than others, so as things get harder you pretty quickly get forced into using the same couple of weapons while ignoring the rest. The games of this genre that I've enjoyed the most have revolved around switching between well-balanced weapons to take advantage of their various strengths, but that aspect just isn't here.

If you feel like you might like it from the trailer you will most definitely love it, it's pretty straight forward. 

I had to cut one point because there are parts of the game that didn't click for me. Sometimes I got lost in the level and wasn't sure how to progress, but not for long fortunately. The flipping mechanic is very confusing with the perspective change on the camera. There were also certain spots where the enemies would get stuck, but not too many.

Dusk,1100600,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Zski,"This is a game that has to be played to understand why the reviews are so high. I watched videos and thought it looked neat, but it wasn’t really pulling me in. It sat in my library for over a year, and within 5 minutes of experiencing it, I understood. A couple days later, I finished the game, and what a wonderful treat for people who grew up with the original Quake. This game seriously captures the same energy of Quake without making the formula feel in any way dated. The gameplay is very simple, but it’s a nice refreshing throwback to when games required the fast paced run and gun movement rather than relying on cover. Where I think the game really shines is the atmosphere - who would have ever thought that this game with its intentionally retro graphics and play style would have a creepier atmosphere than many modern horror games. The initial part of the game gave me the atmospheric feeling of Resident Evil 4, except better. Some of the later sections of the game are truly unsettling. Between the beautiful yet extremely simple graphics and the phenomenal sound design, it helps tell the story of the game without the game actually having much of an overt story at all. Everything is told through the atmosphere and level design. It was actually pretty fun guessing what was going on and trying to create a story for yourself, since there is hardly any written or spoken dialogue. The sound design in this game is fantastic, a master in its class and it outsides most major modern horror games - especially some of the settings in the later portions of the game. It’s a pretty challenging game, but its highly rewarding. While it got frustrating at times, the satisfaction of pushing through a level and completing it after multiple tries was something I rarely experience in games anymore. The only flaw I would say is regarding some of the level design, which is true to the classic genre, but it didn’t age the best. I found myself lost pretty regularly because a lot of the textures and buildings look the same. Sometimes it allowed for some fun exploration, other times I was just running around for several minutes unable to figure out where I last saw something. There are a few really dark levels that were particularly irritating because of how difficult it was to find your way around. Overall, this is an excellent game that I think fans of the classics and modern shooter fans can both enjoy all the same. Everything this game sets out to do it excels at.",True,N/A,N/A,"Aug 17, 2023",9,Metacritic

Anger Foot,2198510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,CrackDiet,"Overall a very fun, unique and interesting experience. The world of S#*t city is pungent, and fits exceptionally well with its art style (both in game and within the intro cutscene and accompanying art), atmosphere, tone and, best of all, the soundtrack. 
Gameplay is engaging. As you progress and complete challenges within missions, you acquire a new pair of trainers which give you modifiers which range from a second life, explosions when you kick doors, giving enemies big heads, etc. It bodes well for replayability. The game at its core isn’t so challenging, but when going for the challenge stars, it makes the game a lot more difficult. 

The thing I like the most about this game is the artstyle, music, atmosphere and setting, I think it all fits together exceptionally well, and gives a breath of fresh air to the genre. A unique experience, and something that will stay in my mind for a while.

Anger Foot,2198510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,CthlhuCory,This game reminds me a lot of the Ghostrunner series where it's definitely a first person shooter/melee game but it's less about just shooting your way through levels and more about being precise. Feels more like a puzzle game to an extent than just a straightforward shooter. Definitely a game where it's all about trial and error and you will absolutely have to play a level multiple times to get your run down perfect. A little frustrating because of this and because it feels like a grind and I constantly feel like even if I am doing well I could get killed going through a new doorway and have to restart the whole level all over again. The music is great and it is kind of a ridiculous concept of the world run by gangs and you being the one guy who's not in a gang. Gameplay is super solid though which is bringing me back into it for sure. The random driving mechanics they threw in to the last two levels of the game totally threw me off and they were not intuitively controlled at all and that dropped the score for me because a solid shooter became a janky Drive Fest in the very last stretch of the game.,True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 5, 2025",7,Metacritic

Better movement, gameplay and control that most of the Doom/Quake-like out there. 
The music its great, like in Hotline, without the music this game wouldn`t be half of what it is.
Good art style, coherent with its setting and story. 
Can replay the levels multiples times to get all stars and not feel discouraged in failure. However, once completed in full, there`s nothing that makes you try again. What`s the problem about this? The game is short already, and the full levels don`t add much time of play to the pool.

SUPERHOT,322500,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Frozya,"Superhot — это необычный шутер, который выделяется своим уникальным игровым процессом. Идея того, что время движется только тогда, когда двигаешься ты, заставляет продумывать каждый шаг и делает игру похожей на своеобразную стратегию в реальном времени. Атмосфера минимализма и яркий визуальный стиль тоже играют свою роль: красные враги на фоне белого окружения смотрятся стильно и придают всему происходящему особый шарм.Но, несмотря на оригинальность, есть моменты, которые могут надоесть. Кампания довольно короткая, а после прохождения основного сюжета остается не так много причин возвращаться. Кроме того, сама концепция замедления времени интересна, но в какой-то момент она перестает быть чем-то необычным и превращается в рутину.В итоге Superhot — это отличная игра для пары вечеров, но ее идеи не раскрываются в полной мере.

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Highwayy,"Legends of Runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. Most importantly, LoR innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like Hearthstone). With most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. The artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like League of Legends and Arcane. The game offers an incredible and near-endless PvE experience in addition to PvP: in fact, PvP has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. The future is difficult to predict and I hope that PvP will grow more as my heart will always be in PvP gameplay. Perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for PvP.

Depending on your starting hand, and how you play it, will the computer ""choose"" the cards you pick up in your deck, I find in most cases. So at that point, it's only strategic for like, the first 25% of the round, and the next 5 - 7 mins is just the computer stalling to make the game longer, REGARDLESS of whether you are winning or losing. I felt this isn't an ACTUAL card game because you don't get your cards by chance, but the cards you pick up are heavily influenced by the (winning/losing) stance you are in (Losing = **** cards each round, winning = Stronger cards each round), The probability of getting certain cards is sealed depending on whether you are winning or losing, unlike REAL card games, the chance of getting any card is always 1 / Total number of cards.",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 22, 2025",7,Metacritic

Today I played lor, I played LAB mode. A mode that fights with Ai with characters like Yasuo Jinx Jayce to choose from. I have played Yasuo until Victor. Before reaching the Viktor stage, I had to pass a level where it was random, every turret Round start.
I'm going to tell you that **** is so unbalanced I'm stuck at level 3 4 times and still haven't passed.
I think what
1. Unbalanced is a card that Ai randomly gets and still gets a Key word. Key word is this. It pisses me off a lot. I randomly hit through and the one that hit through is a T-Rex 8/8.
2. The card I have The gad I randomly picked up some important characters.
2.1 Cleared the whole board (this one I'm okay with) but what's not okay is when the main character is dead What character? to defeat the T-rex 8/8 Overwhelm.

2.2 Random Gards Gards that can make me play easier won't say. For example, if I do a Yasuo + Yone combo, these gards won't come out.

End. I'm dizzy. I'm totally out of mood playing this LAB. I wasted 1 to 2 hours.

F2P friendly, nice Graphics/Artwork and regual new content makes it fun for a game now and then.

The biggest let down for me are Bugs, Metaplay and communication.
Bugs appear on a dayli base and range from grafics glitches into others to cards wont work or you cant place them (even though i encountered gamebreaking bugs very rarely).
Bugs stay in the game for very long until they get fixed e.g. Shurima came out 8 Months ago and Azirs voice lane is still cut during the lvl up animation.

Communication means, i have the feeling they only hear positiv feedback and ignore negativ feedback/player suggestions, one reason i post my critic here.
Imo the Report Side is not comfortable (i was not able to use it for a long time) and i dont like the big chatroom on discord, i feel ignored.

There are a lot builds you can play but only for the Memes, not for winning. In ranked, you can see only flavor of the month, the Metagame is very strong in this one.
Off-Meta builds are really not fun to play and the few Meta Builds change on every patch.
Power Creep is a huge problem in LoR, every patch, the new Cards are way more powerfull then the ""older ones"", either by having way better Stats/cost ratio or have the same stats but really good keywords.
The game makes no secret that it has its focus on fast games, thats why rush decks are Meta and lategame or control decks feel useless. E.g. Seamonsters needs you to throw 25 of your 40 cards away ,literally(!), to have theyr keyword work.
The only reason i do sometimes recommend it to some die hard League fans is its because its F2P.

Clair Obscur Expedition 33,1903340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Tarquin,"Bought this game with the expectations of getting the masterpiece, the best game ever made, the true ultimate legend ****. Instead I got huuuge disappointment and wasted dozens of euros. I got a game with falsely described genre, a game with shallow characters, a game which is now a new king of running simulators, as there is literally nothing else to do, you just run, and then you fight, and then run again, and fight, and run, and fight, .... I was told it was great turn-based game with real-time mechanics, instead I got QTE game, but with control over up to 3 characters (so I did QTE in turns for them). Combat is also extremely unbalanced, as literally just parrying can win every single fight in this game, while missing a dodge or parry in later stages of the game means instant fail, team death and reset from last save. This is tied to abilities and perk-buy management. There are multiple distinct abilities (at least the text is different), however because of the lack of game balance I mentioned previously, it actually does not matter what abilities does player pick, as dodging or parrying perfectly is the only singular requirement to win every single fight in the entire game without any exceptions. Adding to that, this results in excesive repetitivness of gameplay. Next up, I was expecting bit of a roleplaying (that is this ""RP"" in RPG), but I got no dialogues at all while playing the game (except for the camp, there I was able to read few lines of dialogues, and except for cutscenes, obviously). Many praised this game for story, but somehow I got another cheap premise with rushed second half of the story. The idea was good though, just the execution was simply bad. Nonchalant ""cute"" cutscenes did not fit the narrative and were breaking the ""immersion"" for me, although immersion is veeeery strong word to use here, as this game does not deliver immersion of any kind. The same goes for OST, which was quite good, however some anime-like combat bangers absolutely did not fit the atmosphere at all. Last but not least I will mention the visuals, which are as good as in any UE5 game, so nothing special there, but nothing to complain about either, except for two things - 1) developers tried to make every environment special, unique and distinct, but the result is quite the opposite as all the locations feel simmilar in every way except for colours used in them; and 2) glitches were EVERYWHERE.

In conclusion, the hype around this game is as artificial as it gets, driven by ""30 devs"" story, which is also not true. This game has nothing much to offer for people with some standards. If you like empty corridors, endless running and QTE, this is a game for you. Objectively, if this was not advertised as ""game of the generation"" I would give this game like 4/10, however, I expected 100x more from advertised ""masterpiece"" and ended up deeply disappinted, like I probably never was before.",False,N/A,N/A,"Nov 10, 2025",1,Metacritic

Disco Elysium,632470,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,razzzor,"Are all the critics on a rush of putting anything intellectual and different as game of the year? I just got done playing Journey (late on the PC) and was just as puzzled as to how that was game of the year.This is standard point-and-click adventure gaming, absolutely nothing ground-breaking apart from just good writing. If you like that sort of thing and love reading books of that style, you'll enjoy it I suppose.

The only difference is it's much longer than your standard adventure game, more depth in the skills and the dialogue just goes on and on. Half a million lines they say? Do I really want to read all that? Much of it is just pointless dribble. You have all these inside voices that speak, but it's not really that interesting. The most interesting dialogue in the whole game was the humour from the two kids near the start and the ringing the police station.

The art/design is all beautiful. But it's still stuck in an overhead isometric camera view. For sure if they had a AAA budget they would do a third-person mouse look, that's far more immersive. Can you imagine watching a movie, or even a 20 hour TV series, where its just this one view above their heads? It would be laughed at. But somehow, 40 years since the start of the isometric point and click, we're still stuck on this low budget camera angle. You never see the characters faces. Even in the small picture frame you get of the characters, which often barely resemble the model on-screen, it's just a static picture. The main character never even has a voice, and your sidekick is deadpan in everything he says. This is lacking in any expression or emotion. When you only have the budget to do a single isometic angle, this simply can't be a 9+/10. You'll also have to fight through sluggish movement, constantly bumping into invisible walls absolutely everywhere trying to work out the small path to walk. I even had a few game ending bugs that I had to reload from.

The overall gameplay revolves around slowly walking back and forth for hours clicking things until something happens in the game, because it's often unclear what you're supposed to do so you just have to click everything, exhaust every dialogue tree, until one of the many missions you have resolves something so you can continue. You'll get a dialogue dead-end where you don't have the skills or research necessary to continue, so you do random tasks to unlock it, or reload the game over and over until you pass the check my chance. I also didn't load a lot into the skills because it's so unclear what's really going to help, as well as how many skill points you have. So I just left it until the end game to when I thought I would need them, but I still didn't. I'd probably only used 5 skills points throughout the game.

The skill sets and requiring certain skills, items and tasks to be completed to unlock dialogue is still a nice idea overall and I'm not sure how you could tweak it to make it better. But a 9/10, nope.

What was good about most of the game was the story, which had me continuing to play it to see how in unravelled. But in the end, without spoilers, the conclusion really had absolutely nothing to do with anything up till that point and just felt like the writer didn't have any idea how to finish it so just threw something in there to wrap things up. A major disappointment.

This is a nice simple point and click adventure, but it goes on for far too long. Over 20 hours I spent on it and was ready for it to be over before then. The highlights for me are just seeing a nice new area of the map. It's not the mountains of dialogue, the story that was never properly concluded, or the very basic puzzle solving. But I can see much better looking design in a full 3D game and countless adventure games already look this beautiful.

I'd give it a 7/10. I think the critics have just forgotten what normal adventure games are like and got all hung  up on intellectual dialogue and skill trees.",True,N/A,N/A,"May 1, 2025",7,Metacritic

Disco Elysium,632470,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,PenetratorGod,"I played the game and it was definitely one of the worst and boring games I've ever seen and I deleted it. It's not a game, it's more like an e-book.

First of all, this is not an open world game. I have no idea how it can be marketed like this, have the makers ever seen an open world game? The NPCs do nothing but sleep at night and the world is a small and frankly empty map. It's static and dead and never changes. It's not even a world, let alone an open world.

It's not a real RPG either. Yes, you have stats and inventory and dice rolls, but that's it. Also, these are just game mechanics, there's a skill tree and inventory like in a lot of games, but they don't make a game an RPG game, and there's no real choice, because the whole difference is tied to dialog options, which you'll click on anyway, further destroying the role-playing part, and for a lot of things, choosing to do something will actually be a dice roll, and the mechanics of retrying the roll are overly complicated and too overwhelming to take the time.

No matter what you do, you'll be dragged towards a single ending, which makes sense since it's a murder mystery, but as a player you have no choice, the only real choice is at the character creation screen, and from that point on it's pretty much set how you're going to play the next 30-40 hours of the game, which is filled with dialog just to drag it out.

Yes, you can click on options in dialog windows, but the game will decide for you whether that happens or not, and it will mostly depend on your character's stats and some modifiers. Yes, again, it's an RPG mechanic, but as a player, you don't really get to choose anything or do anything.

An example **** where your choices really matter would be Detroit Become Human. Or even Witcher 3. Disco Elysium is nowhere near that level, Detroit is already not an RPG game, Witcher 3 is not a pure RPG, but supposedly Disco Elysium was marketed as open world and a pure RPG, but it's not even half as successful as those games.

In short, Disco Elysium is not a game to be played even if it's free. I never understood what they liked about this game. It is one of the most overrated games of recent years.",False,N/A,N/A,"Sep 1, 2023",4,Metacritic

Sea of Stars,1449850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Kai82,One on hand an incredibly good old school turn based RPG and on the other they use a lot of design choices I dislike. It is inspired by old RPGs like Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross. You can play as Valere or Zale who are Solstice Warriors. If you are born on summer or winter solstice you are special and can unlock sun or moon magic. Back in the past an evil alchemist named the Fleshmancer developed near godlike powers and nearly destroyed the world. His creations the Dwellers still exist and are only vulnerable on Eclipses to sun and moon magic. The story starts with Zale and Valeres training to become Solstice warriors and evolves to a fight to the fate of the world. The story and characters are superb. I felt the emotions and impacts the character face. I struggled with them and it was an intense feeling. The story evolves and has many surprises and turns. I think it is some of the best stuff in years. The gameplay is a bit mixed. I feel bad for mentioning it as it could just be not my taste. The turn base battles have a gimmick. Special attacks by the enemies can be nullified. Locks are displayed when an enemy cast a special attack. For example a moon and sword symbol. If you attack with a moon and sword attack (or both) before the counter reaches zero the attack is nullified. Normal attacks create mana orbs which can be used to power up your actions. Each character has his/her unique elements and used mana orbs are converted to their mana types.  Now to the choices I dislike. Your level ups are rare and give not much stat wise. You are give a choice to boost some stats on each level up but that makes not much difference. At the time I was in the final dungeon I was just on level 23 with a lot of grinding. They also don't want you to power level. The experience points from battle decrease on each level up. Also the true ending requires a lot of effort that feels like a chore. Here I had a bug that prevents me from getting it. Luckily there is YouTube. Finally the resource management is a bit of a chore too. You can switch to auto heal after each battle which gives a total different gaming experience. If not you have a boring cycle of collecting food and cooking to replenish health. Sadly you have a very limited storage for cooked items. The Wheels mini game is really nice and I enjoyed it. The presentation is superb. The graphics look really great and the soundtrack is memorable. Overall I ended up enjoying the game even with its flaws.

Crusader Kings III,1158310,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,nbdiden,"Crusader Kings III remains the crown jewel of character-driven grand strategy: a sprawling medieval soap opera where secrets, stress, hooks, and schemes make people—not provinces—the real battlefield. Five years on, a steady cadence of expansions and free patches has turned a strong launch into a remarkably rich sandbox. Royal Court introduced artifacts, court grandeur, and a deep culture rework with traditions and hybridization. Tours & Tournaments overhauled activities and travel so your ruler actually roams the map to host tournaments, weddings, and realm tours that blend story and statecraft. Legends of the Dead added prestige-building legends and frightening, map-wide epidemics that finally put mid-to-late-game comfort at risk. Roads to Power revitalized the Byzantine experience, layered in administrative government and family estates, and even let you play as a landless adventurer. 2025’s Khans of the Steppe brought a sharper nomadic identity and seasonal pressures to the steppes, while the small Coronations pack turns being crowned into a dramatic, choice-filled ceremony. With All Under Heaven on the horizon expanding the map into East Asia, CK3 continues to widen its **** result is a game that excels as a story engine first and a map painter second. Cultures feel alive rather than static tech trees, court identity gives you long-term goals, and activities pull you out of menus and into your realm’s politics. New playstyles—from imperial intrigue to nomadic ambition—keep campaigns fresh, and the mod scene supercharges longevity with total conversions and quality-of-life tools. That said, warfare and economy remain intentionally broad-brush, which may disappoint players chasing crunchy tactical depth or intricate economic loops. Very large realms can still snowball into stability unless you lean on game rules or self-imposed challenges, and each big chapter tends to arrive with balance bumps that need hotfixes. The DLC web is real, too: while major patches are generous, the “full modern CK3” experience is spread across multiple add-ons. On platforms, PC is definitive thanks to mods, but the PS5 and Xbox versions have matured into genuinely comfortable ways to play, even without mod support.Verdict: Crusader Kings III is still the most entertaining medieval drama generator you can buy. With its expanding cast of systems and consistently surprising emergent narratives, it turns dynastic pettiness into grand history better than anything else out there. Expect occasional rough edges and a growing DLC bill, but the core magic remains unmatched. Score: 9/10.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 4, 2025",9,Metacritic

Crusader Kings III,1158310,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,S1mon3,"Crusader Kings III is a deep and engaging grand strategy title that can keep you hooked for hours, thanks to its rich dynastic, political, and narrative mechanics. Managing your house, navigating tricky diplomatic decisions, and reacting to emergent story events make for an extremely immersive medieval experience for fans of the genre.However, a significant drawback is the absence of an official Italian localization. The volume of text is huge—beyond menus and mechanical descriptions, there are intrigues, legends, dynastic stories, and historical details that deserve to be read calmly and thoroughly. For many non-English speakers, this represents a real barrier that can discourage newcomers or prevent them from catching every narrative and gameplay **** Italian community has stepped in with fan-made translation mods on Steam Workshop or Paradox Mods—often updated with care and covering a very high percentage of strings. These “do-it-yourself” solutions greatly improve accessibility but have two main limits: they require manual updates after each patch or DLC, and even when done well, occasional translation inconsistencies or unlocalized strings can slip through, disrupting the **** a text-heavy, narrative-rich game like this, an official translation would ensure consistency and completeness, avoiding the frustration of missing strings or mod incompatibilities. It would also signal that Paradox Interactive values the Italian market, helping grow the player base by making the game more approachable for those less comfortable in English or who simply prefer playing in their native language.Setting aside this issue, the gameplay itself remains outstanding: the interface is polished, the tutorial helps you start but mastering the complex mechanics still takes time, and multiplayer offers compelling challenges with friends. The historical depth and freedom to craft unique stories make Crusader Kings III one of the best titles in its genre, despite the steep learning **** summary, I give it 8/10 because at its core the game is excellent and deeply satisfying for grand strategy enthusiasts, but the lack of an official Italian localization significantly reduces accessibility for many players. Fan translations are a great resource, but they can’t replace a professional localization effort: if Paradox released official Italian support, I would raise this score.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 17, 2025",8,Metacritic

* Too much focus on RPG part of the game (frequent random events that get repetitive/annoying very quickly) instead of the mechanics. Many parts of the game could use new/deeper mechanics (HRE, papacy, crusades, diplomacy, republics etc.). Unfortunately the DLC seems to focus on even more RPG events instead of core game mechanics.

* Game too easy overall. Limitless aggressive expansion is possible. Intrigue is too powerful.

* Bad UI, even by Paradox standards. The new map lacks many important viewmodes that were essential in CK2, and requires you to zoom in/out constantly to finally fade in the content you need (armies, counties etc. - but at the same time you get useless terrain features, snow effects etc.).

Система сохранений - сохраняет когда ей вздумается. Баланс классов просто отсутствует - вор и лучник бесполезны чуть больше чем полностью. Ахуеть, вместо того, что бы получать радость от игры у меня постоянно было чувство страдания. Походу целью разработчиков была проверка игроков на прочность. Система таргетинга откровенно хуевая - время от времени то и дело, что получаются миссклики. Вместо того что бы ударить - персонаж начинает пиздовать кудато, что невыносимо выводит из себя.

Let me tell you something kids, as a hardcore RPG veteran with decades of experience: Just because you are starved for a new RPG, doesn't mean that every piece of garbage that arrives at the stores and has character stats is worth it. Back in the day, we experienced a similar RPG drought, which ended with Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, and Final Fantasy VII. See? We celebrated with real classics, not this overrated garbage.

This game is huge, but only because it is tedius. You will go pixel hunting like a mad man for no reason. It is filled with containers that have nothing inside. It has plenty of mechanics and stats to master but once you finally understand the system it lacks serious depth. The turn based combat is slow, boring, and has no reason to be turn based. The story is meh. The dialogs are cringe-worthy. Decent graphics and voice acting, and after patches is at a very good shape, but this is not enough.

It will demand a lot of time and patience from you, but it won't satisfy you. It doesn't really deliver as an RPG. Those who compare this to the classics like Baldur's gate, are out of their minds and i am fairly certain they have never played it.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Voyou,"Looking for a real RPG (as opposed to a Hack n' Slash or a platformer with skills tree), I start DOS, and immediately notice I'm in amateur territory: barely readable fonts, and no way to increase them. If you asked me 30 years ago, I would have guessed that the bigger our monitors would become, the better we could read. How it came to the exact opposite is obviously due to a conspiracy of ophthalmologists bribing game developers. Anyway, barely, but still readable, so I keep going. Instead of resting my eyes 15 minutes per hour, I'll just have to swap and actually play 15 minutes per hour.

Character creation time. A very exciting step in an RPG for sure, and usually a long one. Here, we start with a surprising surprise: we create 2 characters. Hmm... I'm a bit confused. I like talking at the singular 1st person about myself, and my avatar. That's what happens when a player feels invested in a game, and that's a plus for said game. So, will I have to use the plural, like the famous British tapeworm, Queen Victoria ? We want to be amused, and we are all for experiments, even doomed ones, so we keep going.

Characters creation was actually very quick, and very underwhelming. A few skills, some of them opening a talent pseudo-menu (pseudo because it offers actually no choices,) and we are done. Also, there are only 2 races: male and female. Err... I meant... only 2 species: bodybuilder and barbie doll. Anyway, you get our meaning. I mean, my meaning.

I both hop on a beach (confusing, isn't it ?) It's a pretty 3d world, not gorgeous like these 2d painted games, but it will do nicely. Someone is talking near the west edge, but stays invisible. These long range constant chatters will prove very annoying in the future, specially in town. They'll make you want to go away instead of doing what you plan on doing.

And then, the pixel hunting starts. Pixel hunting is the meat of this game. In the following hours, I will have hovered over, then opened, hundreds of crates and vases. Most of them empty, yet my dreadfully cumbersome inventory screen will look like a huge pile of junk. And that will be enough for me to quit and have no desire to come back. I feel like I've been playing a hack n' slash without the hack. And, mostly, pixel hunting. In 2015.

Sure, a few nice things happened in the mean time: playing mostly a thief, I discovered an amusing take on the sneaking trope, and a challenging and interesting pickpocket mechanism. I got involved in a couple of fights, and backstabbing proved satisfying at this early stage. Using magic scrolls also proved very helpful, unlike in any other game (I usually can't be bothered, but here it felt natural.) And that's about it.

It's an RPG, so there are dialogues and interactions and story lines and stuff, but one word is enough to summarise them: childish.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,asfbr,"So just finished this after 30 hours of gameplay or so.
I really liked Harry Potter as a kid, read the books since goblet of fire as they were launched, good times... 
That automatically makes us like the game, although I feel there were lots of missed opportunities here.

The main story and quest line is great. Kudos for that. The rest, however, leaves it to be an average game. 

Main issues, in my view: 
#1 Side quests, although are not repetitive per se, gave me no incentive to me for doing that (with some exceptions in the beginning for spells etc.). 
#2 That is also linked to a mediocre item mechanics. You get better items, you upgrade with same materials, breed pets, that's it. After some time it's all legendary items. Also always same price in shops. No sets, only traits for gameplay styles. Could be a lot better.
#3 Natty side quests seemed empty. Game would be better without it and I can see why people complain and even say this was a ESG filler. That does not bother me, but the character is annoying and quests are bad
#4 Alohomora mechanics is a pain in the... really whoever was the game designer responsible for this did a terrible job. Not only boring, but annoying. Also the demiguises statues. I just found myself at the end of the game with level 1 alohomora and need to spend now 1 hour I guess to get the statues to finish the rest that I was locked out. What a pain. This alone to me warrants one star less. No wonder one of the main mods is to remove this
#5 the ""mini bosses"" or ""infamous foes"" could be a lot lot better. No development around them, instant petrific totalus on them. 
== All in all, this is a great Harry Potter game. But that's it. Remove the Harry Potter world and this would be an average skippable 6 or 7 game. I had a good time playing this for the nostalgy (I guess first game since Philosopher's stone for GBA back in 2001), but I really hope devs make a better job in HL2.

The game beautifully captures the magic and wonder of the Harry Potter universe, with stunning visuals, an expansive open world, and gameplay that makes you feel like you're truly living in that world. From casting spells to exploring hidden secrets, every moment is filled with nostalgia and **** gameplay is a highlight, providing a mix of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving that keeps you engaged throughout your adventure. The world of Hogwarts Legacy is nothing short of amazing, with every corner of the castle and surrounding areas meticulously crafted to create an authentic experience.However, the game isn't without its flaws. One of the noticeable drawbacks is the boss battles. While the encounters are visually impressive, the bosses lack a certain aura of intimidation and challenge that you’d expect. They often feel underwhelming, which detracts from the overall excitement of these key moments.Additionally, while the game’s world is rich and detailed, the lore and story can feel a bit flat at times.

Story: 5/10
This game's story is average. I didn't play it for the story. Being a Harry Potter fan, I was able to endure the story.

Combat: 8/10
The combat is very good, but the difficulty in switching between spell sets and the limited number of spells are annoying.

Characters: 5/10
Almost all the characters in the game are very boring. Including our main character. The only character I really liked was Sebastian Sallow. The dialogue from all the characters is very boring.

Quests: 7/10
Except for some quests, the quests are poor and unimpressive, but they're still quite good. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you won't be bored.
Gameplay: 8/10
The gameplay is good. Simple. The switching between spell sets is annoying. Flying in the game is fine, but it would be nice if there were more things to do while flying.

Graphics: 8.5/10
The game's graphics are quite nice. The landscapes look great, but they're not 10/10.

Its been about 1-2 years since I last played, but this is my review from what main take aways I remember from playing during the first month after release. 
It had some features that were cool to have and others that just fell flat. I think the attention to detail with the world was really cool as it felt you were truly in the movies. I think the story was also really good and engaging. It also was a nice touch with how your decisions can change your ending. 
My biggest regret was buying the deluxe edition as I mainly bought it for the Thestral mount but by the time you finally unlock mounts you will already have your broomstick lvl 2 or 3 and it will be faster to use and easier to control. I also liked how we got our own customizable rooms to use but after unlocking it and customizing the room after the tutorial I never went back besides when new sections got added. The combat is ok as I like that it forces you to use a mixture of the spells but the switching between spells during combat was not the smoothest and required you to remember the layout of what you had to quickly/smoothly transition to them but is kind of hard as you are adding spells pretty regularly.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 4, 2025",7,Metacritic

Lo he abandonado porque tras tantas horas de juego, este no remonta. Si buscas un juego precioso estéticamente, pero hueco en su interior, este es ideal. Recuerdo pocos juegos como este, es como hablar con un maniquí, muy bonito de fuera, bien vestido, pero no responde ni tiene vida. Los NPC de este juego están allí para rellenar un poco el mapa, no tienen líneas de diálogo ni hacen nada más que no sea andar de un lado para otro (me refiero a fuera de Hogwarts). Lo peor del juego, es que te lleva de la mano en todo momento, todo está ""cerca"" o hay un punto de viaje rápido a 4 pasos. Las misiones no tiene ningún sentido con la trama principal, ni hacen nada para que conectes con los personajes secundarios que te las mandan. Todas son cortadas con el mismo patrón, camina, mata, vuelve, repite. Los puzles son extremadamente básicos y las secuencias de vídeo soporíferas. Debo reconocer que la primera hora y media de juego es alucinante, una maravilla, pero siento que tras ese corto período de juego, no tengo más ganas de perder tiempo con este título (SUERTE QUE NO LO COMPRÉ A PRECIO COMPLETO DE SALIDA). En lo técnico, un desastre, no puedes selecionar la resolución que mejor se adapte a tu hardware, si no que siempre va a arrancar con la resolución nativa de tu monitor (a menos que lo ejecutes en modo ventana). La utilización de los núcleos del procesador es pésima, resultando en un rendimiento inaceptable por muy buen hardware que tengas, por lo que (en mi caso) con una RTX4070 Super, podía jugarlo en medio a 1440p 60fps o ultra 30fps. Lo dicho, no puedo pedir reembolso por el tiempo de juego que es demasiado largo, ya que tenía la esperanza de que mejoraría con el tiempo. Se que es una review demasiado larga, pero espero que no te pase lo mismo que a mi, todo el mundo lo ponía por las nubes, alabando todo lo que tenía que ver con este título.

Good voice overs,  nice music

Cons

Inexcusably tedious combat
Boring
Lacking polish

Octopath Traveler would have been great on SNES or PS1 back in the late 90s but for this era it is very dated which is a shame because graphically, it has a lot of vintage charm with nice graphics and some interesting story telling that unfortunately is let down by obnoxiously slow paced combat that makes the game get exceptionally boring fast forcing the player to either not bother and move on to a faster paced game,   even by all classic snes jrpgs virtually none have the same tedious turn based combat style.

Square Enix, you know better!  Don't ever make a turn based JRPG that takes several minutes just to beat one basic monster this makes for a tedious eye rolling slog.

Octopath Traveler,1057090,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Bertucciop,"Octopath traveler, they haven't worked enough on it and ask for 60€ for it. Made on Unreal Engine for quick development I think for commercial reasons. Below I break down the different aspects of the game.

Fantastic music, sound track is the best of the game. Each character has his own music theme, maybe too melancholic but is a 10/10.

The plot is too simple and linear, cliche characters, there is no evolution in them over time. Too Manichean, evil and good well separated. A noble girl becomes a prostitute seeking for vengeance for no reason, instead of using her money and inheritance for it. Anyways narrative is ok, it is ok even if it is full of topics and empty of plot twists. It is a game for kids, not a book. Hire a Jewish screenwriter to review it before starting though, Square Enix 6/10.

Gameplay is horrible, it is a typical 90's RPG game, but dynamics are too slow.

They made a weakness point counter system which stuns and weakens enemies when they came to 0. But there are not any strategic but this in the game. In addition, they made an initiative point system, these points increase if you do not use them, and they boost your skills and attacks.

Both systems combined make combat so tedious as you have to wait turns taking enemies weaknesses points as you wait to your initiative points to increase for making massive damage.

Boss fights long the same as common fights. And skills are limited, attack, heal, low, and increase defense and attack. Enemies can blind, sleep, etc. you but it is very limited to you to do these things. You have very powerful ultimate skills at your disposal that end a combat after gaining some initiative points.

These long fights appears each two steps on map, so you can't walk at all, unless you have a mage on team who provides of an extension walking longitude before fighting. Game is hardly bearable even with this mage's skill, it is unplayable if u don't have this.

You do not need to properly manage your items, you are full of healing things and other things, you will never run out of them, even resurrection items.

There is not any puzzle on map, just walking, taking treasure chests (some are hidden by 2D vision perspective) and fighting.

The interaction of the NPCs is the 90's RPGs and they added that, depending of which character is in your team, you can steal or trade items with them, even fight a duel or investigate them, which improves skills or shows you the positions of hidden items, which is a great thing, but the plot is linear so when you get to a village you just examine, steal or trade with everyone to get new items and upgrade skills, you can also have an NPC character following you and help you in battles, you cannot control them .

You cannot make any decision, there are not dialogues which spread a list of answers, plot is linear.
3/10

Talking about graphics, all goods things and effects came from Unreal Engine basics, so they didn’t have to work so much on it, they made low quality sprites for characters, and cartoon textures for the 3D maps and a static camera angle imitating 90's RPG quality, Low-cost graphics which did not provide budget for extending other game features.2/10

Octopath Traveler,1057090,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,JanaWonderland,"This is among the most disappointing JRPGs I've ever played.

At first I was pulled in by its beautiful artstyle and more than beautiful soundtrack, but that is pretty much it. You could compare it to a disfigured and moldy pumpkin trying to hide its atrocities behind make up and plastic surgeries.

The writing is beyond horrible. Characters that almost constantly act out of character, don't make sense whatsoever and doing things that - sure keep the story going but - do not make sense whatsoever. And instead of anyone questioning their behaviour like a normal person would, everyone just takes it the way it is. Good writing shouldn't need these inconsistencies only to keep the story going, instead its characters should keep it going naturally. Other than that it was able to partake in the biggest sin of story-writing possible: Overexposition. Whatever you see on screen, the game will not hesitate to think you stupid enough not to have taken in what happened and explains it in great depths, over and over again. Then of course it also mostly deals with themes explored by many RPGs before it, making it feel even lazier and more uncreative.

If that was the only gripe I have with this game, at the very least it could be a fun little gameplay-heavy game, but the gameplay is subpar at best for that to happen. Enemies, no matter if random encounter or bosses, are the epitome of bulletsponges. Fights are far from hard, after hours of playing it not once did I die, but instead fights are stretched out like an old stepped upon bubblegum. They are merely there to artificially make the game longer. Enemies weaknesses do not make sense most of the time and unlike other, good, JRPGs are just a guessing game, which makes the fights even more atrocious. The animations, slowdowns and particle effects at least make the actual attacks feel satisfying, but if the main parts of the fighting system can't hold up, that doesn't save it either.

So the fighting system is frustratingly annoying and the story-writing is insultingly bad... What else makes a good RPG? Freedom and exploring! The game is rather free with you being able to choose from 8 different characters that have different stories from the start to fit your playstyle. However outside of battle - in which they all behave relatively same-y - they only get one ""skill"" for you to use. Things like being able to steal from people, charm them or provocate them for a fight should make the game more interesting, but they barely have any consequences outside of what items you got, how much experience you get or which places to go. Places are by the way scarce. The big ""open"" world is designed in such a linear fashion, that exploration mostly consists of going off the path for a few seconds to open randomly placed chests. Now linearity is not a bad thing per se, but in a game where there isn't much of anything else, it was the last hope to get some good out of it.

The controls weren't problematic, as I've played it with my gamepad instead of using my mouse and keyboard, as that is just my preferred way of playing JRPGs. So I can't say much about how it does control with mouse and keyboard.

My recommendation is to save your money for something better. The gameplay, the story and the exploration are beyond disappointing. Listen to the soundtrack on YouTube or buy it extra somewhere else and avoid this game as well as possible.",False,N/A,N/A,"Sep 17, 2019",2,Metacritic

The level of difficulty become a real grind at level 18, and in that sens, there is a lot of grinding when you arrive at the chapter 2 of each character, and chapter 3 is even more higher in terms of level. I don't feel like there is a natural way of levelling except grind. Which I found dull to no measure. The sounds are pretty good. The graphics are also very nice for a semi 2d game. I give it 72%.

There is not just one story, but eight individual stories plus the overall story.  The writing is good.  Each character is distinctive.  For example, one character is a dancer who wants to bring smiles to the world!  I've never seen anything like that before.  It's nice to see happy characters who want to bring joy to the world.  Yet, there's also a thief character, who says ""heh, heh"" as she steals from townspeople.  This is the first time I've experienced this combat based on a break the enemy system.  The game runs smoothly on my PC, never a game performance problem.  In sum, a top quality game by Square Enix's currently best (or one of the best) developers, Team Asano.

Whether it's a feeling manifested by loss, disappointment, anger, a chemical imbalance in your brain, disease, depression, or any of the other thousands of reasons is ultimately irrelevant. The point is that most people have felt this feeling in their own unique way. GRIS starts with that exact feeling. A character that sees no colour in the world, no life, no meaning, and no voice of her own, with trials and tribulations designed in a way that actively set her back, trying to impede her progress. Gameplay-wise, many of these obstacles are very easy to deal with. However, metaphorically, whenever Gris overcomes these setbacks, she heals a tiny bit of her psyche. More and more life, colour, and joy is brought back into her world, which is beautifully realised with both the gorgeous art design and a sublime soundtrack composed by the band Berlinist.

Unlike previous games some characters lack depth and are in a way less serious to previous yakuza games.

the game combat system gets very repetitive and it is very slow. for people who use to play the game only for the sake of the main story, now have to be ready to grind a lot to be on the same level as the enemy.
combat system can leave you wanting to tear your hair and smash your head against the keyboard. a third of the time you will see your character running to the enemy and back to his position.

from my readings the developers had to change the project direction, because beat em up was not attracting enough players from the japanese market, but in doing so they took one of the core elements of the game.

the fights not only in the sub story but also in the main story became way too comical, a charachter would blow a kiss to an enemy lowering their defense stats, compared to the old games where majima or kiryu would scream furiously and charge their heat to pull sick moves.

the city is impressive as always the side activites too. the graphics is great, voice acting I can not complain always on point.

big minus points are the grinding you might need to spend 8 hours or so preparing for a fight. a fight can take 45 mins to an hour sometimes and it is less exciting and extremely repetitve, you would skip some turns with no action just to heal your charachters.

as someone who played yakuza from 0 until 7 I unfortunately might stop following the series or just watch a lets play on YouTube, because i can not put myself through a yakuza similar to like a dragon. I quit the game toward the last 3 or 2 chapters and started watching lets play while skipping the fights, during my own gameplay i left it on autopilot sometimes until fights finished and then I came back.",False,N/A,N/A,"Aug 24, 2021",2,Metacritic
Yakuza Like a Dragon,1121910,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,hertzian68,"This game is a mixed bag but overall it's a banal excuse of a yakuza game when taken into account the other 7 games in the series. We go from the legends and high level yakuza glory and drama with a Kiryu of dignified tragic grandeur and the other legends and their stories to childlike **** and bums with endless UI and dialogue that just crawls along. GAG. The writers LOVE orphans, they love surrogate paternal relationships, they love all types of perversions and all sorts of  videogame culture, we get it this is just over the top and does NOT fit in very well with the series as a whole. I don't play turn based combat games, it's too automatic and too UI heavy I prefer control over the experience as much as possible with the least UI in the way. One aspect of why I've played and replayed 0-6 is that it's NOT TURN BASED. This is serviceable but I did NOT play Dragon Quest so the references mean nothing to me. Ichiban seems to SHOUT his lines rather than speak and it sounds like he's on drugs lol. The larger maps are pretty empty and generic, even reworked from Y4/Y5 to my eye. I think Y6 was about 40gb, this monster is 60gb and for what? so they can shout MA MORE! BLOATED. The back stories are just not believable, although that's true for most yakuza games to be fair.

I will caveat that I'm about 5-10 hours in, and have heard lots of good things about the story, however honestly I don't really care about stories anyway unless they're unbelievable and unique. So far this feels a bit pretentious and isn't really resonating with me

Hate the autosave mechanic, derives from Dark Souls but worse and adds nothing. The map is also awful, trying to force exploration but within quite an empty, uninteresting world 
The map design is also very poor. I have spent up to an hour in several areas just trying to find stuff, leave areas or having to re-tread steps

Enemy design has very little variety and for the first 5 hours it felt like most enemies were damage sponges (although that is improving now)

TLDR:
Pros:
-Good visuals, although not amazing
-Combat does look cool at times 
-Interesting premise
-Music is good at some points and quite unique

Cons:
-Very unintuitive
-Story is hit or miss, and is heavily pushed in a very Japenese manga style, which can hugely drag pacing
-Not a fan of sexualizing the main character. Feels very creepy being able to look up your characters skirt with animations / movements built in by design",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 2, 2024",7,Metacritic

The combat system offers a perfect blend of speed and strategy, with the ability to switch between weapon types and utilize Pod programs for endless combat possibilities. The story explores deep existential themes through complex characters like 2B, 9S, and A2, with multiple endings that enhance replayability. The post-apocalyptic world is richly detailed, creating an immersive atmosphere that complements the game's themes. The soundtrack by Keiichi Okabe perfectly captures the emotional tone, enhancing both combat and exploration.

It doesn't fit with the serious themes which are going deep into Neon Genesis Evangelion fanfic territory. A'other one of those open world games which is a giant elobarate fetch quest. None of the items or weapons give you a game-changing experience. Instead the Rpg elements are too rudimentary implemented, they barely affect the game. And that several side quests are blocked without further notice or option going back, unless with the next character is frustrating. Especially since certain side quest have to be unlocked on route A first. That is my whole experience in a nutshell: tedious and frustrating. Even traveling on the back of an animal feels boring. I went through the whole ordeal and finished the game with all three characters and the first ending was by far the best one. The other two added a twist and meta modernist ramblings, but I honestly didn't care since all the characters are cold and unlikeable. The game never even gives you a choice to save X but give up Y like in the Witcher 3. There's no interactive storytelling with the 26 endings, just forced cinematics to one end that is worse than the other. Also the forced themes and parallels to our society were really tired. This game wants to be super artsy and deep but at the same time throws the most stereotypical anime clichés at the player, every occasion it gets. I want my 10 hours of gameplay back and wished I would have read a good novel instead.

You just **** around the environments the whole game. I'd say the game has a nice, relaxed atmosphere to it, but vibes can only carry the game so far.
The graphics are definitely nice. Yes, it's 2015 level graphics, but the overall art direction is great. Except for the cats themselves, which often trigger that uncanny valley feeling in the cutscenes. The music is sparse and amorphous. For the most part it felt very unintrusive, and intentionally so. I'd say it fits the game well, although there's a slim chance I'll ever wanna hear it outside of the game. I have to note though that some musical cues felt off at times. For example, there was this one time when I was just walking down an alley and this really intense ""action"" music started playing for some reason, even though there was no action going on in the game at the moment whatsoever.
The game design felt inconsistent. A lot of the objects are climbable, while others that look exactly the same aren't for some reason.
I wasn't a fan of the scripted events either. There is one early on in the game where you have to run from zurks and I failed it like four times in a row. Why? Because the moment you have to jump off the ledge you can't  press W+Space, you have to press just Space, unlike the rest of the game where W+Space works just fine. It's little inconsistencies like these that really ruin the enjoyment and leave a bitter taste in my mouth.

Dont Starve,219740,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,UncleEd,"Tedious game with a beautiful make-up. Don’t Starve is one of the more popular indie games of the recent years for reasons I simply do not understand. It does look charming indeed. In fact, it has beautiful Tim Burtonesque style graphics and the game easily grabs the attention of anyone who takes a look at the screenshots. You start as a character whose only goal is to survive as long as possible. Similar to other survival games, you farm, craft, build to stay alive. The first problem with Don’t Starve is that the grinding part is simply boring. Often, it feels like a flash game with a fairly bad user interface where you click, click, click with your left mouse button without having any kind of fun. If you are curious about how grinding can be fun, please check Terraria out.

Second major problem with Don’t Starve is the permadeath. I am not suggesting that permadeath is bad per se, it can be quite enjoyable when it is done right. In Don’t Starve, however, it turns the tedious game design into something unbearable. You may find yourself grinding for hours, just to die by a random encounter (and it won’t be your fault). Oh yeah, some might suggest “that’s what the game is about” or “you will learn from your death”. Just give me a break… By now you should have played plenty of difficult video games to differentiate good game design from bad ones. Just look at the Souls series. When you die, you know you made a mistake. Maybe you made your move too early. Maybe you did not block the attack when you were supposed to. And if you die, you may lose your “souls” and thereby some of your progress, but not the entire game. In Don’t Starve, unless you are playing with a second monitor with wiki open, there is no way of knowing what will kill you. The only way to learn about what kills you is to be killed by it. And then you will start over, go through the tedious grind for hours and die again for another reason you could simply not prevent. In Don’t Starve, you are Sisyphus…

Last but not the least, the combat is atrocious. Combat in Don’t Starve is literally the same combat in any of the other thousands of flash games. If you have a good armor, left click the enemy until it dies. Or alternatively, make the enemy chase you and do your attacks while you are on the run.

If dull, repetitive games with poorly executed game mechanics are for you, play Don’t Starve. If you have a friend who happens to have the same tastes as you do, play Don’t Starve Together. But if it is the art style that pulls you in, your valuable time would be much better spent rewatching The Nightmare Before Christmas.

At first it might look like a cozy little game, but you quickly realize it’s not—it’s challenging, but never unfair. The more you play, the more satisfying it becomes, especially during the amazing boss fights. Beating them feels great every time. My favorite boss fight was the Mantis Lords one, which almost feels like a rhythm game because of how perfectly timed everything is. The developers created a deep and fascinating lore, full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered, even though the narrative itself can be a bit unclear at times—it’s not always easy to fully understand what happened in Hallownest. The map is huge and packed with secrets, and every single area is memorable. After spending several hours in the game, you start to know your way around instinctively. All the characters are wonderfully designed, each one iconic in their own way.

Hollow Knight was a random exploding success, a genre definer, something every subsequent metroidvania is held up to and compared with. The gameplay loop is sleek and sharp, the map and currency systems solid, the charm builds customisable. Exploration is rewarded and there is no right way to play. The sense of wonder and dread as we explore the buried kingdom, the challenge of the bosses and the platforming, the utterly stunning world and character design, and Christopher Larkin's generational soundtrack, all come together into what I dare call the prime metroidvania. This game has held strong, the lore and horrifically tragic story keeping audiences engaged for more than half a decade, and is a prime example of how love for the craft always beats the love of cash.

Omori,1150690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,ThatoneHELP,"Omori, for a RPG made by a small dev team and being OMOCATS first game. Is probably one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time in the RPG aspect. Now the reason? The story, Besides the random negative reviews that sound like they were asleep while playing the game And writing the reviews. The games gameplay is fine, not anything groundbreaking but it is enjoyable. But the story, music and art (in cutscenes) is immaculate. It is the most deep game I have ever played, and I am confident that I will never forget this story, now I won't spoil anything because this is a game genuinely needed to be played blind. But if my word doesn't mean anything, you can search up OMORI on YouTube and you can see so many different YouTubers, big and small praising the game in thumbnails and stuff. It makes sense too.

The game has around 20 hours of gameplay and six years of real life development to flesh out everything from the story to the music and hand drawn and pixel art.

Now I get it, OMORI isn't for everyone, the game is rated M for a reason and it is not because of swearing, sex or violence (No Humphrey doesn't count), it genuinely gets that deep. And in MY summary? If you like RPG games OR like games or media with a good story, OMORI will GENUINELY be the closest you get to a MUST-PLAY (also it's worth the 20 dollars btw, crazy how pokemon legends ZA is 70 yet absolute dog **** compared to OMORI OR literally ANY other indie game.)

And key note, Omori in all is a serious game, so if you can't take it seriously, then you most likely won't enjoy it to the degree that everyone else playing the game did. Omori at its core is a STORY game. So I don't actually advise playing it if you don't like a good story, but if you do it's a near must play.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 26, 2025",10,Metacritic

Omori,1150690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Anonymus97,"Let’s cut through the pastel-colored fog: Omori is a confused, clunky mess that tries to be everything and ends up being nothing. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of mismatched genres—psychological horror, quirky comedy, slice-of-life drama—all stitched together with the subtlety of a Tumblr meme dump. The tonal whiplash is real: one moment you're navigating trauma, the next you're watching a talking toaster crack jokes. It’s not clever—it’s **** controls are stiff and outdated, a relic of RPG Maker’s limitations. Movement feels sluggish, menus are unintuitive, and the interface design is more aesthetic than functional. It’s like the developers prioritized mood boards over playability.Combat? A snoozefest. The emotion system is a neat idea on paper, but in practice it’s shallow and repetitive. Battles drag on with little strategic depth, and the pacing is glacial. You’ll spend more time mashing attack than actually thinking. Compared to other indie RPGs with tactical nuance, Omori feels like a **** characters are painfully flat. Sunny, Basil, Aubrey—none of them evolve meaningfully beyond their archetypes. They exist to serve the plot’s emotional beats, not to feel like real people. Dialogue is often stilted, and the attempts at humor land with the grace of a brick. It’s the kind of writing that might resonate with someone deep in a Tumblr echo chamber, but outside of that bubble, it’s hard to take **** let’s talk about the reviews. The praise surrounding Omori is almost cult-like, centered almost exclusively on its “sad story.” But that’s the bait. The game leans heavily on trauma and tragedy to mask its mechanical shortcomings. It’s emotional manipulation dressed up as profundity. Critics and fans alike seem so enamored with the ending’s gut punch that they ignore the slog it takes to get there.",False,N/A,N/A,"Oct 13, 2025",0,Metacritic

It’s about the POV / life **** who grows older and you see his life unfold. The start of the game you’re greeted with a ferryman who wants to hear about your life and then it’s shown blah blah, there’s some twists and turns at some point in the game yadda… basically the way the story is executed and reveals is so clever and I think the medium of vr with this blink mechanic drives the emotion home because, with blinking enabled, you forcefully don’t want to miss anything important, you wana not accidentally blink and miss out on a chunk of the story. I think playing the game with it enabled works well (I was advised to turn the mechanic off but I think it worked better having that experience). Metaphorically the “blink and you’ll miss it” idea is neat, for a story driven game you don’t wana miss out on a chunk of the person’s life or story and you don’t know what’ll happen next in their life. It’s an interesting and very emotional game, from the segments with the ferryman to the sound design, writing and voice acting it’s all ace and very emotional not only at the end, but just throughout as it throws around many heartbreaking moments so well, the littlest things are so sad to hear.Great short game and I get the hype for it.

The cutscenes, scene building, story writing, and animations were all very bad and cringe. The levels are all extremely short and small to really feel anything, literally 20secs each, at this point the game is more of a loading screen and horrible constant cut scenes. The voice acting was also really bad other than the protagonist. Every other character had horrible voice actors, those you commonly see in dub anime.

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,apeot2002,"Life is Strange: True Colors reclaims the franchise’s strength, but its weaknesses, too.

First off, I need to declare my bias: I regard the original Life is Strange as one of the best, most memorable gaming experiences in my life. I liked the prequel “Before the Storm” well enough, mostly because it gave me more of one of my favorite characters. Life is Strange 2, however, left me cold.

So when I say that True Colors felt like a return to form for me, that is high praise. This slice of life story around another teen with with supernatural abilities (supernatural empathy instead of time manipulation) making their home in a small community inhabited by quirky, well realized character (Colorado mining town instead of Oregon coastal village) is just as engrossing, charming and gripping as the tale of Chloe and Max was.

Alex Chen, an orphan grown up in the system and our protagonist, has had a hard life, but things are looking up for her. Upon invitation by her estranged but loving brother, she moves to the small mining town of Haven Springs, and right then and there the game won me over: This very first scene is incredibly bucolic, full of life, color and golden sunlight. You can practically smell the fresh mountain air. That was the first hook that got me.

The second hit home only minutes after, when I witnessed the awkward reunion between Alex and her brother. Both of them didn’t quite know how to deal with each other and the situation, and I could read every conflicting emotion, not only in the excellent voice performances, but in their expressions and body language, too, and it all felt so true, so emotionally resonant that I couldn’t help falling in love with these two lovable, damaged humans trying clumsily to connect to each other, the captured facial animations were that good. 

These two things, colorful, joyful art direction and charming, emotionally resonant characters are the great strengths of this game, and they made playing through it a joy. Together, they convincingly create the idyllic atmosphere of a tight-knit community living in the ideal small town. Or would, if the actual plot didn’t complicate things. There is actually quite a bit of socio-political commentary to be found, if you’re open for that kind of thing.

The plot itself meanders a bit at times, but still creates room for a few incredibly moving scenes, the odd successful twist and ultimately a finale that for all its understated subtlety packs an incredible punch. Unfortunately there are a few mediocre valleys between these peaks of engagement, and a lot of them have to do with the implementation of Alex’s superpower. While the idea of Super Empathy is fascinating and is used very well during the high points of the narrative, Deck Nine struggled to create meaningful everyday applications of it. But they couldn’t let it lie either, thus Alex has to empath her way through way too many two sentence dialog sequences with no import and no emotional resonance.

As a controller-based adventure game, there are few gameplay systems to be had, and the riddles here barely deserve the name. There are precious few things to be discovered away from the beaten path. Innovation is scarce, after you’re over the incredibly improved character animations. If you are not here for the characters, the vibes and the story, you might not have a good time.

But if you are, if you want to see Alex through her journey, smile with her, commiserate with her tears, you will find it incredibly easy to fall in love with her, and with Haven Springs. 

TLDR: True Colors is a return to form for the Life is Strange franchise. While it might be just one step above a walking simulator, this game will nevertheless charm you with its characters and atmosphere.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 10, 2025",8,Metacritic

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Ciocolici,"Life is Strange: True Colors, a game I've been eagerly anticipating, truly lived up to my expectations. As a long-time fan of LiS, I was curious to see how Deck Nine would handle this installment, given their previous work on Before the Storm, which, while decent, was just a prequel with an existing storyline. However, True Colors presented a completely original tale from start to finish, and boy, did they deliver excellently.

The gameplay remains familiar, but with intriguing new features and gameplay elements tied to the protagonist's unique power, adding a fresh twist. The choices I made felt relevant, and I relished the various options I had throughout the game. The graphics are generally fantastic, but there was one gripe that broke my immersion - witnessing sudden changes in texture quality when new objects or scenes appeared. Additionally, there were occasional instances of unexpected FPS drops that lingered for entire scenes, albeit these were rare occurrences, happening maybe three or four times in the entire game. Despite these minor issues, I must commend the breathtaking scenery and the phenomenal OST. The soundtrack, in particular, was truly outstanding, capturing that classic LiS essence. The visuals might not reach the level of DontNod's previous works, but they were still stunning, and the facial animations were incredibly impressive, surpassing my expectations even after seeing them in the trailers. Can you believe it's still LiS?

Now, onto the heart of it - this game screams Life is Strange through and through. It radiates more LiS vibes than LiS 2 ever did, and Alex, the main character, is simply the cutest, most lovable character the series has seen so far. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted and captivating. While it may not have outdone the brilliance of the first LiS, I found myself emotionally invested in Alex's story right from the first chapter (now chapters instead of episodes). Her heartrending backstory evokes empathy early on, which is a definite plus. I did sense that Life is Strange and LiS 2 were more expansive in some ways - not just gameplay or story-wise, but in terms of the world they built. True Colors felt somewhat smaller in comparison, though I still adored the story and its universe and couldn't help but make some comparisons throughout my playthrough. There were moments where I felt the final episode could have been handled better, though it wasn't bad by any means; it just had room for improvement in certain aspects, in my opinion.

In conclusion, I absolutely loved Life is Strange: True Colors. It successfully encompassed everything that makes LiS special - it was great, melancholic, intense, and captivating all at once. It captured those emotional highs and lows I've come to associate with the series, leaving me thoroughly engrossed in the story. While I personally enjoyed it more than LiS 2, it still couldn't dethrone the original LiS from its throne (no comparison with BtS or Captain, as that wouldn't be fair). More LiS games, please! I can't get enough of this world, and I eagerly await any new installments that may come our way.",True,N/A,N/A,"Aug 5, 2023",9,Metacritic

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,KinimodYunmi,"Dieser Teil zerreißt einen emotional leider nicht so extrem bzw. überhaupt als in Life is Strange und Life is Strange Before the Storm. Auch die ""holy ****"" Momente, die es zumindest noch in Life is Strange 2 gab, gibt es nicht mehr. Man hat leider auch das Gefühl, dass jede Entscheidung recht egal ist, da es in normalen Dialogen kaum was ausmacht und die EINE ""große Entscheidung"" der Episode ist jetzt auch nichts weltbewegendes, die Story geht trotzdem ihren Weg, man kann dadurch nichts verhindern. Wenn man sich die Entscheidungen, wie üblich am Ende einer jeden Episode durchließt, merkt man das. Man hat lediglich die Wahl einer Person was zu erzählen oder nicht. Das juckt die Story aber nicht die Bohne, bis auf an einer Stelle, die aber auch total optional ist, danach setz die feste, unabänderbare Story wieder ein.

Es ist kein klassisches LiS, wie wir es gewohnt sind. Die schockierenden Momente, in denen man sich denkt, oh nein, das darf doch nicht wahr sein gibt es nicht, man wird emotional nur sehr gering mitgenommen und die zwei Stellen mit einer, ich sag mal Offenbarung von der Story des Spiels her, kann man sich sogar denken. Hier wurde sich darauf fokussiert mehr Gameplay einzubauen, anstatt eine extreme Story zu schreiben.

Die Story ist trotzdem schön und da ich das Spiel ein Wochenende lang genießen konnte, vor allem durch die klassische Life is Strange Musik, die immer sehr gut zur Atmosphäre gepasst hat, kann ich dem Spiel einfach keinen Daumen runter geben und freuen mich schon auf das Steph-DLC, in die ich mich auch wieder direkt verliebt habe.",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 11, 2023",8,Metacritic

It's like picking between two apples - one is green and the other is red: at the end of the day, it's still an apple you choose. So when you've finished the game and you're looking at the charts of other players' decisions you kinda think to yourself: so that is all there was?

Then, when playing particular parts of the game, it suddenly feels like the character is a naive 12 y.o. girl.

Oh boy I never thought I would actually be unable to push myself to play this game. It was an absolute hellish mental torture. Daniel is just one hell of piece of **** brat childish and insufferable character. It's actually insane how insufferable he is. The relationship between Sean and Daniel is more unrealistic then having super powers, like who tf even have such patience would have to be a saint and a parent of this lil **** to actually treat him as good as Sean. Like holy mother of god couldn't they just have give us the option to abandon him and end the game early. In short, Daniel just spends the entirety of LIS2 **** up Sean's life in every way imaginable, and we're supposed to be cool with it and love him anyway, because blah blah he's just a kid. Sean's a kid too, and he sure as hell doesn't deserve all this. Anyway, I **** on this game enough, I stopped playing around midway in EP3 and the good things about this game are its amazing soundtrack and how good the art style looks. That's pretty much the only good things about it. Everything else is either average or below average like the super power of moving **** around is just inferior to what we had in LiS 1 and LiS True Colors and the story is just straight up dumb, Sean's decision is dumb and makes absolutely no sense story-wise and it's basically what the whole game revolves around. Oh and literally every single important decision is not up to you, Sean will just agree to all of Daniel's braindead moronic ideas that will keep getting you in all sorts of stupid troubles just so they can keep the story going.

First story and characters, I won't spoil anything but let's just say that you will need to strap your suspension of disbelief to a f-ing falcon 9 rocket for them to make sense.

As tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something I dug, and it was done wonderfully here. The setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. The ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and I am both excited for and terrified of the sequel.

(Sidenote I include with all Telltale reviews: Telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. Variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and I enjoy them when they do pop up in Telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. They're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. They influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. The joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. I think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, I'd temper your expectations.)",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 30, 2025",10,Metacritic
The Wolf Among Us,261030,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Beautifulyinsan,"Beautifully Written, Beautifully Presented. And for telltale the most Dynamic in experience, and if anything its not about branching paths with these games its about how you yourself engage with everything that will depend on what you get. and for me, the inability to not change some things is actually in the games favor, Because I would much rather have crucial points, and a focus be uncompromising. the Empathetic thoughtful and even emotion and intense writing have kept this game as the only rival to the walking dead. I just oddly wish the aggroget was higher then 80 but equally as so I see it as just, well its a perception on what is actually important in a game. For the type of game this is, its about the experience of seeing the world, seeing the position of Bigby and what happens to him, some things that you believe is more important, which again will not change everything but more or less, will change how you view everything in each subsequent play through. Your aggression and your softness, your approach to each character, it often change me, and made me feel a roller coaster depending on what I said, when I didn't keep track of what I said and whether or not this guy was gonna say the same thing anyways, I was feel the very grounded, tight and honestly intricate story that pulls no punches and containing bold plot twists. Immersive, and emotional to its absolute core, I just wish It was longer. not so short, only going 10 hours but It has no filler, just opting for you as a player to just feel everything and take your time, and feel the vibe.

Lovecraft would have definitely liked this game: a short story about otherworldly horror. Maybe cosmic, maybe afterlife. Just the way he liked it. But for me personally, this game was on the verge of a 7 because walking around this island was very tiring, and because the dialogues required you to react quickly. I hate timed quests, timed traps, and timed dialogues, so for me it spoiled the feeling of the game a little. And the tedious walking could have been easily fixed with at least small fast-travel, like 4 benches in different corners of the island. And that's it. Because of this, I didn't really like running and looking for red frequencies first, and then running around the island again looking for these damn notes... and also hunting for different endings.

I first played this game 6 years ago — I now reached an ending I hadn't found.
Oxenfree is a uniquely dynamic enigmatic narrative game that is as complex as the player's willingness to engage. It introduces characters begging to be understood despite their confounded pasts. The game challenges players to look beyond the surface, reminding us that all carry a history that shapes their present.
Oxenfree prompts players to reflect on the control we have over our lives. It's a journey through acceptance, illustrating that acknowledging the past allows for moving forward. I love how deeply one can dig for lore in this game, even extending to an ARG.

Mitigé. C'est l'émotion que je ressens à la fin de ce jeu.Mais c'est aussi celle que j'ai ressenti dès le début. Plonger dans un monde étant l'archétype même des clichés pour adolescent ca ne me grisait pas trop au début. (ma phobie les dialogues comme dans life is strange)Or, très vite le jeu a su apporter ce côté surnaturel voire même horrifique, je commençais donc à me plonger dans l'univers... je m'attendais pas à ce que l'eau soit si froide. Une grosse déception en fin de compte cette histoire et ce jeu. On est resté trop proche du jeu pour ado-bobo et ce, malgré quelques moments sympas. Cela est peut-être lié à mes choix de dialogues (non), d'ailleurs parlons de ces choix !Quelle honte, baser son jeu sur des choix mais ne laisser au joueur que 2-3 secondes pour lire les 3 choix qui s'offrent à lui, tout en devant comprendre la quantité abondante de dialogue qu'il ingurgite depuis un moment, et sans oublier la cerise sur le gâteau : les dialogues qui continuent pendant que tu dois faire tes choix sur ceux-ci. J'espère que vous serez rapides, vous avec 2 secondes, top chrono ! Non sérieusement c'est certainement la chose la plus conne que j'aie vu dans un jeu.Ajouter encore à ça un défaut terrible pour un jeu qui veut baser son expérience sur l'histoire et les dialogues : Le ""doublage"" atroce. Pas du tout au niveau pour ce jeu. Aucune émotion dégagée dans les voix. Que ce soit de la tristesse, de la peur ou de la joie, tout est plat. Dommage et fatal pour **** faut encore ajouter à tout ça, des décors pas beaux, des contrôles et déplacements relevant du supplice, et une bande son qui parfois, ne colle pas du tout avec l'ambiance du jeu. Je ne sais pas si cette contradiction est voulue, mais pour moi, c'est de mauvais gout.Cependant il y a un problème... l'ambiance globale du jeu dégage quelque chose ! Malgré tout les défauts j'ai voulu finir le jeu pour profiter de l'expérience jusqu'à la fin. Je ne regrette pas, même si le début du jeu m'a bien plus conquis que tout le reste.

I finished the game in two days, and I enjoyed this a whole lot. The storyline was good and emotional. I like how they put everything in place and I honestly loved how the characters got flashbacks from happy moments in the past. The background music was good and it created the typical atmosphere which fitted in the game. I really liked the genre of the game, it was spooky but at the same time pretty emotional, and the best part was that everything was unexpected. Not once could I guess what would happen next, and that's what made this game more exciting. The characters were greatly designed as well and the graphics of the game was just amazing. Here and there there were a few glitches or the game froze, but that's usually normal.

For people who are suffering from loss like I have, I would definitely recommend this to you. It actually helps you deal with the pain.

I would rate this game 98/100. There were some things which were hard to figure out and there could've been some guides through the game to make it easier. The map could've also tracked the characters at the exact spot in the location so that you know where you are going and if you are taking the right paths.

Little Misfortune,1051510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,PublicNuisance,"I have seen a lot of people online saying how they liked Fran Bow but didn’t like Little Misfortune due to the lack of puzzles. I can understand that because I have the opposite reaction for the same reasons. Fran Bow was a puzzle game that had a fantastic narrative while Little Misfortune is just a narrative game without the puzzles. I disliked the puzzles in Fran Bow so Little Misfortune was basically giving me what I enjoyed from Fran Bow and leaving out what I didn’t. The art style is great and carries onto the credits which is a unique one. The voice acting is fantastic. Both Misfortune and The Voice. There are moments which are sad, funny and in between and they nail all of them. Misfortune has a interesting accent and way of speaking which is a mix of child and adult. There are a lot of points which are pretty macabre, to the point where I surprised the developers took it as far as they did  but was glad they did. The nightclub full of hamsters comes to mind. I don’t think the game would have grabbed a hold of me the way it did if they had of held back. The music was also very interesting as it made me think of an Eastern European disco and a cyberpunk synth type of vibe. There isn’t much in terms of “game play” here. Most of the game is you making choices and interacting with the environment to proceed. I don’t say this as a slight against the game because the story was great. Had the story been bad then the game would have fallen apart because there was nothing else to hold it together but luckily it was good. In regards to choices when The Voice says that there are no good or bad choices, just consequences, they mean it. It made me think of the episode of The X-Files with a genie who when granting your wish would always find a way to warp what you asked for in a way you hadn’t expected. For instance a person asked for a boat and got it but then realized they would have to pay docking fees, maintenance fees and taxes on the boat that they hadn’t thought of and thus they couldn’t even use the boat that they had asked for. There are a lot of things like that associated with the choices you make in Little Misfortune so don’t try to over analyze it, the Voice will find a way to turn your choice bad regardless and I have to say that was a sadly realistic take on things from the developers. I was left with some questions such as just how Morgo was defeated; who was responsible for what happened to Misfortune; what role we the player played seeing as how the Voice talked to us as well but overall enjoyed myself. The middle part of the game had some stretches where not much happened in the story but it got past that.

I played Little Misfortune on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any bugs. There was an option for V-Sync; PostFX and resolution. Alt-Tab didn’t work. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were 3 save slots available. You could also just use the auto save feature if you wanted. You can’t pause or skip cut scenes. The game ran great with no drops in frame rate.

Game Engine: Unity
Graphics API: OpenGL
Save System: Manual and Auto
Input Used: Mouse and keyboard
Game Version Played: 1.0

Game Settings Used: V-Sync and PostFX on; 1920x1080
GPU Usage: 0-57 %
VRAM Usage: 685-1219 MB
CPU Usage: 3-8 %
RAM Usage: 2.2-2.7 GB
Frame Rate: 132-144 FPS

If you are willing to accept narrative over game play then Little Misfortune has a lot to offer. A great story; voice acting and art style. It has it’s limitations and leaves some questions on the table but overall I came away impressed. It is equal parts cute; macabre; sad; and funny. There is a demo available for those who want to try it first.

Little Misfortune,1051510,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,TitaniumDragon,"Little Misfortune is a walking simulator masquerading as a point and click adventure game. There are no puzzles of note here, and the game is a strictly linear path from start to finish.

I don’t have anything against walking simulators, but a walking simulator lives and dies on plot and presentation. And unfortunately, Little Misfortune falls short on both.

This is a game that is deliberately ugly. The characters are all deliberately drawn to be “off”, and everything is drawn to have a run-down and often outright creepy vibe. The main character has a veneer of innocence but obviously has had a messed up life with a messed up family, and the only really nice thing in the game – “Mr. Voice”, the voice in her head – is obviously evil, with the first thing he tells us being that Little Misfortune, the “protagonist” of the work, is going to die.

And while all of this can work if there’s a strong plot and purpose to it, honestly, this game isn’t impressive at all in that department. The problem is that Little Misfortune isn’t a particularly interesting character – she’s a little girl from a messed up family, and she is more or less the same person at the start as she is at the end. The entire plot of the game is an excuse to take us through a series of rather morbid areas while being led on by Mr. Voice, and while the game does try to misdirect us about when and how Misfortune is going to die, that’s really the only “trick” it has up its sleeve. The game is very transparent about almost everything that is really going on, and the overall morbid and gross-out “humor” that the game leans on wears on the audience after playing for only a short while. It is just too one note, and as I never actually came to care about Little Misfortune, there was nothing to connect with here.

I can’t recommend this. It is endlessly morbid, but the messed up humor of the walking simulator is basically three hours of variations on the same joke, and there is a great deal of meandering around before the work finally goes somewhere.",False,N/A,N/A,"Apr 3, 2021",0,Metacritic

Комбинации карт настолько предсказуемы, что уже через пару часов игра превращается в унылое повторение одних и тех же действий. Никакого разнообразия или инноваций — просто бесконечное перетасовывание одних и тех же карт.Графика и звукВизуальная составляющая оставляет желать лучшего. Скудные, однообразные визуальные эффекты и унылая цветовая палитра создают атмосферу, в которой невозможно долго находиться. Звуковое сопровождение не лучше — набор примитивных звуков, которые быстро начинают раздражать.Проблемы с балансомСложность игры распределена крайне неравномерно. Первые уровни настолько просты, что вызывают зевоту, а последующие — настолько сложны, что кажутся практически непроходимыми без использования специфических комбинаций. Это создаёт ощущение искусственности и несправедливости.Отсутствие глубиныПрокачка и развитие в Balatro реализованы на уровне казуальной мобильной игры. Никаких глубоких стратегий или продуманных механик развития персонажа.

Inscryption,1092790,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,johko,"I'll be honest. I was very much on the fence about whether I wanted to play the full game after trying the demo but I sure am glad I did. Inscryption is more than it appears to be on the surface and did not fail to delight me all the way through.

The card game itself is fun. It is pretty much a stripped down version of Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone, but the rogue-like campaign format suits it well as you can beef up your deck in ways that would be considered game-breaking in a traditional CCG against human players. If you ever fantasized about having OP cards in these types of games, Insrcyption can very much fulfill that fantasy. The drawback of that is that perhaps it allows a bit too much freedom; if you are at all familiar with the fundamental principles of CCGs and have some basic understanding of deck building and card value, the game will not be a challenge to you.

But I liked that. I honestly did not need the game to be challenging for it to be entertaining. I got to play it the way I wanted to play it, and that was fun for me. The difficulty curve is a bit wonky and it does somewhat lessen the impact by failing to provide a steady increase of difficulty, but this is a minor complaint on my end. The good thing is that it is highly unlikely that you will feel stuck or frustrated at this game for not being able to get through it. The focus here is on the experience rather than the challenge. Inscryption actually has a pretty elegantly integrated hand-holding system to nudge you in the right direction without being overtly obvious about it.

I have to praise the tone and atmosphere of this game. The music and sound design is perfect and the visuals set a unique, haunting tone. Even the camera movements bring about a sense of nostalgia without making the game feel clunky. There are certain parts of the game I would like to review but I am trying to keep this spoiler free, so I'll just say that it never gets boring and that there's always something new to delight your eyes and ears.

The weakest part of Inscryption is probably the ""puzzles."" A lot of these can be passed just by pure random guessing and maybe that was the point. If puzzles aren't your thing, you don't have to worry because they're quite frivolous.

Take your time with this game and savor it. Be creative. It's a good one.

Inscryption,1092790,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Bahia8000,"Interesting game. Inscryption is pretty decent, an adventure that changes gameplay and art per acts, tons of secrets, fun gameplay and a interesting lore.

Gameplay wise game is divided into 3 acts that play pretty different. They are each different in gameplay and style each with its own secrets. The first act is pretty fun, explorable, filled with secrets, great art style and a nice pacing. Second one and third one are kinda spoiler ish, but they change, the second one is more about strategy, you do your deck and also have a little adventure. The third one is similar to the first but its less luck based and more skill. The first one is by far the best, well done gameplay system and mechanics, more secrets than any other act, characters, a very interesting place you can walk on and its kind of short but it hits the sweetspot.

Art style and visuals are interesting, they are done with care and suprisingly good, the first and third act have a dark tone while the second ressembles more like a classic rpg (a lot darker). I liked most of the designs and i liked how unique it looks.

Story wise, there are 2 parts. The direct one which is easy to understand, but it is kinda generic, the first act does a good job in keeping it mysterious and interesting, while the second and third kind of abandon that or at least doesnt execute it as well as the first. You have the indirect one, told trough IRL videos and secrets hidden in the game which is pretty complicated, but can be fun.

As for other stuff, OST was decent, nothing id listen but fits the game neatly and thats more than enough. Controls and gameplay is agile for experienced players but you can play it slow until you know more the stuff. 

Its a fun experience, Worth 7-10$, it doesnt last long, after whatever time you take on act 1, the others are 2 hours each, second maybe less, third, maybe more. First like an average of 3 hours, but if you like discovering secrets maybe more",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 28, 2025",7,Metacritic

Inscryption,1092790,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nazrielau05,"Act 1 :I loved the experience. Like i'm usually not into card games at all but this game's presentation and art style in general absorbed into the game almost immediately. It's dark as **** but not in a way that you couldn't see anything, you see just enough for you to put things together and try to figure out the puzzle pieces in the game. The game has this sort of gritty feel to it. I don't wanna say edgy cause it's definitely not that, but it's atmosphere is creepy and unsettling enough to make me wanna piss myself(Positive sentiment).

Act 2 :This part of the game is probably the most controversial one. It changes the presentation drastically. Even though yes the core gameplay is still the same turn based deck building card mechanics, the visuals take a huge turn here. From a heavily stylized 3D gritty horror-ish art direction, it turns itself to a pixelated 2D perspective. It was a necessary decision to build a visual direction that could explain the lore and lay out the general gameplay effectively. While i do think this visual presentation breaks the previous act's immersion and atmosphere, it was inevitable for this game to present itself in the more usual card game aethethic. BEFORE it brings you back to it's previous gritty/horror-ish atmosphere in the third act. I'm getting way ahead of myself here. But with that knowledge in mind, act 2's visual direction actually worked pretty well for a change of pace in contrast to the game's often gritty visual style.

Act 3 & overral thoughts :Absolutely my favourite part in the whole game. The visual presentation is incredibly good, the soundtrack elevates the experience, and stack it up with a genuinely well-made deck-building card game mechanics. Another thing that made this game popular is it's lore, overral story, and the Meta usage of how a video game works. They legit access some of your steam file for **** and giggles lmao i love this game. The story, the lore, and the creepy atmosphere immediately caught my attention and immersed me into the game entirely. I love it. This game is amazing.

It's problem is, simply put, that it isn't an enjoyable system, and adding the two ideas together only makes for double the number of ways that you can be unfairly executed.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,RafaelGR,"PROS

- Unlike other TCGs (Duel links etc), Master Duel is F2P. With minimal daily grind anyone can make one meta deck per month.
- Smooth Yu-Gi-Oh simulator with great visuals.
-This game managed to bring back to Yu-Gi-Oh, players that haven’t touched a single card since 10-15 years ago. Also the replay feature is a great learning tool for not top tier players.

CONS

-The game feels empty. There’s only the ranked ladder mode and the occasional event for a few days every month.
-It can be very cruel for beginners, especially those that don’t even have knowledge of the TCG.

ONE LAST NOTE

This game has a different card pool (not up-to-date) and different ban list from the TCG. Many players find that a huge minus. But I feel that this is more a plus. This way there can be more diversity in the meta (for example Mathmecks) and also avoid bad metas (Tearlament tier 0 meta)",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 9, 2023",8,Metacritic

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cloudzy,"I've been a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh for as long as I can remember. And while not perfect, Master Duel is fine. Any deck, if the player behind it is a good pilot, can climb the ranked ladder into Diamond. It also takes luck but we don't talk about that part. Just some broad points from playing the game for a year:

1.) For a game that's purely a multiplayer online battle simulator, the economy in Master Duel is above other popular online multiplayer games. 2.) Being a best of one format leads to more degenerate strategies like stun, obsessive amounts of flood gates, entries strategies dedicated to infinite negates, and ftks, that lead to some games being just plain unfun to play.

3.) The solo gates in my opinion do a fairly good job of not only teaching players all 6 of the summoning gimmicks, but also give players a insight to a number of different archetypes in solo mode so they can get an idea of what deck they would want to make in the game proper.

4.) I do wish there was more prominent modes besides ranked, the occasional festival, and maybe solo (if you squint hard enough.) Even with casual, team battles, and duel rooms, they either don't do anything to flaunt or show those modes off, or the only real enjoyment you can get is with friends.

5.) I wish there was more of an incentive to push in ranked. With the same rank up rewards you find in Bronze also being the rewards in Diamond, I feel like asides for bragging rights, Konami doesn't currently offer enough to sit down and grind on Master Duel.

Overall, like I started with earlier, this game is fine. There's things that I both like and dislike in this game. Hopefully in the future, Komoney can fix the flaws present in Master Duel to have it reach a new level of standards.",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 2, 2023",7,Metacritic

The majority of duels are won before they begin based on the initial coin flip, because cards are so insanely powerful, special summoning and searching mechanics are incredibly unbiqutious and deck consistency is near perfect. Win conditions these days involve going first, and special summoning a field of heavy hitting monsters with various effects that negate anything your opponent plays. The player going second, loses before they even get to play a card.

The game makes no concessions for new players, you will be dumped in with very little explanation, no ability to pause the game, and a 300 second timer to understand what your opponent is doing, make your plays and complete your turn. It's not uncommon for your opponent to pull out a 20 card combo on turn 1 to set their field up and you'll be given zero opportunity to digest this information overload.

Visual (8/10) I like general sci fy design and drawing characters, but card design a bit average, for example in battle deck you can find a lot of card with same dagger, also after upgrading cards they will have same picture and same design, so you need to double check description, for card game is a minus. Also music is average and almost don't change in different locations. Interface is very important in card games. So my first impression was - emm another one messy over headed interface, but after some games I can say that it's very helpful, you just need to get used yo it.

Gameplay (8/10) Gameplay is very addictive because you constantly upgrade your perks, cards, get new one and you can check different playstyles through one party. Great Idea to have more playable characters with different styles and story missions. On the other hand not so many perks are really unique and main strategy is pretty straightforward.

Story (7/10) Story is pretty average, but I really like characters. And the fact that to know full picture you need to play this game more than one time. I think that all sci-fi lovers can fnd some references to different universes.

Gordian Quest,1296610,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Pteromyin0,"Deep, varied turn-based deckbuilding RPG with accessability options to switch off permadeath.

Story mode with 2D maps and quests is a great addition to the linear and repetitive structure of Slay the spire, which playstyle is covered with ""realm mode"". It's hard to put the game down.

However, the many (many!) mechanics are not perfectly balanced yet, a lot of the options thrown at you are not properly introduced and kind of overwhelming, as it is very easy to **** up your build while progressing, at least the first time you play.

Gordian Quest,1296610,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Sepherim,"Gordian Quest sin duda es un juego excelente, uno de los mejores juegos de cartas para un jugador que he jugado y ya van unos cuantos. La campaña no tiene una historia memorable, es cierto, pero cumple bien. Y fuera de eso, todo lo que es la jugabilidad, la diferencia entre los distintos personajes, la mejora de los mismos y las barajas, etc. Todo ello es simplemente inmejorable, y además tiene básicamente contenido infinito, siempre puedes ir haciendo más cosas, subiendo más niveles, haciendo dungeons y cosas así aleatorias y más difíciles. Los enemigos también están muy bien diseñados, con variedad de estilos y ataques. Y, finalmente, creo que es de los pocos juegos de cartas que consiguen hacer que el posicionamiento en el mapa de combate realmente sea muy significativo, interesante y divertido.

Gráficamente el juego peca un poco en el sector de las animaciones, pero las ilustraciones de personajes y escenarios están muy bien. El sonido también cumple bien, con una música que acompaña bien a los eventos y efectos de sonido apropiados. Y, al menos en mi experiencia, no me he encontrado con ningún bug.

Y voy a ser sincero. Lo consideré sobrevalorado en su momento, y lo sigo considerando así. Tuve que terminarme este juego a remolque. Y odio hacer eso cuando quiero jugar a un juego, pues me deja eso de que no quiero volver a tocarlo más en mi vida.
El apartado gráfico: meh, no es nada malo, pero eso no salva lo poco inspirado que está el diseño artístico.
La música: podría dedicar tiempo a escucharla, pero el resto de apartados hizo que la música quedara en un cuarto plano. Lo que me da bastante repelús son las ""voces"" que les pusieron a los personajes, ese horrible balbuceo que le metieron a Celeste es un dolor en el oído. Hace que no me tome la historia del juego en serio.
Y hablando de la historia: ni siquiera tiene una historia, sino una EXCUSA para perder mi tiempo y paciencia en este horrible juego.
El diseño de niveles: a los creadores del juego, se nota que odian los videojuegos pero les gusta sacar dinero fácil. Era buena idea combinar mecánicas de Metroidvania con diseños propios de un demente? Si este juego hubiese sido creado con mecánicas de los 90 (vidas limitadas y sin guardar partida), muchos jugones irían a sus casas con antorchas para lincharles.
Y la jugabilidad: sería muy buena si no fuese por el planteamiento del diseño de niveles. Cuanto daño hicieron juegos como Hollow Knight, o Super Meat Boy (aunque SMB es muy divertido y por lo menos da unos respiros en un nivel).

Cuphead,268910,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,johko,"For years I had been eyeing the infamous Cuphead, the notoriously difficult run-and-gun platformer that made everyone throw their hands up and say ""this game is hard."" I was never all that into run-and-gun games – the only ones I enjoyed were I Wanna Be the Guy and Valorant (hah). Megaman wasn't really my thing and I always associated the run-and-gun genre with confusing hitboxes and awkward controls. I knew that Cuphead was visually stunning -- I could never stop looking at it – but I just wasn't sure if it was fun. Still, its reputation of being a truly difficult game drew me in and I gave it a shot. And it's fun. Really fun.

I'm not good enough of a writer to give Cuphead the praise it deserves in the art and sound department. It's a masterpiece. Tasteful, clever, delightful, pristine, maybe even flawless – these words come to mind when I think about what Cuphead looks and sounds like. But you knew that because you've seen the trailer and the promotional art and probably also watched some streamer or Youtuber play it. So read on to learn more about how the game actually plays.

One aspect of the game that I didn't expect to enjoy so much and also enjoy more and more as I play the game is the customizable loadout feature of the game. Being able to switch weapons, ultimate abilities, and charms seemed unnecessary at first, complicating what could have been an elegantly simple game. But I had so much fun switching out my weapons and abilities to suit my playstyle for each level that I can't imagine playing Cuphead any other way.

One of the coolest things about Cuphead is the strategic element. Make no mistake: Cuphead is first and foremost a skill-based game. You won’t be able to “strategize” your way up to the Devil if you don’t have some basic platforming skills, at least not on “regular” mode. However, I’d venture to say that you’d have an almost equally difficult time if you don’t use your brain. I went into Cuphead expecting it to be a muscle-memory trainer in that I’d just play each level that was impossibly difficult over and over again until my fingers somehow learned how to dodge every attack and get the win. But I noticed that I could make a boss considerably easier just by studying the patterns and strategizing the most optimal moves. Where are the safest areas of the screen? When is the best time to switch weapons to maximize damage? Should I hang up in the upper portion of the screen to lob torpedoes or hang back to preserve my life? I found that I could magically make certain sequences that initially seemed impossible into cakewalks just by playing smart. And that is not a bad thing. Cuphead is not only an action-packed finger gym but also a game about experimentation and creative thinking.

Now, I'm going to start nitpicking. My main gripe about the actual gameplay of Cuphead is the frustrating RNG projectile moments. If projectile A is coming at me and I jump to evade it... and projectile B launches while I'm still in my evasion arc from projectile A and collides with me, I get frustrated. Now, you might just tell me to ""get good"" or whatever because there are probably Cuphead-heads out there that can 100% the game without taking a tick of damage but at my level, I have definitely felt robbed of my life just due to bad luck. It’s not a big problem, and I get why the RNG is in there but that didn’t make it any less frustrating.

Another small detractor from the game was the order of difficulty. Maybe I found a style of gameplay that made certain bosses easier, but I felt that some bosses were way out of order in terms of difficulty. Not a huge gripe, but why is the Devil easier to beat than some of the earlier bosses?

All-in-all, I love Cuphead. My plan for this game was simply to beat it so I could tell people that I beat Cuphead. I didn’t need all the perfect scores or anything like that, I was never one to be attracted by the idea of 100%-ing a game. I was going to beat it once, write this review, and be done with it. But I’m still playing. I can’t stop. I don’t know what I’ll do if I stop playing this game.

Ce côté cartoon rend sa complétion très satisfaisante d'autant plus que l'on peut y jouer à deux. Certains boss peuvent paraitre insurmontable mais comme un jeu Fromsoftware il suffit de s'accrocher pour y arriver. Je recommande d'y jouer à deux la frustration y est moins présente même si les boss ont évidemment plus de vie. En point négatif on peut tout de même noter une trop grosse différence de la puissance des améliorations disponibles et les niveaux run&gun qui sont bien en dessous des boss (même si ces  niveaux ne sont pas obligatoires au final).

Bağımsız bir ekip olan Tour De Pizza’nın ilk büyük projesi Pizza Tower, oldukça hızlı tempolu bir 2D platform oyunu. Platform türündeki diğer yapımlar arasında bile kendine özgü bir yer edinen Pizza Tower, yalnızca platform oyunu hayranlarını değil, her türden oyuncuyu kolayca kendine çekebilecek bir yapım.

Oyunda Türkçe dil desteği yok ancak zaten metin miktarı yok denecek kadar az olduğundan bu bir sorun oluşturmuyor.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Peppino Spaghetti adındaki İtalyan restoran sahibi, borçları nedeniyle dükkanını kapatmak zorunda kalır. Bu borçları ödeyebilmek için ise Pizza Tower’a girer. Yani hikâye oldukça basit ve oyunun da hikâye anlatımına önem vermemesi, bunu bir sorun olmaktan çıkarıyor.
Oyun yapısı şöyle ilerliyor: Her katta 4 bölüm bulunuyor. Bu bölümlerden kazandığınız paralarla bir boss odası satın alıyorsunuz. Boss’u yendiğinizde bir sonraki kata geçiyorsunuz. Döngü bu şekilde devam ediyor. İlk bakışta metroidvania havası verse de aslında oldukça bölüm bölüm lineer bir ilerleyişi var.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Pizza Tower genel olarak basit ama akıcı bir oynanışa sahip. Bir saldırı tuşunuz, bir zıplama tuşunuz var. Zıplarken saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “slam attack”, yukarı doğru saldırı tuşuna basarsanız “jump attack” yapıyorsunuz. Oyunu özel kılan en önemli mekanik ise koşu tuşu. Bu sayede hızlanarak hem parkuru çok hızlı geçebiliyor hem de hızlanma ile gelen mini mekani̇kleri kullanarak basit kontrolleri çok daha çeşitli hâle getirebiliyorsunuz. Kısacası: Öğrenmesi kolay, ustalaşması zor.

Savaş mekaniği de basit. Ana amaç hızlı ilerlemek olduğundan düşmanlar, neredeyse “yürüyen tuzak” gibi. Yeterli çeşitlilikleri var ve boss’lar dışında tüm düşmanlar tek vuruşta ölüyor, böylece tempoyu bozmuyorlar.

Boss savaşları ise şaşırtıcı derecede başarılı. Her boss’un iki fazı var. İlk fazda 4-5 farklı saldırı kullanıyorlar, ikinci fazda ise hem bu saldırılar hızlanıyor hem de sahaya ekstra düşmanlar ekleniyor. Sonuç: kaotik ama keyifli dövüşler.

Keşif elementleri üçe ayrılıyor: 10 dolar veren kafesler , üç gizli mini oda , önce anahtarını bulup ardından girebileceğiniz gizli oda. Kafesler ilerleme için zorunlu, diğerleri ise tamamlanma yüzdesini ve bölüm puanınızı artırıyor.

Basit yapısına rağmen, sadece bu koşu mekaniğiyle bile oyunun bu kadar eğlenceli olması , sadece belirli bir şeyi güzel yapmanın bile bazen yeterli olacağına kanıt niteliğinde.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun, elle çizilmiş hoş cartoon gibi bir sanat tarzına sahip. Mizahi tonu, karakter tasarımları ve bölüm dizaynıyla uyum içinde. Ortam tasarımları hem eğlenceli hem de tema ile bütünleşmiş.

Müzikler ve ses efektleri beklentinin üzerinde. Her parça, oyunun enerjik temposuna uyum sağlıyor. Sesler ise hem mizahı hem de atmosferi destekleyici.

️️Teknik Durum ve Performans️️

Teknik açıdan kusursuz. Hiçbir hata, bug veya optimizasyon sorunu yaşamadım.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

 Oldukça hızlı ve eğlenceli oynanış
 Kaliteli boss tasarımları
 Mükemmel sanat tarzı
 Güzel mizah
 Harika ses ve müzikler

Pizza Tower, türündeki çoğu oyundan ayrılarak herkesin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım. Zorluğu aşırı değil ama kolay da sayılmaz. Bundan rahatsız olanlar uzak durabilir. Ancak farklı ve enerjik bir deneyim arayan herkesin denemesi gereken bir oyun.

Pizza Tower,1070560,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,ScrempBootyCall,"I didn't really want to play Pizza Tower at all because I thought it looked gross, but I promised my friend that I'd play it if they played Ghost Trick and here we are. The game does look gross but in like a sick nasty radical way. It is astounding how good it feels to move fast in this video game and I don't understand how Sonic couldn't do this for 25 years. Every part of Peppino's arsenal feels specifically made to make going fast feel like you just had intercourse in a sick nasty radical way. I love his dives and his different speedy punches they're really fun. I used to hate little things about Peppino's moveset like the way he dashes and the different ways that he throws enemies, but the more I play the game the more I am just infatuated with the way he does everything. It might be my favorite game to control behind Celeste it is so insanely good.

The animation is so incredibly amazing. If you hold down the taunt button Peppino just starts busting it down sexual style and that's chill. I love the little Tv in the top right that shows little buddy and how much character it gives him. I'm usually not paying attention because of how fast he is going but every so often I'll take a little peaksie up at the screen and this jokester will be making a very funny face! John Gutter is so fugly that it won't seem like it at first but every single other stage is an absolute feast to the eyes.

Speaking of the stages, it is amazing what lengths that they've gone to making every single one so unique. One stage you'll be running through the desert into a UFO and then you're going to space and then you're at the whims of Mort the Chicken from the hit game Mort the Chicken on the PS1 and then you're in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria and then you are in war it is so fun. A big part of the stages that I love is that the devs are not afraid to make a gimmick to fit a stage and keep it in the stage. I love Mort the Chicken as much as the next guy but I don't think he would really fit any other stage in the game, and he doesn't need to.

When I first played this game it was a very low 8 out of 10, then after a bunch of time playing it was a 9 out of 10, and at the very moment everything finally clicked it became one of the easiest 10 out of 10s that I have ever experienced.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 9, 2025",10,Metacritic

I had to see what the fuss is all about, only to find out that this is nothing more than a generic 2D platformer. The pizzas with the red lips make annoying noises. The running animations are very cringeworthy. The pizza guy always makes incredibly cringeworthy faces. To make matter worse, there is a stupid TV on the right-top corner where the pizza guy makes even cringier faces. When you pass a level, there is music that is extremely cringeworthy. It is over-exaggerated and tries too hard to be upbeat in a pathetic attempt at making players excited when they win. It didn't make me excited in the slightest. All this cringe made me grab my monitor and slam it against the floor out of frustration. There is no multiplayer, but I didn't expect one at a cheap price. Did I say cheap? The greedy developers are charging $20 for a flash game. I immediately refunded this garbage after nearly 2 hours. I don't want to torture myself any further with this garbage. Besides, there are plenty of free flash games on the internet. I don't recommend this game at all, unless you like looking at cringeworthy faces literally every second. ● P.S. I originally wrote this review back in early 2023, so that's when it ranked #1 on Steam and I had to see what all the fuss is about. All the crazy things that happened to me this summer made me realize it's best for me to just quit gaming altogether. College Football 25 would've been my last review. I have 0 faith on these lazy and greedy devs, so that was the plan. But after the deletion of this review, I'll postphone my departure. I'm not letting you toy-collecting millennials get away with controlling the narrative, and I'll let these devs know why it's a mistake to listen to you. I'll make sure they develop a highly successful $70 game (regardless if I like it) that will trigger the nerds, before I quit gaming for good. Anyways, I slammed my monitor because of this game. So it deserved this score, Metacritic. Speaking of which, I need to pick up a new TV after destroying it. When I come back, I'll continue gaming.",False,N/A,N/A,"Feb 28, 2023",0,Metacritic

Devolver çatısı altındaki bağımsız stüdyo Sabotage’ın ilk oyunu olan The Messenger, 8-bit , 16-bit retro tarzında ninja temalı bir platform oyunu. Özellikle Celeste tarzı zorlu platform oyunlarını sevenlerin ilgisini çekebilecek bir yapım.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Ninja köyümüzde sakin bir gün geçirirken şeytanlar saldırıya geçer. Tam her şey bitecek derken, Batının Kahramanı ortaya çıkar ve saldırıyı durdurur. Ardından bize bir parşömen vererek bunu dağın tepesindeki Üç Bilge’ye ulaştırmamızı, dünyanın kaderinin buna bağlı olduğunu söyler. Biz de bu yolculuğa çıkarız. Kısaca bu şekilde , oldukça basit görünen bir hikayesi var.

Oyun, başlangıç , final ve arada görünen minik sinematikler dışında hikâyeyi pek doğrudan anlatmasa da çevresel detaylarla derinleşen, özenle kurgulanmış bir yapıya sahip. Klasik bir kahramanlık hikâyesi gibi görünse de, aslında çok daha farklı , şaşırtıcı ve derin bir yöne evriliyor.

Oyunda bir “sahte son” bulunuyor. Gerçek sona ulaşmak için tüm collectible’ları toplamak gerekiyor. Ancak bu, diğer oyunlarda olduğu gibi sadece küçük bir ek sahneyle bitmiyor; oyunun içinde mantıklı bir şekilde açıklanıyor ve tatmin edici bir şekilde işleniyor. Bu yüzden 'sahte son' ve 'gerçek son' olarak 2 farklı sonun varlığı bu oyun içerisinde oldukça mantıklı bir hale açılıyor.

Harita tasarımı, başlangıçta lineer tarzda olsa da oyunun ilerleyen kısımlarında metroidvania tarzına dönüşüyor. Başlangıçta geçtiğimiz her yerden yeni bölgeler açılınca sanki yeni bir oyunu oynuyormuşsunuz hissi veriyor.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyuna başladığında oldukça basit bir side scroller aksiyon platform oynadığınızı hissettiren bir oynanışa sahip oyun. Genel olarak mekaniksel derinliği oldukça sıradan oynanışı basit bir yapım gibi. Bu açıdan oyunun oldukça basit ve öğrenmesi kolay bir oynanışı olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Ama oyunun ikinci yarısından sonra , oyunun mekaniklerinin zirve noktasına çıkmasıyla birlikte oldukça Celeste seviyesinde kaliteye sahip bir platform oyunu oynadığınızı hissediyorsunuz. Yani kolay başlayan ama mekaniksel olarak fazla gelişen bir yapısı olduğu söylenebilir.

Başta dediğim gibi oyunun gerçek sonuna ulaşmak için belirli şeyleri toplamamız gerekiyor. Bu toplama işlemi ise Celeste'teki özel bölgeler ve çilekler mantığında. Normal oyundaki platform oldukça ortalama zorlukta iken bu toplamamız gereken item'ları almak için yapmamız gereken platformlar oldukça zor ve oyunun mekaniksel derinliğini uç noktalara kadar kullanacak şekilde dizayn edilmiş.

Harita tasarımı başta oldukça sade , sadece aralarda gizli odalar bulduğun gizli odalarla ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra metroidvania'ya dönen bir yapıya evriliyor ve oyunda daha önce gittiğiniz her bölgeden yepyeni bölgeler ortaya çıkıyor.

Düşman çeşitliliği az ama yerinde. Gereksiz sayıda düşman yerine, platform tasarımını öne çıkaran bir denge tercih edilmiş. Her bölgenin kendine özgü teması var ve çoğu bölümün sonunda kaliteli, çok aşamalı boss dövüşleri bulunuyor. Bu boss'ların kalitesinin oldukça üst seviyede olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Hepsi genel olarak 2 ya da 3 faza sahip şekilde tasarlanmış ve birbirinden tamamıyla farklı tarzda boss'lar.

️Ek Olarak️

Oyun kendine özgü çok güzel bir sanat tasarımı kullanmış. Oyunun başında oynadığımız karakter ile oyun 8-bit eski tarzda ilerlerken belirli bir dönüm noktasından sonra oyun karakteri 16-bit tarzla değişen bir şekilde tasarlanmış. Böylelikle çok güzel bir görüntü çeşitliliği ve kendine haslık yaratılmış. Zaten retro havasını oldukça benimseyen bir yapı olduğundan animasyonlar ve genel tasarım oldukça buna bağlı kalmış ama aynı zamanda modernliği de hala kendinde barındırmakta.

Müziklerin oldukça kaliteli olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Her bölgeye özel birden fazla müzik bestesinin yapıldığı ve hepsinin belirli bir kalite seviyesinin üstünde olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

Oyunun en iyi yaptığı şeylerden biri mizah. Mizah ise oyunun en güçlü yanlarından biri. Dördüncü duvarı sık sık kıran, absürt ve kendini ciddiye almayan bir anlatımı var. Cidden çok özel bir yapım.

Çok Oyunculu ve Ek İçerikler 

Oyun bittikten sonra bedava olacak şekilde 3 boss dövüşünün ve 2 farklı bölgenin eklendiği bir DLC'ye sahip. Bu DLC genel olarak oyunun yaptığı seviyede bir kaliteyi korurken aynı zamanda kendine özgü ana oyunda hiç görmediğimiz çok mükemmel mekaniksel değişiklikler de getirmiş.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

Oyunun son yarısının aşırı üst seviye olması
Güzel evrimleşen bir platform
Oldukça fazla karakter gelişimi
Kaliteli müzikler
Oldukça komik ve kaliteli mizah

Oyunun ilk yarısının oldukça ortalama kalması
Oyunun metroidvania'ya dönmesinden sonra önceden geçtiğimiz yerleri tekrar tekrar dolanma gereksinimi

The Messenger, Celeste seviyesinde kaliteli bir platform deneyimi sunarken, kendine has mizahı , mekanikleri ve sürprizleriyle öne çıkıyor. Oynayan herkesi memnun edecek özel bir yapım. Kesinlikle tavsiye ederim.

The Messenger,1276390,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Korelis,"A cute retro-style indie platformer, just like many other games in this genre. But oh boy does this game feel different. First, let's begin by what really matters : gameplay. This game is really fluid, with quick but still precise movement. The characters are a masterpiece of design, with their own sense of humour, quite absurd yet very effective. The time travel mechanic, with this completely different 16-bit style is a great game mechanic, that allows for exciting challenges. The Metroidvania part where the levels that you got through in a classic left-to-right 2D platformer show much more depth is a great idea, although some may find it a bit repetitive. And finally, the OST. Probably one of my favorites OST, with this 8-bit style music that where most songs ended up on my playlist. The NewGame+ mechanic also allows for some replayability if you really enjoy the game.

The Messenger,1276390,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) The Messenger es un juegazo. Y es que cuando lo empiezas te esperas que es un plataformas más, que está entretenido, pero ya está. Créeme que no. Por si acaso quieres jugarlo, va a contener spoilers la reseña, así que te recomiendo no seguir leyendo o leer sabiendo las consecuencias. Después de esa parte plataformera, el juego se convierte en un metroidvania sobresaliente que también combina de forma magistral la exploración y el plataformeo, haciéndolo un indie maravilloso. Voy a hablar largo y tendido, así que poneros cómodos y empezamos.Jugablemente, es una maravilla. Al principio nos presenta un plataformas de juego de los 80 que está bastante bien. Un diseño de niveles bastante bueno, bastantes mecánicas que hacen a cada zona única, unas boss-fights increíbles y unos controles y mecánicas de movimiento sobresalientes. Hasta aquí, el juego está bastante bien, pero es que en un momento el juego pega un giro tremendo y ahora sorpresa, puedes viajar en el tiempo y tienes que recorrer todas las zonas como si de un metroidvania se tratase. Esto puede sonar a extensión artificial. Pero es que aquí reside el núcleo y mejores partes del **** exploración que se luce The Messenger es una barbaridad. Recorrer los mundos es una gozada (gracias a las anteriormente mencionadas mecánicas de movimiento y controles) y realmente sientes que hay muchas cosas por hacer en zonas que son realmente pequeñas. Los sellos de poder, por ejemplo, expanden la exploración una barbaridad y nos permiten tener retos más difíciles apartados de la historia principal. Pero de la mecánica principal que quiero hablar es de los viajes en el tiempo.Estos nos permiten alternar entre los 8 y 16 bits (cosa que le da un toque cómico al juego) y así cambiar el entorno en el que estamos. Esto al principio no se nota mucho, pero la mecánica se desarrolla muchísimo a lo largo del juego, basando muchos puzzles del entorno solo en cambiar de tiempo para poder avanzar o teniendo hasta mecánicas únicas en una línea que no hay en la otra. Donde más me han gustado las ideas a mí ha sido en el futuro. Siento que hay más variedad de jugabilidad, las boss-fights son sobresalientes y tiene mecánicas únicas que lo hacen diferente.Audiovisualmente, es un 10. El juego visualmente es incrreíble, tanto en el estilo de 8 como en el de 16, ofreciendo un diseño de zonas, enemigos, personajes y de todo. Pero es que ya la banda sonora de este videojuego no tiene ningún tipo de sentido. No entiendo cómo alguien puede hacer temazo tras temazo y encima dos versiones y que todas queden bien. Es una barbaridad. Encima mientras juegas, es como volver a los 80/90. Increíble.Narrativamente, es donde me parece que más flojea The Messenger. No está mal y de hecho la trama me ha gustado bastante, pero cómo se cuenta la historia es un poco raro. Sí que es verdad que los personajes están muy bine hechos y tiene un humor bastante bueno, pero la historia se concentra sobre todo en el final, haciéndolo un poco extraño. Aunque lo compensa también con pequeñas historias que están bien. Está lejos de ser malo en este apartado, pero simplemente, es donde peor está el **** resumen, The Messenger es una obra maestra moderna. Que no te deje engañar ese estilo simple y de los 80 o te parezca que va a ser un juego retro, porque estás ante una carta de amor al medio y a los juegos clásicos, que sabe innovar en lo suyo y ofrecer un juego diferente y divertidísimo que te enganchará hasta que te lo pases.

- Great characters and dialogues.
- Great idea of platformer then mutating into mild Metroidvania.
- Weapons - not many but effective.
- Mechanics mostly are intuitive.
- So many Easter Eggs about previous franchises and games (Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads at least).
- Friendly to achievement seekers.
- Special secret areas.

Cons.:
- I hated that ""hit"" jump. Why didn't do normal double jump? Because of that some seal areas are quite annoying.

Thoughts-
Ultimately, however, Shovel Knight Dig manages to pull off just about everything it was going for. The new roguelite gameplay loop works quite well with the protagonist’s limited-but-adaptable move set, and the game does as much as it can to engender the “one more run” mindset.

Gameplay provides player with a huge variation of colorful and challenging level, yet there’s a casual mode, but I find original difficulty fair and giving player a satisfaction upon defeating a boss or difficult level.
Unfortunately I cannot say something like that about lore or story, the only thing I can say it **** it only serves as justification of gameplay.
Soundtrack is consists of lots of cool songs from some famous musicians such as Bossfight, Chipzel, Nitro Fun, Shirobon and **** the soundtrack is magnificent.

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DragonHeart000,"I first heard about this game from a YouTuber I watch on his Favorite Game Animation of 2018 video. When I saw it there I found it kinda interesting, how can a 2d game with just simple shapes be considered one of the best-animated games of the year? I looked a bit more into the game and figured the concept seemed fun and it had some songs I like so I bought it to give it a try and boy was it worth it.

First off Just Shapes & Beats 100% deserved that spot on New Frame Plus's video. The animations are sublime. You'd never expect to see simple shapes convey such personality but Berzerk Studio does it so well! Everything in the entire game is just loaded with personality and creativity to the point that you can just get a feel for the dev team behind it and how much they enjoyed it themselves.

The only negative note I have on it is that my typical rule of thumb is that I get 1 hour per $1 I spend but in this game, I beat story in 4 hours. Typically this would make me more hesitant to recommend but with how beautifully crafted it is I am totally fine with letting this one issue slide. This issue could also be taken care of if the devs release a way to make custom maps, this would become one of my most played games if that was a thing.

Unrailed,1116740,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LT_Gruber,"Fun game with fresh concept.

(Played via Remote Play)

There are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. However, Unrailed! has something unique. You need to transport a train from point A to point B, while completing the tracks under its wheels. 

You need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. The multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task.

After each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. However, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track.

When your little train crashes, it is game over. All progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. 

Unrailed! uses simple, ""Minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. The character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving.

The sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background.

Control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn.

Путешествие через бесконечные просторы генерируемого случайным образом мира, поезда и ваших навыков командной работы - вот что делает Unrailed! настоящим приключением. Задача строить железную дорогу перед движущимся поездом может показаться простой на бумаге, но в игре это становится настоящим испытанием реакции, координации и планирования.

Однако, несмотря на все свои достоинства, Unrailed! страдает от отсутствия глубины геймплея после нескольких часов игры.

The further you go, the more powerful the enemies and items are, the items you have become relatively weaker. You can still find stronger versions of your items later on, don't get too **** can't choose all of the scrolls. Sure, the extra health is nice but it makes you much weaker in terms of weaponry.

Mutations and damage are affected by scrolls, not just **** you die, it's okay. The fun is not in beating the game but playing it.

Dead Cells,588650,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,RandomBolt,"This feels a similar game to play compared to PSO or Diablo, when it comes to how you progress.
You get some pre-determined buffs after X deaths and collect cells to unlock upgrades.

What does not look the same is that the randomness aspect means you have to slog through the same dungeons looking for the way out, instead of getting to the new areas fast, as on more classic RPGs. The areas just do not change enough to be interesting.
It is the same type of upgrades scattered, same type of enemies, just spwaned differently.

There is a pretty big lean into increasing difficulty through not restoring your life, which can make this incredibly frustrating. There is not much room in the combat to feel you are getting better, it is much more related to what you pick up and what upgrades you can keep unlocking.

The massive christmas lights also don't help with enemy visibility and further deter from the combat being interesting.

Collectively, this has been the most frustrating game I've played in years.

The levels became more and more maze-like where it becomes less of a platformer and more of a search for the right path by revisiting the old areas over and over again.

The build system is the same - there's no variety or depth to the build - you choose one thing and focus on that for the entire run, because if you try to focus on multiple things, you won't have enough damage.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,MostaS,"Recently, I gave Deadcell another go, but unfortunately I found that the game's mechanics ran out of steam rather quickly, and that there was too much linearity in the game's progression, based on collecting cells to unlock upgraded items. This meant that I had to finish the game several times to see what would happen next, and then start again with an extra level of difficulty. After 1 or 2 days, I'd get fed up, drop the controller and never want to pick it up again to continue the adventure, and it was the same with Darkest Dungeon...

FTL is the only roguelike to have kept me going for more than 135 hours. And it's the one with the least scenery, and no carrot for upgrading your ship post-mortem. It's a game that demands insane creativity and great foresight to optimize your ship and the confrontations. All the elements that make up the game are both original and complement each other so well that it's hard to get bored even after hundreds of hours. The possible combinations and strategies are virtually unlimited, making each game unique! That's why, in my opinion, FTL is one of the best roguelikes ever released.
If you want more details, I've put together a review on youtube about this game :

 The positives
imaginative, diverse and fun combat systemthe number of possible combinations for your ship.
The uniqueness of each game, which forces you to think and find the best strategy to optimize your ship, making every run unique.
The music.

FTL Faster Than Light,263340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Molok,"FTL is composed of wide variety of possible scenarios that are arranged randomly to create a unique run. Each play is distinct and creates a personal story of individual player's struggle. Here is just another one of them.

I started with federation cruiser. Defying odds I progressed through increasingly difficult sectors before arriving to the Nebula under the control of Slugs. There I resolved a few challenging combat scenarios, taking heavy damage because I didn't encounter any appropriate equipment and didn't really have an opportunity to upgrade weapons in earlier sectors. Luckily I found one more advanced weapon in stock, randomly found earlier. But I couldn't power it yet, needing a separate upgrade. With that in mind I pressed on. Eventually I arrived at a sector that housed a planet with several moons. The slug found on the surface quizzed me about the number of natural satellites orbiting the planet and taking advantage of my momentous distraction stole some of my missiles, drone parts, all of my exp and most of my remaining fuel. With exp gone and without a way to upgrade my system I didn't have realistic way to win future altercations but I pressed on.
I encountered a dangerous ship. I disabled shields using my remaining missiles so I could actually damage systems using my pitiful lasers. All of my shots missed and I without ammo I couldn't switch to missile weapons. I dropped the shields, disabled the weapons, ordered all of doors opened to vent the ship of oxygen and concentrated the crew in one large chamber so they would suffocate. After they slowly and (I hope) painfully died I uninstalled the damn game.

FTL is based entirely on your luck. It is a digital version of Russian roulette. Some weapons, augmentations and systems are just better than others. If you luck out and get them advancing through the game becomes trivial. If you do not it is impossible.
I understand that it is alluring to some people as they like the risk. But I would advise anybody who likes to have any actual agency to stay away from the game.

There are achievements that you can collect and unlock bonus ships. Unfortunately a standard run seems to be at least two hours long and if you die before getting an achievement you don't unlock anything. In that case each minute of your life spent playing is retroactively wasted away. There is absolutely no payoff if you lose. A standard tagline for rogue-lites is ""Losing is fun"". But this game simply isn't fun.

On the other hand soundtrack is awesome. I would say that if you can get it without the game it's worth buying. Just don't buy FTL and don't give it any bump in it's statistics.",False,N/A,N/A,"Apr 24, 2021",1,Metacritic

Enter the Gungeon,311690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) Soy bastante principiante en esto de los rogue-lites, pero sé que Enter the Gungeon es un gran referente del género. Y después de jugar durante 10 horas, entiendo por qué. Enter the Gungeon es un juegazo que lleva muy bien el género. Ahora voy a hablar en profundidad del juego así que, **** Enter the Gungeon, tendremos que explorar las Armazmorras, unas dungeons de toda la vida solo que tienen como temática (intentad adivinarlo) las armas. Se dividen en varias recámaras, y en cada una hay diferentes enemigos, tipos de sala y jefes. Jugablemente es una locura. El sistema de combate es sin duda lo mejor, teniendo en cuenta que han hecho un sistema de apuntado que funciona muy bien para ser en 2 dimensiones. Al sistema de combate se le añade la profundidad de objetos (tanto activos como pasivos) y de diferentes armas (algunas muy graciosas por cierto) que hacen cada run realmente única. Los enemigos y bosses de las mazmorras (aunque me quedan muchos por descubrir, sobre todo jefes) están bastante bien y tienen maneras muy diferentes de combatirse, por lo que acabas haciendo estrategias para cada enemigo o boss del **** diseño de mazmorras del juego me encanta. Están se crean procedimentalmente (o en idioma normal, aleatoriamente) haciendo todo tipo de combinaciones. La progresión en estas también se siente muy natural, teniendo muchos tipos de salas que se van desbloqueando poco a poco y haciendo que cada run pueda tener algo de importancia, desde encontrar un nuevo NPC o conseguir un nuevo objeto que no habías visto nunca. El hub principal (que se llama la Brecha) también está bastante bien, aunque siento que es un proyecto muy a largo plazo (como todo el juego en realidad) pero que se siente muy bien al avanzar un poquito.Audiovisualmente, está muy bien. En el apartado gráfico, el juego tiene un estilo artístico muy bonito, que aunque sea pixel-art (algo que ya tenemos sinceramente todos muy visto) es muy bonito, con un diseño de personajes, enemigos y zonas espectacular y animaciones bastante buenas también. Y la OST del juego es una pasada. La verdad que tiene temazo tras temazo y me ha sorprendido mucho en este aspecto.Como me queda mucho narrativamente que ver (aunque puedo decir que los personajes que he visto me han gustado mucho y que el humor aunque a veces sea un poco absurdo, está bastante bien) termino la reseña diciendo que Enter the Gungeon me gusta muchísimo. Es típico juego que es bueno tenerlo instalado siempre por si acaso no tienes nada que hacer y te apetece echar un par de runs.

Enter the Gungeon,311690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Mene0,"This game is very good, however, it tries very hard to be more difficult and less fun than it is, especially with the random elements.
While the enemy patterns and boss fights are pretty much skill based, your experience each run varies WIDELY based on the items you get. Some items are great, some are just fine and the vast majority are borderline useless and unfun. I cannot express enough how much more fun rainbow runs are, because you can get some cool weapons and items and just experience more of what the game has to offer you. A lot of the time in regular runs I realized I just wasn't having fun because I'd take a lot more time to clear floors and bosses because I had to use the default weapon, or some terrible item and gun and run out of ammo for it. The ammount of times I'd restart a run on floor one/two because I got 3 D-C quality weapons in a row is more than I can remember.

The soundtrack is charming i guess, but none of them are anything to write home about.This game's strongest quirk is the mechanics. It's basically a 2D platformer game with metroidvania and rogue-like sauces. Also, in the start of each run, the game gives you an option to pick between 3 characters. These characters have their own class, abilities and quirks. Guess what? You don't control what you get. You only get to choose between whatever options you're presented ****'s not like Dead Cells where you could buy and sell weapons when given the option. It's not like Hades 1 & 2 where you get to put together your own build, combining weapons, boons, and other abilities and you stick with them for the rest of the game. In Rogue Legacy 2, your choices are basically locked in whatever the game's RNG is feeling like. This game does have permanent progression in the forms of upgrading your characters' health, armours, unlocking new characters etc. But the very core of the game's mechanics is still randomly generated. You're not fully in control of your runs.This game is heavily reliant on RNG, which in itself isn't a bad thing. However, it does kinda ruin my lust to 'master' the game's mechanics. Simply because I'm not in control of everything available. Rogue Legacy 2's premise is very arcade-like. Which makes the game perfect for pick-up-and-play whenever you want. Rogue Legacy 2 is a good experience still, and i won't deny that. It's just a very different type of Rogue-like compared to what I'm used to. Of course, that doesn't make this game bad or anything.

The concept of combining 2 classes (or races) is always great and underused in games. It leaves so many potential combos, and surprisingly many of them work well. Each race has their unique cards and combining 2 races' cards leaves some interesting potential combos.

Runs include a card selection after every encounter, as well as 2-3 activities of choice, including various types of shops, recruiting a unit, removing cards from your deck, copying a card in your deck, relics, special events, etc.

There are also ""challenges"" that you can toggle on or off on some encounters to increase your reward, but also difficulty. These can be interesting because the extra rewards is not always worth it depending on the circumstances.

This feels more complex than Slay the Spire and you need to manage which units you put at the front, which units on which floor, which enemies will skip a floor, etc. This is not that similar to Slay the Spire though, as you don't directly control a hero that attacks & casts spells, you summon units & use spells from the ""outside"".

Monster Train,1548850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Sepherim,"Monster Train es un juego bastante entretenido, a medio camino entre roguelike deckbuilder y autobattler. La idea es que vamos por el mapa escogiendo rutas aleatorias y formando el mazo, más o menos lo esperado. Pero las batallas se luchan jugando cartas en los distintos pisos del tres y luego dejando que las criaturas invocadas luchen automáticamente según sus posiciones. Los enemigos intentan matarnos y sobrevivir hasta llegar a la parte alta del tren, nosotros intentamos evitarlo y matar al boss. Hay cinco mazos de juego en el juego básico y lo cierto es que son muy distintos entre sí, dando pie a jugabilidades muy diferentes y estrategias muy originales con algunos de ellos; y, como se pueden combinar siempre en parejas, da para interesantes combos. Los enemigos y bosses quizás no son tan variados como podrían haber sido, pero cumplen bien su labor. Quizás lo que más me falla es la falta de una historia que anime a seguir jugando, ya que no hay historia como tal.

Gráficamente el juego no es ningún portento, especialmente en las animaciones que son bastante flojas, pero cumple con una estética llamativa y colorida. La música también cumple, sin grandes aspavientos, lo mismo que los efectos sonoros. Y, al menos en mi tiempo jugándolo, no me he encontrado ningún bug.

Monster Train,1548850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,savvym,"Monster train is a turn based card strategy where you fight your opponent inside the train, protecting the Spyre. It's very much like Slay the Spire with extra layers to the combat system. It's also less RNG as you know where you're heading to.

Each run starts by selecting one of two (three in total) superpower options for the champion and an artifact of our choice. There is also a temple (from DLC) which allows us to gain artifacts and various rare upgrades for an additional difficulty.

Our goal is to get through 9 rings of frozen hell in a monster train; that is 8 battles if we get to the final boss.

Each combat starts off with deploying your champion unit against waves of enemies. Most of the time, the enemy boss will be flying between the floors deploying some distractions and joining the forces at the last wave into the combat phase or simply spawn last. Until that time you're supposed to fill up all floors with units and buffs to survive.

The boss destroys the floor once it clears it from our units and it means we have less space to put units and less turns to beat the level. If the spyre falls, it's game over. Luckily, spyre still shoots back so it can serve as a 4th floor well if you've got dazed cards and increase its strength. We can also upgrade our Spyre with additional damage, armor, health and apply dazed to enemies entering it.

The cards have various effects and can be upgraded, having 2 upgrade slots by default. The best part is 5x duplicating double, triple or even quadruple upgraded cards but having so many upgrades on one unit is uncommon. Each unit takes up space in the floor so when they're full we can use magic on top of it, and it's wise not to have too many units without enough buffs because they will be easily wiped out in the late game so there should be a nice balance.

Another great feature is the alliance. We get to receive cards from two races depending on which railroad we choose or when we receive after battle rewards. We can make useful synergies, but sometimes allied cards just do not fit with our main one and only take up valuable space in our deck, but we can still get rid of them.

Between battles, there are events like merchants for units, spells and artifacts, special caverns, duplicate hellvents, remove vortexes and health wells. We can even gain an extra gold. And the best part is, we can preview our run from start to finish, however we do not know the outcome of special events. So it is always wise to first take gold, buy upgrades, visit cavern, and then take artifacts, duplicate and regain health.

Apart from those, we will be able to upgrade our champion 2 more times, once in mid and once in late game. We can have as many different artifacts as we get. They make the run easier in a way.

Early game offers 5+1 champions, starting at level 1. We can also play Daily Challenges which are always Covenant 1. That is where the PvP element comes in. We can create our own runs and share them with friends. Our rankings are saved after we finish the run. We can also play simultaneously with other players at the same time, being only time limited.

In mid game, we unlock the second champions and higher covenant ranks, probably reaching covenant 10 and getting used to all of the races in the game and learning some useful strategies. Now it is about making the perfect decks with a bit of luck from rewards.

We will understand the whole concept of the game once we reach Covenant 20. Upon reaching 25, we gain even more difficult challenges that are usually available to mix up in custom games. The game is significantly more challenging than Covenant 1 and we can even easily lose the first battle with all challenges accepted.

The game has a very high skill ceiling and me as an occasional card player, now only became an addict thanks to this game. I usually gain half or third of the best players ranked in the daily and custom challenges.

There are 5 races + 1 in the Last Divinity DLC;
Hellhorned - high damage multi strikers, rage and armor gainers focused on melee combat.
Awoken - high health gainers, multi strikers and sweepers with abilities to draw more cards.
Stygian Guard - incanters, frostbiters and spell users, low melee damage and starting HPs.
Umbra - unit eaters, lifestealers, damage shield gainers, a lot of small units, late high stats.
Melting Remnant - stealthers focused on resurrecting units and slow stat and gold gainers.
Wurmkin - eggs and worms, echo infusers, focused on making the floors magically strong.

Every run is unique, we can replay the same alliances and get different starting decks and meet different bosses.

There are 3 major bosses and 12 minor bosses; they are accompanied by many heavy and support units. There is also a bonus level with 1 more boss but I only got there once.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 12, 2021",10,Metacritic

With minimalistic controls but deep progression systems, it’s easy to pick up and hard to put down.Developed by Luca “poncle” Galante, this indie gem began as a small solo project in 2021 and exploded into popularity thanks to its affordable price, nostalgic Castlevania-inspired art, and wildly satisfying gameplay loop. What starts off slow quickly turns into chaotic bullet-heaven mayhem, with the screen packed with colorful enemies, projectiles, and loot. Despite its visual simplicity, it’s mechanically rich, offering endless combinations of characters, weapons, power-ups, and unlockable **** game constantly rewards experimentation and persistence. Each run earns gold that you can use to unlock permanent upgrades, characters, and relics, and players are encouraged to explore different builds and gameplay modifiers. Its DLCs (both paid and free) continue to expand the content with new stages, characters, weapons, and crossover content from franchises like Castlevania, Among Us, Contra, and SaGa.Content-wise, the game now includes local co-op, mobile cross-platform versions (with ads), and ports on nearly every major platform—including Tesla cars—and even has a live-action film adaptation in the works.With nearly 53 hours of playtime, one player likened the experience to a serotonin bomb, comparing it to the addictive mind-control game from Star Trek. It’s thrilling, hypnotic, and overwhelming in the best way—though not for the photosensitive.Final Verdict: An exceptional indie time-sink bursting with charm, challenge, and replayability. Highly recommended.Score: 9.5/10",True,N/A,N/A,"May 12, 2025",9,Metacritic

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Atratzu,"-Quick Review-Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in 2015. Crypt of the NecroDancer combines all the elements of a 2D Top-down Roguelike with procedural generated levels, picking up different weapons gear and items to make your “build”, all the while digging through walls and battling monsters in an underground dungeon to the beat of the music.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: At the start of the game, there’s a cutscene of the first playable character named “Cadence” digging in a graveyard to uncover the truth of her long-lost treasure-hunting father. She falls underground and the NecroDancer steals her heart and forces her to move to the rhythm of the **** Cadence plays through the acts, she will unlock new characters which will have different quirks, some helpful, some not so helpful, for example one character has infinite bombs, and another character can’t attack at all.

Gameplay: Movement is up, down, left, and right, some items require you to tap two directions at the same time, like down + left to drop bombs, and up + left to use an item (The Steamdeck assigns buttons rather than directional inputs. This game is great on Steam deck by the way). You attack by moving in the same direction as an enemy or attackable **** the previous mentioned movement must be done at the rhythm of the music, if you miss or skip the beat your character will NOT be injured however you’ll be at a “disadvantage”. You lose your gold multiplier, and the rest of the dungeon will move around you to the beat of the music, sometimes you’ll miss a critical turn and die because the monster got an extra turn. I have used this to my advantage once or twice… but the game definitely rewards and incentivizes the player to move with the **** experience at the start of each zone was “Oh no… there’s no way I’m going to figure out how to play this game”. Then after playing and dying on the same level for a bit, I’d make progress and get lucky with my weapon, armor, items, etc… then I’d get to the next zone, and we were right back at square one “oh no… this is when I’ll need to quit, it’s too hard”. But I did slowly learn the monsters’ attack patterns through lots of trial and error.

Conclusion: Crypt of the Necrodancer is a good game. I’d recommend it to people who enjoy rhythm games… maybe more so than recommending it for people who like roguelikes. Certainly, it has roguelike stuff in it, but you really need to like the rhythm-based gameplay, if you don’t like rhythm-based gameplay the game really won’t appeal to you in the same way. However, it does have options to make the game easier too, so it can be more accessible to **** you don’t commit to getting everything, you’re looking at roughly 13-15 hours playing the game as Cadence. (More or less playtime will be required depending on how naturally good you are at the game, and how lucky you get on your runs) And if you’ve got the time and motivation to really learn the game you’re looking at hundreds of hours of play. The game is a completionist nightmare, I wouldn’t recommend doing that to yourself… but completionists already subject themselves to that agony… what’s there to lose to a little indie game, right?

Crypt of the NecroDancer,462770,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,dogukansapmz,"Crypt of the Necrodancer bir rogue-like oyun olmasına rağmen rakiplerinden oldukça sıyrılarak önümüze orjinal bir iş koymayı başarıyor. Oyunun genel yapısı her bölümün kendisine özel şarkısının ritmiyle hareket etmek. Bu oyunun direk core mekaniği çünkü rakiplerimiz de aynı ritimle hareket ediyor ve biz ritimi kaçırırsak onlar ilerleyebiliyor. Bizim ritmi kaçırdığımız durumlarda kendi saldırı hakkımızı kaybediyor bazen de durduğumuz özel bloklara göre hasar alabiliyoruz. Oyunda 15 tane oynanabilir karakter var ve bu karakterler düz skin'ler değiller de oynanabilir oyun mod'ları gibiler. Mesela birinde sadece bomba kullanabilirken bir diğerinde hiç para almadan oyunu bitirmeye çalışıyorsunuz. Oyunda 10'larca farklı mob var. Aynı zamanda 7-8 tane miniboss tipi düşman ve 5-6 tane ana boss tipi düşman var. Bu mob'ların ve miniboss'ların aynı zamanda farklı skin'li halleriyle de karşılaşıyoruz ki normalde bu durum diğer tipteki oyunlarda çok göze çarpmasına rağmen bu oyunda düşmanların bu skin değişimiyle ayrı mini mekanikler kazanması ve bir  yandan güçlenmesi oyuna çok çeşitlilik katıyor. Mesela 1 cana sahip kalkanlı iskelete 1 vuran bir silahla vurduğumuzda direk kalkanı düşerken 2 canlı kalkanlı iskelete vurduğumuzda kalkanı yerinde kalıyor , onun kalkanını düşürmek için yandan vurmamız gerekiyor. Sadece mob çeşitliliği değil aynı zamanda en dış tabakası dışında tamamiyle kırılabilir haritadan oluşan bu oyunda aynı zamanda etraftaki blokların da belirli item'larla kırılıp bazılarının kırılmaması , çeşitli tuzaklar , 6-7 tane silah tipi ve bu silah tiplerinin de 4-5 tane tarzı var. 10'larca büyü var. Bunların dışında kafana , göğsüne taktığın zırhların ve taktığın kolyeyle yüzüklerin de her birinin ayrı özelliklerinin olması tamamiyle oynanışı değiştiriyor. Özellikle oldukça cezalandırıcı bir gameplay'e sahip olduğundan item'larınızı tam potansiyeli kullanmak zorundasınız. Aynı zamanda bu sahip olduğumuz item'ları kullanmak için sadece ''q'' ya da ''g'' ye basmak gibi değil de ''aşağı ok+üste ok'' şeklinde olmasından ötürü o hızlı aksiyonun varlığından ötürü elinin ayağını dolaşması , yanlış item'ı kullanmak gibi durumlar oldukça zevkli bir oynanış ortaya tutuyor. Oyunun genel rogue-like elementlerini de güzel kullanıyor. Klasik bir şekilde run'dan kazandığımız para birimiyle kalıcı upgrade'ler , sonraki oyunda karşımıza çıkabilecek silahlar , zırhlar satın alabiliyoruz. Genel oynanış dışında arka planda bir hikaye de ilerliyor ama çok da iyi değil zaten ana odak da bu değil. Hikaye ilerledikçe yeni oynanabilir karakterler açılıyor ki bu da ana oyunun setting'inden sıkıldığında minik bir rahatlama hissi veriyor. Rogue-like oyunlardan artık sıkılsam da türün diğer örneklerinden kendini tamamen ayırmasından ötürü oynanış sürem boyunca bana oldukça güzel eşlik etti. Türün sevenine kesinlikle öneriyorum , sevmeyenine de kesinlikle denemesini istiyorum. 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 16, 2025",7,Metacritic

Peglin,1637730,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,luberchris,"TL;DR Fun deck builder with a good challenge. No bugs.

I have high hopes for the future development of this game. It combines elements of chance through Plinko with deck-building and dungeon-crawling akin to a Slay the Spire clone, which is as refreshing as it is unique. The enemies are challenging, and the unlockable levels of the Cruciball mode add further challenges after each successful run. In addition, the option to speed up the entire game is a nice touch that helps with the grind. 

Negatives are few and far-between, outside of the normal frustration of difficulty. I may argue that more goblin classes (now unlockable), relics, or more orb types could add further variety to the game, but there is absolutely plenty of variety in the current state. I highly recommend this game for fun, quick entertainment if you enjoy deck builders with a touch of mindlessness.",True,N/A,N/A,"Feb 5, 2024",8,Metacritic

I stopped after the underground part, after beating ancient spirit I think. This was my first fromsoft game besides sekiro which is awesome. I did like the legacy dungeons. 

The open world is a time waster. You're really just going from boss to boss. The things in between are either worthless enemies or rewards which, 9 times out of 10 are also worthless. 

That'd be ok if combat was good but I find it boring, especially coming from Sekiro. Mostly stay away from the boss or dodge roll until you get an opening. Repeat until boss is dead. Vastly inferior combat system compared to sekiro. People will just say git gud but what's git gud even mean in this game. I had a lot of trouble against an optional boss, ancient hero of zamor I think, so I left and came back much later and whooped it. I hadn't gotten any better at the game. I simply had better weapons and leveled up. So it did not feel satisfying to me. That's really the whole point of these games, the satisfaction of beating a boss, but Elden Ring just feels like a chore to me.

This game got endless praise so I've watched a lot of criticism videos hoping to find I'm not crazy for not liking the game. I think it's odd that many of these videos called it a great game or even a masterpiece with flaws. That makes no sense, a masterpiece to me means as flawless as one can reasonably expect. There seems to be a culture around this game that can't accept criticism.

Suspiciously overrated by so-called ""pros."" 
I gave it 1 star because I personally disliked the game mechanics — not because it’s buggy. It’s an easy game, but frustratingly hard to play. The gameplay is clunky and takes a long time to get used to. There’s no story. No guidance. It’s artificially difficult due to the lack of information needed to play it properly. The difficulty is poorly balanced. The beginner tutorial is a complete joke. Combat mechanics feel outdated and poorly coded. The latency is awful and takes ages to adapt to. I’d estimate you need around 50 hours of practice just to handle the battle interface. Once you finally understand how to play and uncover the hidden mechanics, the game becomes boringly repetitive and ridiculously easy.

Dark Souls III,374320,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LuceLuna,"До выхода Учан это был лучший представитель СЛ который в принципе и породил данный жанр. В целом игра заслуживает оценки 7, но я поставил 8 только из за того что это культовая игра, теперь о плюсах и минусах. Среди минусов причем для меня очень значимых это сюжет. Его практически нет, и тот факт, что он в данном стиле практически не раскрывается не является оправданием, что игру создали просто как слешер в своем уникальном стиле без надобности для игрока что либо объяснять. Мало текста, мало персонажей, невзрачные пару секундные концовки, всё это огромный минус, для игры которая могла нести в себе оболочку смысла и сюжета, а не быть просто отличной сложной по геймплею игрой. Второй значимый минус отсутствие желания её проходить снова. Почему? А в чём смысл, если сюжета нет и ты не откроешь для себя ничего, что мог бы пропустить в первый раз? НГ+ в этой игре становится крайне лёгким из за типичной инфляции характеристик и уже заученных боссов. Последнее. Это отвратительные модели персонажей. Без шуток, главный герой просто создан быть уродом, как бы ты не старался создать нормального(даже не красивого персонажа), у тебя вряд ли получится. Во первых модели тела ужасны, они не естественны и корявы а лица это вообще кошмар. Самый лучший вариант это надеть броню на всё тело и закрыть это безобразие. Броня это единственное что хорошо сделано в плане моделей связанных с персонажами. Теперь плюсы. Шедевральный саундтрек. Один из лучших в плане погружения и так сказать подходит именно для этой игры на 200%. Геймплей, на первом заходе сложновато, но это также зависит от типа оружия, которым ты решишь проходить. Класс очень решает. Теперь графика, в целом она устарелая, но люди которые занимались конструированием дворцов, замков, архитектуры скульптур, они реально гении. Просто шедевральный антураж, который контрастирует с вашим уродливым персонажем. Странное ощущение. В целом это одна из лучших СЛ игр.

Lies of P,1888160,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,SzeBBe,"If there’s even a hint of Soulslike appreciation in a player, it’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t fall in love with Lies of P. The bosses are fantastic: never unfair, always exciting, and the game gives countless ways to customize difficulty—summons, consumables, or powerful weapon options—so how tough it feels is truly up to the player's choices. It’s often called challenging, but with these tools, the real difficulty is self-imposed. Lies of P gave me that “once-in-a-lifetime” feeling I only rarely get—in many ways, it made me feel the same magic as playing Dark Souls 3 for the first time. It isn’t just a clone; it has real identity, a unique story, and NPCs whose fates I genuinely cared about. The motivation to push through tough moments and the excitement of discovery are both strong, thanks to its powerful narrative. Krat, the city you explore, is incredible—dense, atmospheric, and refreshingly straightforward. I’m grateful it isn’t another bloated open world; instead, it strikes a balance, offering side routes and hidden areas to explore, but with purposeful direction. Rarely these days can a game deliver a peak experience in a tight, focused package without unnecessary padding. The story, inspired by Pinocchio, is charmingly unique and walks a perfect line between mystery and emotion. Choices matter and deepen your investment in the journey. That said, the game isn’t flawless. In the latter stages, enemy designs are often reused, sometimes making encounters feel repetitive or dull. It can be disappointing to see an imposing boss earlier in the journey reappear later as a regular foe. Additionally, one or two of the more gimmicky bosses didn’t live up to the challenge or creativity of the rest. While narratively justified, these moments felt like missed opportunities for more engaging gameplay and broke the momentum at times. Gameplay-wise, it delivers crisp, challenging combat with phenomenal weapon variety, thanks especially to its unique blade-and-handle crafting system. Mixing and matching weapon parts kept my experience fresh, allowing for creativity and making every battle unique. For me, Lies of P is more than a game—it’s an unforgettable adventure that I’m genuinely happy I experienced. Despite these minor hiccups, I can wholeheartedly recommend Lies of P, even at full price. The journey it offers is truly worth every penny.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 21, 2025",9,Metacritic
Lies of P,1888160,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Achraf05,"The game is truly beautiful and stands as one of the best Souls-like experiences, very close to Bloodborne. The bosses are powerful and beautifully designed, and the world is exactly as it should be. There’s only one real issue: the shortcut system. At first, it was well done, but later on, the placement felt completely wrong. However, this doesn’t kill the fun at all, since the save points are perfectly distributed, making it not too bothersome. As for the story, it was good at first but became excellent with the addition.

That’s why I highly recommend it!️️
One more thing for those who say the game is extremely difficult: it’s a Souls-like, what did you expect? The game actually becomes relatively easier once you master perfect parries.

I'd describe it as a story-driven soulslike, thanks to its focus on narrative, the inclusion of multiple difficulty modes, and the fluidity of both gameplay and storytelling.Combat-wise, it holds its own against FromSoftware's best. The parry system, while challenging to master, offers incredibly satisfying feedback once you get the hang of it. It rewards precision and timing in a way that feels genuinely rewarding. The soundtrack deserves special praise—it's phenomenal. Every track complements the story and the atmospheric setting beautifully. That said, I would have liked to see more engaging and less linear level design. While the ambiance does a great job setting the tone, a more interconnected world could have added another layer of depth to **** area that could be improved is the pacing of difficulty. The game begins in a fairly approachable way, making it welcoming for newcomers, but later boss fights—despite their excellent design—feature abrupt difficulty spikes that might feel discouraging to those new to the genre.

The aesthetics are oppressive and beautiful. The slow methodical exploration and figuring out what to do is way more obtuse than Dark Souls but has a similar feeling of reward.  I'd argue that the mechanics are a little too obtuse and that as a result I didn't commit to any other playstyle rather than my starting one, but the sense of being lost in an aggressive dream-like world is very strong.  The combat for me was repetitive and sluggish and the bosses aren't the best I've seen.  For me the game shines in it's 3 main 'dungeons', and the genuinely scary 'run-backs' to base camp after killing the bosses.

Don't expect to want to play all the time but is a really good first-time playthrough and should last 6-10 hours. It is fun to revisit and is worth it if you're ok with not playing a ton.

The game is a bit of a maze if you just wander so use the visions or you might want to look up a quick playthrough.

The biomes are great and are designed so that you don't spend too much time in them so they don't get repetitive too quickly.

Everything that isn't a boss isn't as fun to fight though. Mechanics are fun but I try to avoid using the hardening ability to make it feel less choppy.

Dar alanlarda üzerine çok sayıda gönderilen düşmanlar bence oyunun ritmine ve hızına uygun olmamış.

Sertleşme muhabbeti ilginç. Kalkan gibi ama tekrar kullanmak için bir kaç saniye beklemek gerekiyor. Kabuk denilen cesetleri bulup artık o karakter olarak oynama fikri de ilginç olmuş.

Item'ları bir kez kullanmadan ne işe yaradığını bilemiyorsunuz. İlk kullanış genelde boşa gidiyor yani, beğenmedim. Bir de item'lıar belli bir sayıda kullanınca aşinalık kazanıp daha çok verim alıyorsunuz, iyi bir özellik.

Haritası bu kadar karmaşık bir oyun görmedim.  Bir de ana boss'ları kesip bir item alınca aynı yolu siste ve karanlıkta dönme fikri çok saçma olmuş.

A parte de todo lo anterior, no he jugado un souls más malo en mi vida, menos mal que me salió gratis. Parece sencillamente una demo (sin acabar) de un juego, los enemigos no cargan bien, el combate es monótono y aburrido, el parry no sirve de mucho, los objetos y cosas que salen en la pantallas de carga ni siquiera te sirven como consejo o para enterarte de algo, parece claramente que ni lo han testeado, tienes varias armas y no vas a pasar de la principal (la tengo al máximo y el resto todavía no puedo tenerlas ni a la mitad de nivel), las mejoras de los personajes no tienen sentido (porque no son mejoras; hay un ataque que si te conviertes en piedra en el aire haces mucho daño al caer, pero no puedes ni saltar ni caer por los sitios, ¿para que he gastado monedas y vestigios? todavía no he podido usar el ataque) y estas mejoras no se aplican bien (por ejemplo no hay otra oportunidad al matar muchísimos enemigos o no te curas al conseguir vestigios, aunque diga que aumenta la probabilidad de conseguir vestigios los enemigos no sueltan más, etc.), no he visto nada del tráiler en el juego, ni las velocidades de los personajes, ni las habilidades, ni nada de todo lo chulo que parece que promete y además de todo esto, es injusto y muy corto. Está sin pulir, con controles que en mando dejan bastante que desear, controles de cámara bastante malos, esquivas contra una pared que no sabes que está porque no ves a tu alrededor, hay muchos objetos que no son destruibles ni movibles y te entorpecen la batalla (como las tiendas) y muchísimo delay, no tiene nada de profundidad ni en el mapa ni en la historia (no sabes porqué haces nada, no tiene ningún sentido ni motivación detrás, ¿salvo el mero hecho de explorar?) ni con los enemigos (ni con nada), te lo puedes pasar prácticamente corriendo todo el rato y evitando un montón de peleas (son mejores las peleas contra boses que contra los enemigos normales, tienen más sentido). El tema de la familiaridad, que me parece algo innovador, queda totalmente opacado por el resto de cosas (lo pondría como algo ""bueno"", pero ni si quiera). Los vestigios se quedan en cada armadura (o shell) lo que genera que cuando te cambies de una a otra para mejorarlas, te lleves una desagradable sorpresa, además de obligarte a manejar una clase de personaje que igual no es tu estilo y te deja con clases/armaduras a medio mejorar. Para usar las ""habilidades"", necesitas determinación, que consigues al rellenar unas barras tipo stamina en los combates pegando enemigos.... pero si dejas de combatir y no has rellenado lo suficiente la barra, desaparece y se vacía (cosa que pasa bastante porque no quieres estar todo el rato peleando), las mejoras de las armas no puedes comprarlas, debes encontrarlas, pero tampoco sirven de mucho ya que consumen muchísima determinación (hasta el parry la consume, quitando un personaje, el resto casi no tienen barras de determinación y no es algo ampliable, encima esta es una de las cosas top que aparecen en el tráiler, pero it's a trap.) En consecuencia a todo esto, el precio base me parece una pasada y que los DLC sean de pago me parece todavía más basto. Hablando de esto último parece ser que han metido en el DLC una 5ª clase al estilo pay to win. No sé de donde habrán sacado nada para hacer el 2, pero espero que sea mucho mejor que esto. Un juego estilo souls no es un juego frustrante, desquiciante, austero o con mecánicas injustas o limitadas, son juegos que te ponen a prueba y con bastante dificultad pero te permiten mediante mecánicas a tu alcance poder probar diferente modos de combate y demás, pero este no lo hace. No sé si es que las nuevas generaciones se conforman con cualquier cosa mediocre (o con cualquier plagio, ya que intenta desesperadamente parecerse a Dark Souls), pero creo que deja bastante que desear. Como culmen de todo esto, además, tiene bugs... No se lo recomendaría ni a mi peor enemigo. Por sacarle algo bueno, los gráficos no están mal (y eso es gracias a UE4) y las canciones del laúd. No pretendo que esta crítica sea un ataque al juego, es simplemente mi experiencia con el mismo y lo que me ha transmitido (decepción).

More Like Labyrinthine Headache**I spent more time running around in circles than actually fighting enemies. The level layout is so confusing and poorly thought out that I constantly found myself ending up in the **same area I just came from**, only from a different angle — as if someone twisted a maze and forgot to label the exit. Some sections are so large and **completely empty** that I genuinely wondered if I glitched into unfinished areas. Zero enemies, zero atmosphere, just giant hallways for no reason.

No shortcuts, no reasonable respawn points — just a big ol' middle finger to your time and patience. **Item Descriptions? Nah, Figure It Out Yourself**You want to know what an item does? Too bad! *Mortal Shell* gives you **zero info** unless you use the item first — and once you waste it, well, that's just your loss. No forgiveness, no hints, just frustration. This isn't challenge; it's **bad design** dressed up as mystery.🪖 **Shells Are Cool… Until You Try Upgrading**The Shell system — where you can possess different fallen warriors with their own strengths and weaknesses — is actually a **great idea**. It gives you flexibility and encourages experimenting with different playstyles. Unfortunately, the **skill upgrades are mostly trash**.

It wouldnt be so bad if the boss fights were at least fun after the slog of going through the janky world. But no. Two of the four main bosses have about 3 moves only and the other 2 are gimmick fights.

Mortal Shell,1203620,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,KillerBunny,"This takes every mechanic from a soulsborne, and misunderstands them completely.

Leveling: you don't. There are no stats to speak of in this regard, or rather, you start ""level evened"" with your enemies and it stays that way. You'd think this is a good thing, but it absolutely is not.  You have ""shells"" (which you have to find). It's basically a class with extra steps, and you can't develop that class outside its bounds- like giving the no-stamina tank some stamina, or the no-HP rogue some HP.  They're stuck with those stats.

You purchase sidegrades for these shells, of which only half per shell actually relate to combat in any way, and three are universal between shells. Each shell has to have their tree unlocked *individually.*  ""oh that's not so bad!"" wrong. There's only four. If your playstyle doesn't fall into one of these four ideas the devs had for you, you're S.O.L. It also means that if you DO find one that's your playstyle, and you unlock the stuff you want, the EXP resource of the game becomes completely obsolete besides buying consumables.  There is no fear of death besides having to go back to the starting area of that zone.

Parrying: Parrying isn't a normal thing. It's attached to an item you have to locate. This item needs to be charged in segments, by dealing damage. If you don't, it doesn't work.  If you don't fill the segment, it decays.  Half the enemies in the game ignore parrying anyway, because ""they hit too hard"" or -surprise- it was actually a throw attack and you were supposed to I-frame it with a dodge. This leads to healing.

Healing: Awful.  Parrying when it's charged, and consumables you have to find in the wild.  No, they are not blood vials- blood vials you have a max you can carry and they actually work. In Mortal Shell, the consumables that heal worth anything tend to remove the resource that lets you parry. Yes, you read that right.  Healing, removes your ability to both parry & by extension, heal more.  By the way, that resource is also the resource used for special moves.  So if you ever have to heal, you can't use special attacks, because those attacks cost so much of the resource, and your healing just deleted that resource.

Weapons: There's only four weapons. Three of them are big beefy two-handers your character swings like they're just waking up. The only short weapon that swings ""fast"" is dual-wielded, and only does full damage if both weapons in the attack animation hit. This dual attack swing has the same overall attack speed as the big two handers with none of the range.  In addition, all the weapons seem to do the same general damage besides the one small fast weapon, for the reason I just listed (everything has to hit). It's literally just choosing what you want your attack combo to look like, and maybe some consideration to range.  Now, how about upgrades?

To unlock your special move, you have to locate a unique item for that weapon and upgrade it at the workbench or anvil.  You also *cannot switch weapons* without going back to the hub, which you cannot do regularly because there *is no fast travel.* The other alternative is finding a specific item related to that weapon, which is an item you have to ""use.""  However, these items tend to be hidden. That's right, they made weapon switching an item usage.  By the way, that goes for shells, too.

You can't just stop and switch your class outside the hub. You have to find a *consumable* item to switch your class out in the wild (no joke, these do NOT refresh on rest).  If you want to swap out before a boss, since there's no fast travel, you have to go *all the way back to the starting hub* or burn an item.  How bout travel, then?

There's no fast travel from point to point.  There is an infinite use item to go back to the start of the zone you're in and lose your important resource, glimpses, which don't drop on death anyway.  It's literally simpler to teleport by letting enemies kill you and respawning. If you have your shell's sidegrades unlocked, which is all glimpses do, you won't even care then.

Finally, enemies.  Half the ones had throws that'll eat huge chunks of HP, can't be parried, and are long-range lunges.  Some bosses have them and they ignore parrying AND blocking.  There's an abundance of snipers that always stun when they hit you, overlooking fight zones with heavy enemies that can two shot you.  There's multiple ambushes in every zone that are completely untelegraphed, and no way to trigger them early when you DO know about them. There's no dogs, but there's worse- poisonous suicide bomber frogs.  It's actually impossible to hit them due to how the combat animations work, their size, and when they explode.  You whiff high on every attack as they approach, and angled attacks are aimed where a torso would be, but they're on the ground.  Furthermore, they're in thin tunnels, so you just have to accept getting poisoned or burn a poison immunity.

Salt and Sanctuary,937010,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,dogukansapmz,"Giriş

Salt and Sanctuary; Ska Studio'nun yaptığı, oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvania yapımı. 2016 çıkış yapan bu yapım cidden bu 2 türü de kendi içinde çok iyi bir şekilde birleştirmiş. Sadece iki türü birleştirmekle kalmayıp aynı zamanda iki türün özelliklerini cidden aşırı üst seviyede yaparak başarısını ortaya koyuyor.

Oyunun Türkçe dil desteğine sahip olması da ayrı şekilde güzel.

Hikâye ve Atmosfer

Krallıklar arasında savaşın neredeyse patlak vereceği kaotik bir dönemde , ortam biraz sakinleşsin ve barış yapılsın diye iki krallık evlilik yapmaya karar veriyor. Biz de diğer krallığa prensesi götüren ekibin bir parçasıyız. Gemiyle yolculuğumuzu yaparken gemi saldırıya uğruyor ve saldırı sırasında gemi batıyor. Bu olaylar sırasında bir şekilde bayılan biz de uyandığımızda kendimizi bir kıyıda buluyoruz. Amacımız prensesi bulmak ve her neredeysek buradan çıkmak. Temel hikaye örgüsü bu. Aslında çok güzel bir dünya yaratılmış. Şu an spoiler olacağından anlatmıyorum ama çok güzel bir lore yaratılmış.

Hikaye anlatımı souls oyunlarının çoğunda olduğu gibi çevresel anlatım şeklinde ilerliyor. Yollarda ilerlerken gördüğüm şeyler , insanların anlattıkları falan bilmediğim olayları gün yüzüne çıkarıyor ve olaylara derinlik katıyor. Tabii ki de bu anlatım hikayenin çok büyük planda olduğu yapımlar kadar iyi olmasa da , aradığımız şeyi tamamiyle verdiğini düşünmekteyim. Oyunun iki sonu var. Ama bu olay gene her Souls oyununda olduğu gibi çok minik olayları yapıp yapmadığımıza göre değişen bir yapıda. Yani yapımı değil de varlığı tatmin edici son tarzlarından.

️Oynanış Mekanikleri️

Oyunun kontrolleri eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen oldukça akıcı ve genel oyun şeması kolay. Ama yeni başlayanlara çok yardımcı bir yapıda olduğunu söyleyemem. Bazı kendisine özgü mekanikleriyle Souls oyunlarından ayrılıyor ve bu durumun işimizi kolaylaştırmıyor. Oyunun genel zorluğu Souls oyunlarından biraz daha az olsa da kolay olduğu kesinlikle söylenemez. Hatta zor demek aşırıya kaçmaz.

Silah çeşitliliği oldukça fazla. Ama genel olarak belirli bir sınıfa kısıtlı kaldığımızdan ve skill tree de kullandığımız puanları yeniden düzenleme mekaniği olmadığından direk başka bir sınıfa geçme durumunuz olmuyor. Mekanikler klasik souls mekanikleri zaten. Stamina kontrolü , dodge , parry , hafif atak , ağır atak falan. Oyunda çoğu Souls oyununda olan mezhep mekaniği var. Bu mezhepler bu oyunda diğer souls oyunlarına göre çok daha önemli yer tutuyor. Çünkü direk sağladıkları kaynaklar senin oyun tarzını etkiliyor. Mesela rahip sınıf büyülerini sadece bir mezhep veriyor kalan hiçbir mezhep sana bu büyüleri sağlamıyor gibi gibi. Aynı zamanda bu mezheplerin getiridiği çok güzel bir mekanik var. Oyunda sandıklardan falan belirli totemler buluyoruz. Bulduğumuz bu totemleri bulduğumuz checkpoint'lere yerleştirerek o checkpoint'in içerisine farklı özelliklere sahip dükkan tarzı yerler açabiliyoruz ve bu totemleri koymamız aynı zamanda totem koyduğumuz bölgelerde bize ek özellikler kazandırıyor. Mesela keşif totemi bize farklı checkpoint'ler arasında fast travel imkanı sunarken aynı zamanda koyduğumuz bölgede mob'lardan düşen itemların düşme oranını arttırıyor.

Genel düşman ve boss yapay zekası oldukça kaliteli. Ama boss'ların kalitesi hakkında bunu söyleyebileceğimi sanmıyorum. Boyutu küçük boss'ların çoğu güzel fight'lar sağlarken boyutu büyük boss'ların çoğu genel mekaniksel kısıtlıklardan dolayı oldukça kolay boss'lara dönmüş. Bazı boss'lar ise zor olmasını sadece 1-2 bozuk harekete borçlu olduğundan bu konuda tam bir tutarlılık sağlanamamış. Zaten oyunda genel olarak boss'ların hasarının az olduğunu düşünüyorum. Ama aynı şekilde bazılarının belirli saldırıları var , bir kere vurduğunda kombo yapıp sana tek atabiliyor. Yani bu konuda minik sıkıntılar olduğunu söyleyebilirim.

️Grafik ve Sanat Tasarımı ️

Başta çok basit bir tasarıma sahip gibi görünse de aslında oldukça hoş bir yapısı var. Genel renk paletinin tercihinden dolayı zaten karanlık hava içimize işliyor. Çevre tasarımı da oldukça hoş. Her bölgenin birbirinden farklı yapısı oldukça belli oluyor. South Park misali karakter tasarımları insanı rahatsız edebilir cinsten ama ona da alışıyorsun. Animasyonların öyle aşırı mükemmel tarafları yok ; yeterli ve güzeller.

Sonuç ve Değerlendirme

Klasik mekaniklerin oyuna çok güzel entegre edilmiş olması
Mezhep mekaniği
Harita tasarımı
Düşman çeşitliliğinin fazla olması

Map'in olmaması
Bazı boss tasarımlarının basit kaçması

Oyun dünyasının ilk büyük çaplı souls-like metroidvaniası olan Salt and Sanctuary; bu türün ilki olmasına rağmen bazen nasıl bu kadar iyi olmasıyla insanı cidden şaşırtıyor. Her iki türün sevdalısını da kendisine çekebilecek bir yapım. Oyun beni o kadar içine çekti ki oynamaya başlamamın 3. gününün sabahı oyuna nokta koydum. Bayıldım.

All of the classes - even the Rogue - feel slow to control, this feels like a huge step-down from its competitors such as Hollow Knight.

Игры серии souls изначально по сути своей были переносом жанра метроидвания на рельсы 3D, очень уникальным и своеобразным но все же. Salt and sanctuary еще раз перевернула ситуацию, она перенесла dark souls на рельсы 2D. С самого начала игра дает понять на что она опирается и вообще этого не скрывает, скорее прямо заявляет, что вот мы - фанаты dark souls и сделали игру под копирку, так как ее обожаем. Изначально я скептически отнесся, но когда влился оказалось что это нереально круто, жанр метроидвания идеально сочетается с dark souls, как атмосферой, так и боевкой. Тут присутствует почти все элементы присущие souls - ковенанты, души, множество разного оружия и брони, боссы и т.д. Ты как будто реально играешь в dark souls но в 2D. Боссы очень простые, проходятся с 1-2 раз, последнего босса убил с первого раза, но возможно я собрался как имба, играл фулл хэви билдом с двуручником и щитом. Основная проблема игра - отсутствие карты, насколько вы можете знать - в дарск соулс карты нет, но дарк соулс это не метроидвания, а тут огромный 2д мир И БЕЗ КАРТЫ! Скорее всего большинство людей сошли бы с ума из-за отсутствия карты и дропнули игру еще на середине или даже раньше, но поскольку я топографический гигант, то я выдержал, люди не готовые перманентно держать карту в голове не перенесут такого напряжения.

The exploration element, skill gaining and backtracking - things that are defining metroivania works here more then well.

As for the combat itself, maybe it could be more ""complex"", but the difficulty is ramping up with few bosses. Overall it keeps the metroidvania's combat style and feel.

Salt and Sanctuary,937010,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,nervengas,"S&S is pretty much advertised as '2D Dark Souls', but it falls short of it's 3D inspiration on many accounts. The graphics are mediocre mid to upper flash game tier. Forget about feeling something like immersion in this game. The general theme of the background music, if present at all, alternates between repetitive and repetitive & annoying.
Weapon and armor balance is probably S&S's weakest part. Items are tiered from 1 to 5. High tier weapons are awkwardly placed and mostly useless filler - by the time you get to craft tier 3/4 stuff you can already access tier 5, making the former pointless. Lower tier weapons are simply not worth upgrading, unlike in dark souls. Lore consists of RPG boilerplate mediocrity sprinkled with the expected DS references - same for level design. It's not bad, but nothing really stands out as innovative or memorable either.
Combat.... sigh. It quickly becomes cheap and unrewarding - there is only so much you can do in this regard in a 2D engine. Total opposite to the original. There are enemies that pounce you or have some other lockdown (in some  cases instant kill) mechanic if you get close, enemies that have long range melee which you need to evade between attacks ( rinse and repeat) and various projectile attacks. The parrying system is a bit easier than in DS. High HP pools on the mob side combined with limited HP and few opportunities to attack on your side feel like something in between an attempt between a ramped up version of Dark Souls difficulty. Bosses basically require learning of patterns as well as their faster alternates which trigger once the 50% HP mark is reached, making for very drawn out fights. If that's your thing, or if you enjoy spending hours just getting through one boss pretty much every single time, this might be the one thing that will give you some enjoyment in this game. But if you think ornstein and smough or manus type fights felt least rewarding about DS, chances are you wont enjoy the boss fights in S&S because 'fast and aggressive' is the common theme here.
Blending out the copious boss fights there's actually pretty little content in the game.

Desearía que me gustara este juego, pero no va a ser posible. Salt and Sanctuary solo se ha dedicado a matarme injustamente y a robarme mis merecidas almas; pero el mayor pecado de SaS es, sin duda, el olvidar que SaS es otro juego, no un remake de Dark Souls en 2D.

Había jugado en el pasado un remake de DS para Spectrum, un pequeño juego hecho en coña parodiando el original. Ese remake para Spectrum, aún siendo una parodia hecha por un fan, aportó elementos en su jugabilidad que no se habían visto en el DS original, no muchos, pero algo nuevo metió.

Esto no lo ha hecho SaS, se ha olvidado de su propia identidad, y se ha limitado a calcarlo todo de DS, solo dejando sin copiar los elementos imposibles en un entorno 2D. Además, ha fallado al entender porqué DS funciona, lo que tampoco le ayudó a copiarlo bien.

Es una auténtica lástima, insisto, llevo siguiendo este juego durante años y lo he jugado ahora solo para llevarme un batacazo y una decepción, con todo lo que prometía.

Tal vez, no sé, los developers ahora hagan un DLC arreglando el juego básico y añadiendo más contenido, copiando lo que ocurrió con DS 2, pero algo me dice que no va a ser así, y que este juego llamado SaS que parece un prototipo, seguirá siendo un prototipo toda la eternidad.

Le studio Spiders aurait dû faire un jeu plus court et mettre les moyens pour travailler sur le moteur graphique..",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 17, 2024",7,Metacritic
Steelrising,1151340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,korzychxp,"Please do not be discouraged by the beginning of the game, as it is only difficult and looks unimpressive at the start. The storyline is also challenging initially, but later it becomes understandable with notes, videos, conversations – it’s well done. As a long-time fan of Spiders games (still waiting for Mars War Logs 2 and Technomancer 3!), I must add my opinion. Pros:

- Great music and atmosphere (the first time I see robots with souls). 
- Fun combat, though it gets a bit tedious after side missions with recycled locations (if you play just the main story, it remains consistently good). 
- Good graphics in most locations, mainly urban and underground; the worst is the beginning of the game and the bastille when walking by the river (but I play on low settings) – the river is awful, and what’s beneath it    
- Very interesting, though serious story, definitely has potential for development (despite the robotic elements, it’s emotional, and the historical thread picks up later)
- Huge selection of weapons, fewer outfits, but it's okay    Nice protagonist, relatable, has a cool voice   
- Nice storyline characters (though I discarded La Fayette)   
- Cool feature with the vestals where you buy things 
-  Also like the new options over time, such as breaking walls or the rope for climbing higher (though there could be more of this) 
-  Quite a variety of enemies, but towards the end, you know them too well and maybe four more would be needed  
-  Worth buying the Discus Chain DLC, as it can attack from a distance and interrupts many enemy attacks

Cons:  
-  Terrible optimization, on an RX6600 I have to play on nearly minimal settings, and still, the fps can drop from 80 to 30 in many places. Luckily, I like this game enough to grit my teeth; the worst are a few options including textures, which even on high can exceed 8GB VRAM usage, not to mention ultra, and they aren’t even hyper beautiful; the game also takes quite a long time to load on HDD 
-   Lack of newer FSR (1.1 looks ugly and helps little) etc.  
-  Lack of patches for the game, as if the developers abandoned it  
-  A downside is part of the combat where the enemy can attack even if we attacked them; that is, our attacks do not interrupt the enemy's attack animation, though sometimes they do (probably a paralysis issue); the best is to play with the chain as you can hit from a distance, avoiding enemy attacks 
-   Poor character development; I played as a dancer, focused only on strength, health, and stamina, the rest seemed unnecessary (unfortunately)    
- The first location is a downside as it puts many people off the game and they return it, as it’s not as carefully made; once you get through it, it’s great  
-  Zero game balance; I’m someone who kills the monsters on hand, destroys all crates, so I collect various items and have a lot of them 

And yes. The beginning of the game is as hard as Dark Souls, but you can level up and develop your character, so you manage (I play without assists). Then the game is moderately difficult and fun. However, at the end, I play with one hand. At the end of the game, I had around level 40, weapons upgraded to level 5, over 100 healing oils, 50 grenades, lots of HP. Just any boss I encounter takes maybe 10-15 attacks, throw a few grenades at him, add a special attack, and the boss is gone. And I have so many healing tools that there’s no fear of losing life. I just play the game without major emotions, unfortunately. I play only because I like the overall setting, atmosphere, but there’s no challenge.

And I play without assists, so I don’t understand people who need assists. Really only the beginning of the game is hard (indeed too hard). But then not anymore. Then you have various special attacks, the weapon has 2 attacks, you have fire, ice, and lightning attacks. There’s really a lot of it. Therefore, the game offers many development options, equipment, various attacks, it’s overwhelming at the beginning. But later, when you know how to use it, the game becomes very easy. Really very easy. With high endurance, you also easily dodge enemy attacks and don’t get tired, which is obviously a plus for people who don’t like Dark Souls, as there you have to be 10x more careful.

I would buy the game for up to 150 PLN if only it had good optimization, FSR/DLSS updates, and if the developers didn’t abandon it.

Of course, I hope for a Steelrising 2, but seeing that the developers don’t like sequels to their games, I probably won’t get my **** I also hope the game brought some financial success. Because it’s really not bad. The beginning of the game is off-putting, the story is not understood, the game is difficult to master, and the first boss is also very hard, the optimization is terrible, but if these were improved, it would really be a solid 8/10.",True,N/A,N/A,"May 22, 2024",9,Metacritic
Steelrising,1151340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Sepherim,"Steelrising es un soulslike que innova muy poco (alguna de las armas son algo originales, y puedes saltar y tienes algo más de movilidad que en otros juegos del género) pero ejecuta bien lo que se propone hacer. Para mi tiene una virtud innegable en su ambientación, ya que la Francia revolucionaria está desgraciadamente muy poco explorada en juegos o películas y es un periodo fascinante, incluso en esta versión fantástica. Caminar por las calles del París de la época, visitar palacios y lugares importantes como la Bastilla o Versalles, es genial. La historia en sí está bien pero tampoco es para tirar cohetes, pero sin duda está mejor contada que en cualquier Souls, cuenta con diálogos y decisiones que afectan al final de la historia, etc. Y el combate es ágil y fluido, con una personalización del personaje más simple que en un Souls pero que funciona decentemente bien. Gráficamente no pasará a la historia, especialmente algunas animaciones faciales flojean un poco, pero como ya dije la ambientación me fascina y está muy bien recreada, con lo que a nivel visual acaba resultando un juego distinto y bienvenido. Quizás algunas zonas se hacen demasiado parecidas entre sí. A nivel de sonido está todo lo bien que se puede esperar, tanto en efectos, como voces (me gusta que intercalen palabras en francés) como en el apartado musical.

Using [game save point] also respawns all enemies except for bosses. The game's main goal is to fight bosses and mini bosses, yada yada, nothing new here.
Steelrising drops the grimdark atmosphere in favor of an overly colorful 18th century France backdrop with robots(!). I prefer the dark fantasy which is why this one rates even lower than Thymesia for me. Graphics themselves are alright but nothing to write home about. Unfortunately the game is very poorly optimized so be prepared for a lot of stuttering - in a game that relies entirely on timing! Frame dips are frequent this is an absolute no-go. How these 10 out of 10 morons simply ignore this is beyond me.
The reason some reviewers seem to get overly excited about Steelrising's graphics probably is due to the fact that the big front runners FromSoft have delivered their games with the same outdated graphics engine from 2011 on and all other titles look next gen by comparison.
Steelrising also makes the mistake of putting a $50 price tag on this game. Sorry it's a C game lacking anyinnovation, worth $20 max! Definitely a wait for a deep deep sale and only if you are a die hard Souls fan and need to own every game in this ""genre"".

Sea of Thieves,1172620,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,jdmsjmsrscgm,"At its heart, Sea of Thieves revolves around the thrill of exploration and the hunt for treasure. Players set sail across a beautiful, open world filled with islands, shipwrecks, and hidden coves, all packed with treasures to be found. While on these voyages, you can encounter various threats, including rival players who may be looking to steal your loot, or AI-controlled enemies like skeleton crews that provide exciting combat **** shared-world nature of Sea of Thieves adds an unpredictable element to your journeys. You never know when you might cross paths with another crew, which can lead to tense standoffs or full-blown naval battles. The freedom to play either cooperatively or competitively keeps the gameplay dynamic, as your treasure hunts may end in epic victories or heartbreaking **** of the game's most thrilling aspects is the random encounters with legendary sea monsters. You might be peacefully sailing with a hold full of treasure when suddenly the waters turn dark, and the Kraken's tentacles emerge from the deep. Or you may hear the ominous growl of the Megalodon stalking your ship.
One of the standout features of Sea of Thieves is its highly detailed and enjoyable navigation system. Steering your ship is not just a matter of pointing in the right direction and hitting “go.” Instead, it involves a range of ship management tasks: raising and lowering sails, adjusting their angle to catch the wind, managing the anchor, and even patching up holes when your ship takes **** collaborative nature of managing a ship with a crew of friends makes this experience especially fun. Each crew member has a role, from helming the ship to navigating using the map, or managing the cannons during combat. The sense of teamwork needed to successfully sail and survive in the open world is one of the game’s most satisfying elements.While Sea of Thieves nails the navigation and exploration aspects, the combat system leaves much to be desired. Whether fighting other players or AI-controlled enemies, the melee and ranged combat can feel unsatisfying and overly simplistic. The melee combat, in particular, often devolves into repetitive and ""spamy"" exchanges where players simply mash attack buttons rather than using any sort of strategy or **** some players, the experience of sailing the high seas in Sea of Thieves can come with an unfortunate side effect: motion sickness. The game’s realistic ship movement, combined with the rolling waves and constant swaying, can cause dizziness or nausea for those prone to motion sickness. Spending extended periods navigating the ocean can exacerbate this, especially during storms or rough seas, when the ship’s motion becomes even more pronounced.",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 22, 2024",8,Metacritic

Rust,252490,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nonameinmind,"Rust was released to an “early access” stage in late 2013, debuting to a peak of 22,000 players in the release month. As of now, Rust has peaked at approximately 260,000 concurrent players in January of 2025, more than ten times increase. Rusts growth has been continuous, due to the “Force Wipe,” a concept that on the first Thursday of every month they release a big update, wiping everyone's progress, across all servers. Rust is from the development studio, “Facepunch,” responsible for games such as “Garry’s Mod,” a sandbox game where anything is possible, and “Chippy,” an arcade style game based on the mechanics of “Space Invaders.” Rust is a multiplayer survival game, comparable to the likes of “Ark Survival Evolved” and “Day Z,” both of which are also set in post-apocalyptic warfare filled maps. These types of games are immensely popular due to their sadistic nature, taking others hard-earned resources for your own gain. Rust has been one of the most consistent games i have ever played, every single month they release a noticeable update to change the meta of the game. This keeps the gameplay fresh, this in addition to the server “Wipes” makes sure that players will be able to play for the whole month without it starting to feel old. However, this makes Rust extremely addicting, and very impactful on social life.  Rust is based on a post-apocalyptic island, leaving the island radioactive. It is rumoured that the island which all players first interact with was infested with the likes of a cold war, the island was used as a testing ground for weapons and personnel to do as they will. This left it in a state of warfare and an idea of “every man for himself.” Rust is a difficult game to learn, and it takes a long time to learn the mechanics, let alone to gather enough knowledge to be able to take fights, at the right time, with the right weapons and with the right amount of people. In Rust you also must learn recoil patterns along with refining your aim to insure you will hit your shots, without learning you are bound to lose every fight you take. In Rust there is not a definitive end, you can always have more resources, raid more people, take more fights. That's the beauty of Rust, you can never actually “complete” the game, this is what keeps players consistent through the month, chasing a never-ending goal. Since you never actually can complete Rust there is no “replay”, however, there is a concept of server “Wipes”, where there is a set schedule and on the day specified everyone's progress gets reset, just for them to go back and get it all again, showing the true nature of Rust. Rust’s settings are vast and varied, however you cannot modify the game farther than they let you, since its multiplier they must discourage and punish third party programs, especially ones that aim to modify the games memory. Rust is available on Steam, PlayStation Store, and Microsoft Store on XBOX, bearing in mind Rust is not cross-platform since PC players would have an advantage. Rust usually sells for £34.99; this is on console stores and on steam. Rust hovers around a 40GB size, reasonable for the large amount of content. Rust pays a large amount of attention to the graphics, the greenery and the buildings all have intricate details to make them look as realistic as possible, and they do an excellent job at it, the interiors of the “monuments” are all rustic, adding to the feel of a post-apocalyptic island. Rust has a variety of sound effects and music cues, the gun sounds are somewhat realistic, although not the best, the music is commissioned especially for rust and gives an aurora of creepy, scary survival. Rust changes the sounds depending on the environment a player is in, for example in a cave, sounds reverb and appear louder and somewhat inaccurate, while above ground there is a distinct sound for everything and a direction of where it came from is recognizable. This is unique and enhances the player experience, really helps in a survival game. Rust usually does not experience many bugs, every update is meticulously tested before being pushed to the main branch, additionally they have a “staging” branch which allows players to play updates before they are officially released, allowing for user-reported bugs to be fixed and community feedback to be taken before a new update. Rust is a multiplayer game, the game requires an online aspect to actually be enjoyable, other players are out to get your resources and you have to protect them, no matter if you’re online or offline, which introduces a sense of urgency to get back to the game and play it for even longer. In conclusion, Rust is absolutely a game to try if you have not played it already, it has a certain player base who chase the adrenaline of losing and gaining resources throughout a period, making it intense and exciting. Although, I'd be careful about the addictiveness of it, it's no joke how many hours you can pour into this game without realising.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 10, 2025",8,Metacritic

Rust,252490,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DragonulX,"Rust Huh, the game that made my childhood better since I was watching the continuity creators on YouTube back when Zombies were on the map. I ended up playing with a friend for about 140 hours, most of which hours were done on empty servers or done by one of my friends using our monthly subscription initiated servers. Initially, I would have several reasons not to recommend the game, mainly because one of those main reasons is the overpriced price. But instead, I won't do this, because from my point of view, for how many hours I invested in the game and how I didn't feel them passing by me, being the game at the same time and very fun, I suppose they deserved their money. Starting with the worst phases of the game, as long as you don't play on a server made by you, you can't really put your soul into what you created or built on the game. In the game there is the wipe term, which at the choice of the owner who owns the server, can be: weekly, every two weeks, or every month) After this deadline, the whole map returns to its initial form from the beginning without any progress. The houses, your items in the inventory and everything you have mined or collected will disappear and you will basically get it from the beginning every time. It sounds very bad since most players of Survival games grew up with Minecraft, The Forest or Don't Starve, where in these games your progress was saved for the entire period of ownership. But it's not really like that, this only applies to servers officially listed on the server page of the game, if you want to create a server you can keep it for life without giving it a mandatory wipe but it will be unlisted and not you can set it as public, if you want it public you will have to comply with this requirement. It sounds decent so far, but there is another part to come. For you to be able to maintain a server is not as easy as in other games and especially since the game does not maintain the server created by you. Either you use Wireless Lan Party programs to invite others if you have a map and want it to run on your computer, or you have to buy a server domain which is not at all cheap unlike what I was used to do until now. These would be some disadvantages in what prevents its purchase if necessary. (You can have a public server with ""No Wipe"" only if there are no servers with Survival game mode. (example: PVP)In the rest, apart from these aspects, the game is ingenious, and comes to its base with a lot of new features and monthly or bi-monthly **** updates do not in any way damage the game or its image and even revive it every time something new appears because you always have something to do in it, especially if you are just starting out with the game and especially if you have a server with Wipe. The idea is that having a server with ""No Wipe"" you cannot expand your creativity as you want on it, most of the time you end up making a construction with the walls upgraded to the maximum and then you think that you have nothing left to do being that everything you did you did during the construction of the house. That's why Wipe exists, to evolve each player individually and all starting from the same point at the time of the Wipe. Imagine Hungar Games with Unlimited Respwn (that is if you don't play on Hardcore Mode) and with several players all evolving differently and attacking each other to capture territories and get materials from the battle or loots found on Map. The idea is very good and I wonder how since its launch it has not received an award or a congratulation for this complex idea, the basis of which is the community that continues to create and maintain active servers even today after a long time. I haven't really seen any bugs or glitches, the game is decent on the optimization side and the difficulty of the AI ​​in the game is to be congratulated. I recommend the game strictly if you have many friends with whom you can have a Party or Squad for Raids because otherwise it would sometimes seem boring to you and you would want to take a break with the game more and more often until you end up losing your interest completely, so that later to return to it again being a good game. On the music side, they tried to copy different ideas from other well-known Survivor games that have good music, and somehow they came out, but not how the developers expected it to come out. All in all, it's good, but it hasn't received updates with the music packet for a long time and I'd be impatient to see that. There are many things I could talk about when it comes to this game, but many of them end up having a positive impact on the game, which makes the final conclusion I recommend it with confidence, especially if you get it at a discount like - I also bought it by the way.

Rust,252490,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,EricReviews,"Created by Facepunch, a group known for games such as g-mod, comes Rust. This PvP survival game pits you against both the struggles of surviving on a stranded island with no escape, but also the threat of other people and NPCs. Rust differs from other games in this genre because of its vast plethora of mechanics alongside a seemingly simple premise: survival.  Rust has a reputation for being a very challenging, unforgiving game, but I believe this simply adds to the excitement. Although it might seem that after a short while, there may be nothing new to do, but the constant fear of losing all your progress to either another player or natural causes is what makes this game stand out, as there is no safety for your hard-earned resources when offline.  This does, however, cause many players to develop severe addictions, with many members of the community gaining hour counts into the thousands.  Rust is well known for its steep learning curve, with players being judged harshly by others based on their playtime alone. The gunplay in this game also is quite difficult, making players memorize recoil patterns for many different guns, and get used to the fast time to kill. Even with the short TTK, fights involving larger groups can last hours at a time, with neither side wanting to leave the battle after putting so much time and resources in.   Many servers also introduce prizes and incentives such as bounties for the most competitive clans to compete for. This leads to the formation of very large groups, sometimes with 40+ players, working together to win money on a regular basis. The nature of the game, however, means that to keep a bounty for long enough to be cashed out, the clans have to stay active on a single server for days at a time, often leading to many sleepless nights lying in wait for an attack.  The gameplay loop can vastly vary in length with some so called ‘wipes’ lasting anywhere from a couple days to over a month. However, even though it may seem repetitive, with little variation on the gameplay, each wipe has many different encounters with new people each time, leading to an enjoyable experience for as long as you make it enjoyable.  Rust is available on both console and PC, costing upwards of £20, and can be played on either keyboard and mouse or most standard modern controllers. However, the advantages offered by keyboard and mouse leads to problems in the console community with external devices such as zens.  Graphics/Attention to Detail and Environmental interaction/Scenery/Art Direction and Style Rust has a reasonably minimalistic art style, but this doesn’t detract from the game's positives.  The sound design for the game is both immersive and reliable, with most sounds being easily distinguished between. Rust can be very difficult to run on lower end devices, and can often crash alongside excruciating loading times, but there are very few noticeable bugs, and with the game being updated regularly none stay around for too long. One of the worst and best aspects of this game are the interactions with other players. While some can be kind or funny, most are extremely hostile, and the majority of encounters involve a stream of slurs through the microphone. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend this game to younger individuals as a lot of the language and threats used are quite nerve racking for less confident people.  Overall, the game itself has many strong features, but the community does slightly let it down at times.",False,N/A,N/A,"Oct 9, 2024",4,Metacritic

Troll players in a growing number of matches are using aim, invincibility, and other cheats, and nothing happens to them.  It's OBVIOUS.

Update: it's still absolutely terrible. Myself and literally all of my friends who used to play this game have quit because of the abysmal, unfair, toxic matchmaking. Good riddance. NetEase, sorry I won't be spending another penny on your awful game. 

Placement matches. Is it so hard to do NetEase? Guess not because 'something something something' money?

It is in fact similar to other games as far as the story / lore goes, but it’s not just killing demons (although it has a lot of that too !).

Dota 2,570,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,MorfenA,"Dota 2 is not just a game; it's an experience—a challenging, sometimes infuriating, but ultimately rewarding journey. For those unfamiliar, Dota 2 is a highly complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that demands strategy, skill, and ****’s be honest: Dota 2 is hard. The steep learning curve can make it feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers. The intricacies of the game mechanics, the vast pool of heroes, and the ever-changing meta can leave even seasoned players scratching their heads. It's not uncommon to feel frustrated, to the point where you might consider breaking your keyboard or mouse after a tough **** that's also what makes Dota 2 the perfect game. The intense emotions it evokes—from the highs of pulling off an incredible play to the lows of a devastating defeat—create memories that last a lifetime. Every game is different, every match a new story.Beyond the gameplay itself, Dota 2 has a way of bringing people together. Whether you're teaming up with old friends or meeting new ones from around the world, the bonds formed through shared victories (and defeats) are strong. Many players find themselves making lasting friendships through the **** conclusion, Dota 2 is a demanding but deeply fulfilling game. It challenges you, pushes you to your limits, but also rewards you with some of the most unforgettable gaming moments. If you're willing to invest the time and effort, you'll find that Dota 2 is not just a game—it's a community, a passion, and a source of endless joy (and maybe a bit of rage too).",True,N/A,N/A,"Sep 5, 2025",10,Metacritic

Dota 2,570,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,sakalipsa,"Throughout history, there have been numerous moments where discoveries embody the ""perfect formula"" principle, whether it's fire, the wheel, electricity, Coca-Cola... All of these discoveries or inventions are inherently part of a continuum of refinement driven by civilization's evolving needs through time and space. For example, Chess was played thousands of years ago with unlimited time per move, each piece had very different movement rules and overall rules differed significantly from modern ****, the ""perfect formula"" of Chess itself remains unchanged and will likely endure as long as our cognitive 'modus operandi' remains as it is. To put it more illustratively, these ""perfect formula"" discoveries and objects resonate with us much like corners resonate with spiders or trees and rivers resonate with beavers. Our minds are wired to engage with these perfect circuits in all their brilliance, because the human mind is a brilliant invention of evolutionary processes and this engagement is simply enjoyable wallowing in our own **** such perfect circuit, among many others in different fields, is Dota 2. This game is flawless in its **** course, you would make a logical mistake in qualitatively comparing Chess with the wheel, or fire with Coca-Cola, or electricity with Dota 2, or even Chess with Dota 2 - which is usually the case. Each of these phenomena holds its own utility field, and their disparate, incommensurable states should be considered within their own contexts and frameworks. Chess and Dota 2 may have superficial similarities, but they are fundamentally different, like ""original Cola"" VS ""DIY Fanta"" different, the only similarity might be the carbonated bubbles in both drinks, which metaphorically could resemble your mental engagement through all aspects of being tricky, witty, or cunning in strategizing and anticipating moves of your opponent in Chess, or timing your spells in Dota 2 either alone or in synergy with your... ****, yes, THE TEAM. Damn. This sounds like it's always the same team and holy f, it actually is. The game has SO MANY players and has been out there for so long that it has crystallized a distinct pattern of mentality, which could literally be captured by the term ""Team of Dota 2"" with its own hypostatized face. The community in this game deserves special attention; it is a phenomenon that needs a separate review. Actually, it deserves a psycho-pathological study. It's no joke. It's unlike anything I've encountered in any online game before and I'm not using now personal experience (or lack thereof) as a validating instrument for this opinion - it's an objective fact, especially in recent times where its collective mind has reached its peak form.Anyway, back to the game, some surrounding aspects: I've seen many people discredit it, saying things like, ""Damn, that game seems complex and time-consuming; I don't have the energy to invest in it."" Yet they proceed to play Sudoku or Chess 24/7, others invest time in watching bare-bottom TV shows, some work and provide for their families, others gamble, others read books, etc... Everyone is occupied with something, but the 'rational' fear of this game persists, as if it's a virus that will devour their life like nothing else already does. This perception is completely distorted and based on faulty assumptions. As I said, the game is perfect in its core, and that ""perfect formula"" allows you to enjoy it endlessly...HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you should sacrifice your personality, abandon your character and dreams just to immerse yourself in this sinkhole. I mean, if you're confused about your priorities and lack essential personal values, that's your own weakness and fault. It's not the game's fault if you're inclined to start compensating for that weakness with a dominance-at-all-costs attitude in the game - initially just trying to win every match, and later becoming hyper-toxic towards others. Would you blame a beer company for your careless driving while drunk, or a casino for losing enormous amounts of money?

If you are already individually dissociated and dissolved into the crystallized Dota 2 mentality, of course you would. Noob.

If you think you can just go FREE and grind for everything, you WILL SUFFER . The new player experience is realy bad. If you are interested in this game, play it for a while, and then when you get your first 75% platinum discount, make a choice. Either buy 4k platinum with a 75% discount to remove the nonsensical and annoying time-wasting grind for absolute necessities like weapon and warframe slots OR decide that you don't want to make this one-time purchase and leave the game. If you are willing to BUY the starting platinum, it will carry you through the whole game, ONLY THEN you can truly enjoy the experience of progress in this game. Just go read all the other negative reviews; they are all about ""hitting the wall"" and ""repetitive grind,"" which is all caused by the platinum grind that halts your progress; without it, the game is good; with it, you have to pay for the game to be good. Also, everything for real money (not platinum) is absurdly expensive. Everything is bundled up with stuff you do not want/need, like boosters, artificially making things expensive—for example, exclusive skins for 60€, etc. So if you are not rich, you won't get those even if you are grinding for platinum in-game. Lastly the company is woke, and the mods are ban happy. Don't even try to write anything negative or, god forbid, single slur to a griefer in your party; it WILL get you banned. So only play the game, and do NOT interact with anyone in the game; if you want to send a funny message to your friend, do it elsewhere and don't risk it. If you want to send a gift to your friend like platinum to start with, DONT, send them the money irl, otherwise, you will get banned.

Apex has many competitors which are generally any battle royale, however the main competitors it tends to be fighting is games like Fortnite, and call of duty. Apex has its difficulties, whilst having multiple game modes for players to play and enjoy, the game can get quite repetitive, and players can get bored or frustrated with the game over a period of time. Although the game is a multiplayer game so if you find some good friends to play with you can have endless fun. Apex is set on several mythical islands with one that is a giant ship flying high in the sky, and each island have lots of different POIs and lots of decorations such as huge creatures that look like dinosaurs and some players can even interact with and fight against to collect valuables in the game that will help the player later on in that game. The main aim of the game is to kill every other squad, trio, duo, or person and be the last remaining survivor and be pronounced the Apex champion, although to become a champion, the game has a skill-based matchmaking system, so based on your skill level of the game you will always get put against someone your skill level although sometimes it does have its faults, however there is always something new to learn such as new movement which can confuse your enemies however takes hours of practice to perfect. Apex is a battle royale based game so if you lose one match you can instantly go into a new one giving it constant replay ability and you can play until your hearts content. It is a somewhat modable game where you can access controls within the game files which allow you to set multiple movements to 1 key and set a timer for it which specifically helps in Apex as it helps players who are struggling with all the movement techniques do the with ease.

Apex legends is a free to play game however some long-time players would argue that buying certain skins in the game would highly benefit the player, but the game is free however what comes with this is that apex can be a very aesthetically pleasing game if played on a powerful enough device and high enough graphics, otherwise the game may look extremely basic, and you may suffer performance issues.

Since its launch, the game has managed to maintain an impressive relevance, not looking its age, thanks to regular updates and the introduction of new content. One of the main reasons for Apex Legends’ continued success is its competitive and accessible development. The game is structured in a way that is friendly to new players, with a gentle learning curve that allows newcomers to quickly adapt to the game’s mechanics. At the same time, the game offers enough strategic depth to keep veteran players challenged and engaged, with a constantly evolving meta and a variety of characters, each with unique abilities. EA has managed to find an effective formula to keep players engaged season after season. The introduction of new characters, game modes, seasonal events, and map updates keep the gameplay experience fresh and exciting. This constant stream of new features and improvements keeps players coming back regularly, avoiding the stagnation that can plague other games in the genre. Despite its success, it’s inevitable that some players have dropped out of the game over time. However, Apex Legends’ player base remains robust, with only a small portion of the original audience having left the game permanently.

Apex Legends,1172470,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LT_Gruber,"Great Battle Royale game with high tension.

When the Battle Royale genre came to market, I played a couple of them. After PUBG, which I found fun for a while, but eventually bored me, Apex Legends hit the scene and it was an amazing experience.

In Apex Legends, you start in a team (with friends or random people) and choose a character and class. Each class has its own starting layout and proficiencies and, depending on the play style, can really make the difference between winning or losing.

An epic cutscene plays in which you are dropped from a plane, and while descending, you can choose where on the map to land. On your drop, you can also see the spread out other players, so you can determine somewhat how close they are going to be. After landing, you can explore a giant map in search of new weapons, enemies and gear.

Every so often, the playable area gets smaller and running into other players will be more likely by the minute. The tension is great and with each passing second, the chance for victory or annihilation gets closer. In the end, the combat arena is not bigger than a living room in a house and the combat en tension rises to a whole new level. It is them or you.

Apex Legends looks great. The huge map, the forests, the water, character models and color pallet, it is beautiful to look at. For me, the way the game looks, really enhanced my experience and made me choose this game over other Battle Royale games in the genre.

In terms of sound, the game is also outstanding. The glorious battle music at the start, the ambient, threatening tracks when exploring the map, it is just great.

The overall atmosphere of the game feels like a whole crowd of fans and supporters is watching. It has some sort of “Super Bowl vibe” if that makes sense. Sure, players who have been eliminated can watch you struggle (or die) but most move on to another game, which makes sense. Still, Apex Legends has this appeal.

I really liked the overall setting of the game. The action, the constant alertness of your surroundings, finding cool stuff, the adrenaline rush combat when you turn around a corner and the enemy is standing there, and one time, I even won the match with my team and I felt like a God.

The game is, of course, most fun to play with friends and the coordination and teamwork is just great. You are playing a video game, but it feels like you are in the army.

My only personal problem with Battle Royale games like this, is that you find a lot of cool stuff, get one-shotted in the head, and the game is over. This has nothing to do with the game, it is just how it is played, but I always get a little bumped out over building up something cool and strong, and then lose it all in a second.

Overall, I think Apex Legends is a great game and I would recommend it to everyone.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jan 22, 2024",8,Metacritic

They just deal massive damage and have an endless health pool.

Drop rates are insanely low and will drop gear for all classes which makes getting any upgrade for your class very hard to come by. The only way to progress is to stock pile items and switch classes when you have enough good items for the other classes because you won't be finding upgrades for the class that you are playing.

Level ups feel worthless as STR, DEX, INT no longer provide major stat improvements. Skills no longer level up. The only character they seem to have balanced the game around is the Warrior, ever other class dies so quickly it's not funny.

Performance wise the game stutters a lot and floats between 40-50 FPS with a 2080 on medium.

I'm so tired of devs labelling their game dank souls because they are too lazy to balance their game and then to top it off throwing in instant death attacks to further ruin the game.

There is no cool gear or skills that you will find while playing. The players that look amazing bought their skins. Your character will always look like you are wearing a bag of potatoes.

But I do feel that I have to mention that first, due to the image the game has and how much that oversimplification has harmed the game's reputation.

This game honestly feels infinitely more balanced than OW foundationally. OW forces you to play certain team comps, on certain maps, with each character usually having a single viable playstyle with little room to budge. Paladins offers tons of playstyles for each character through options like talents, in-game store abilities (think MOBAs, not actual cash stores), and even a loadout system using deckbuilding to sway your characters skills to your playstyle, optimizing exactly how you play.

Overwatch is such a frustrating experience because of how thin its meta is and how you're forced into certain playstyles and comps. If you don't follow them, you're going to get steamrolled. If you play support or tank and don't have reliable teammates, you're going to get steamrolled since you can't manage enough to defend yourself. Paladins gives you the option to play your role and hold your own when you need.

This game is not an Overwatch clone, it is better. You have options, you're not limited in how you can play characters, and while you probably aren't going to win without solid teamwork, you can at least have more freedom to sway the game in your direction and keep yourself alive by fighting back.

playing this game on its fullest requires roughly an ammount of 180 euros if you want the full fleshed out experience, in a place where doing endgame activities requires a group of people (3 in total for dungeons, 6 for raids), thats rather hard to find in a community that on one side calls the experts elitists with massive egos and one the other views helping new players out a rather big waste of time.

Sabía que el vault existía, pero pensaba que habían metido en él cosas laterales, sidequests y demás, pero como han metido campañas enteras, lo que encuentras es un desastre a nivel narrativo que es muy difícil seguir, saber en qué orden hacer, etc. Una de las peores experiencias que he tenido como jugador nuevo en un juego.Y eso que, la parte de combate, las clases, las habilidades, las armas y demás, todo eso es divertido. Bueno, menos las secciones de plataformeo, que son un coñazo ortopédico y parece que les gustan mucho. Pero todo lo demás realmente es muy bueno, y los trozos que te dejan ver de la historia parece un mundo interesante, con buen worldbuilding e ideas chulas. Pero todo eso se pierde bajo la frustración de que la mayor parte de lo que puedes hacer con la parte gratuita del juego es en buena medida irrelevante, carente de razones reales para hacerlo porque no hay ni historia ni nada en muchas de las zonas, etc.Gráficamente el juego está muy bien, el sonido también lo está, y yo la verdad es que me he encontrado muy pocos bugs en las horas que le he metido. Con lo cual a nivel técnico cumple muy **** una lástima que sea este desastre injugable el resultado final, realmente me estaba gustando y estaba bastante decidido a comprarme las expansiones y eso hasta descubrir que en realidad aún con ellas me iba a perder multitud de contenido, historia y demás. Quizás cuando salga Destiny 3 valga la pena entrar, pero como jugador nuevo, la experiencia de entrar al 2 ahora es completamente terrible. Deberían aprender de cómo lo ha gestionado Warframe, que lleva mucho más tiempo de desarrollo, y aún así no priva a ningún jugador de experimentar toda la historia y sus cosas, y gratis además.

Destiny 2,1085660,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,ztokdo,"Despite a rough launch that led to a divebomb of negative reviews just about that, there's plenty of other things that really make you hate it.  
THE FINAL SHAPE LACKS REAL CHARACTER.   The villain is just annoying to see or even hear any wierd ramblings from.  The amazingly beautiful visuals and gunplay are so contrasting to story and overpowered ability spam.   The final shape is a mediocre offbeat soap opera.  The final shape is lucky that no other game is trying a first person live service looter shooter.    

Honestly Zavala, Ikora, and ghost are relatively annoying.  Did you realize that the story mentions some great apocalypse, then the FINAL SHAPE FEELS NOTHING LIKE THAT.  The missions are tedious and have several ""gotcha"" moments.  A lot of time I feel like I'm just waiting for some dialogue or something to just play out.

The best parts of Destiny's past have been the speaker, Cayde, Savathûn, and Ghaul.  All of the world and feeling of complete power that Savathûn had in the Witch Queen is just gone since then.

The ""end game"" still boils down to making the same dozen exotics work.  The grind to get perfect gear and eggballs is aweful. The most recent ""events"" are all based on FOMO and are horrible to play.   I hardly know anyone who could put in the hundreds of hours to complete the 25 lost sectors or 50 runs of onslaught.  The dev team has completely lost touch with their player base.  

Who wants 2 hour long actitives like the recent raid.  It's great for streamers and aweful for friendship.  People get bored repeating fights in a room with wave after wave of stuff spawning in.  The main way to die is to not memorize where things spawn in for their gotcha kills.  

It's going to be the same thing as usual.  Bungie literally gives Destiny expansions and all current FOMO items to all their streamers to keep them streaming it.  This is public knowledge.  In contrast, I keep running into people with 30-100 clears of dungeons and raids without the exotics or main loot.   It's absolutely repetitive to the point that you hate it and has only double downed on that.

If you feel like it's worth a playthrough of the story and not getting the main items of value that it's probably worth getting it for you.  If you are lonely and have nothing going on in life, it's a great opportunity to stay that way and that may be for you.   The final shape really didn't capture a gaming experience and is really hoping that you buy it for nostalgia of what once was a game.",False,N/A,N/A,"Jun 11, 2024",4,Metacritic

Destiny 2,1085660,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LT_Gruber,"Absolutely not the game for me personally.

I did not like Destiny 2. Although my reasons are entirely personal, I just could not get into it. I never liked service model games to start with, and Destiny 2 is no exception.

From the start, I could not care less about the main story of the game. There is a whole universe of lore, story, events, memorable characters etc., but for some reason, I could not give a flying ****. I created my character, finished the tutorial and already felt pointless and bored. Normally I would “educate” the reader of my reviews with a quick recap of the story or main goal, but in this case, I just cared too less.

I played some missions and quests but nothing felt like it mattered. I go to the location, kill stuff, complete the mission, earn my rewards and felt hollow inside afterwards. The thought of repeating this process until I grew to a certain level pained me, and when reaching level ten or so, I was done.

Graphicly, I think Destiny 2 is boring. It is blend, stale and flat. The worst environment with these graphics is the Central Hub location. Weapons and animations look well and polished enough, but the color pallet is just boring.

Sound wise, I think this is one of the worst I have played. Sound effects and music is so generic and dull, and distant enemies do almost not make any sound or grunts at all.

The controls and menus were horrendous and really hard to figure out and understand for me, and the sleek, SQL database design of it did not appeal to me.

Loot was absolutely pointless in my opinion. You get the same weapon or armor twenty million times, but with a different rarity or color. The stats meant nothing to me and I had no freaking clue wat was good and wat was bad. The numbers showed me that an item was way better than the previous one, but when equipping it, I did not notice any difference.

Destiny 2 has a certain “theme/skin/feel” that is the same as games like Anthem or Starfield (in hindsight). It is hard to explain, but revolves about the look of the inventory screens, stat screens, quest markers, etc. It is purely based on the menus and inventory management. For me, that was a problem, because Anthem was one of the worst games I ever played in terms of boredom.

The feeling of a freemium game in which you complete generic missions over and over and over again is just not for me. I constantly got the feeling that I could achieve nothing, unless I pulled out my wallet, although this is technically not the case.

Because the game is “Freemium”, you constantly get confronted with “deals”, “special offers”, “new store items”, and “best values” from the in game store. In the menu’s, at the start screen, at every interactable screen, it just felt like playing a online webstore in a browser. I understand it, because of its model, but I just don’t like microtransactions in games in general and, in hindsight, it is just better for me not to play this kind of games at all.

In conclusion, my own personal experience with Destiny 2 was very miserable. I hated every second of it and was bored out of my mind the second I even started the tutorial.

I personally would not recommend this game.",False,N/A,N/A,"Jan 11, 2024",0,Metacritic

A complete novice can get the drop on you, no matter how experienced you, are as a player. The weapons have real-world recoil and sound. You feel the tracers whiz past your head. My only disagreement with other reviews is that, the Commander is not the most important role. SQUAD LEADER is the most important, as you are on the front, in the trenches with your men, capturing points and painting targets for the Commander...while under fire. Also responsible for digging tunnels for spawning purposes. Without the SQUAD LEADERS, the Commanders have no drops. In my opinion, this is one of the hottest shooters to date.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,garethvk,"The trend in war based shooters of late is to literally take a blast from the past. Battlefield 1 looked at WW1 and Call of Duty returned to its WWII roots for the most recent game in the series. As such when Rising Storm 2: Vietnam was announced, it seemed like a good progression and one that holds a lot of potential for gamers. The previous game in the series focused on the Pacific Rim conflicts and focused on the conflict with Japan.
This time out the focus is Vietnam and players can opt to fight for either the Vietnamese or U.S. forces and they will also be able to select a class and loadout unique to each side before entering the fray.
The matches I took part in showed off the large and detailed maps which provided plenty of options to flank and enemy or attack from cover. Fields, towns, temples, and more were all an option and I had intense battles in a multi-level building, trenches, fields, and in a town. The weapons were varied but I opted mainly for an M-16 or AK-47 depending on which side I was assigned to. I did have a great opportunity early in the match to ride on a Helicopter and took my position manning one of the machine guns, which allowed us to strafe enemy targets as we traveled.
Our focus was a mix of taking and securing an objective and of course eliminating as many enemies as I could. Using a mix of grenades and rifle shots I was able to dispatch a few enemies but you could tell that there were some seasoned players online who used to the map to their advantage and were masters at striking without being seen.
I also experienced some people who were more than happy to call in a Napalm strike without any concern to the number of friendly troops in the target area. Naturally as you progress you will rank up and have more options for your character and loadouts.
The graphics of the game were solid but did seem a bit dated compared to other shooters. But this does a great job of giving a rough and battle-worn look to the game and not trying to make a blasted and remote area looked like an over-polished presentation.
If you are a fan of team-based online shooters and want some great action in the Vietnam setting; then Rising Storm 2: Vietnam just might be the game for you.

The guns are pretty amazing overall and they are extremely fun to use with some being even better than others. Visually is alright even with the retro thingy that is going for but still I wouldn't exactly say it's anything spectacular. what keeps it down for the most part in my eyes it's a lack of viriety in general whether it's the enemies, the environments, the textures etc. there is not much of any of that really. What annoyed me personally is the respawn system after death which is something similar to bioshock, I could explain why but I will just say that it just doesn't work for me.

Prodeus,1200570,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nmaa18,"Short review: I have three main issues. I noticed after 10 hours of playing that I had never died from an enemy, the difficulty is in finding the ores and the exploration/platforming more than the enemies themselves unlike in Doom where both are difficult. Secondly, I find that finding these ores is incredibly difficult, to the point where I often need to look online for their locations. Even getting the map doesn't help much, as it lacks clarity and is convoluted. The issue is that the store is an integral part of the game, and not getting ores holds you back gameplay-wise. Finally its a little bit repetitive, but I guess this is an inherent/vestigial trait of this sort of old school FPS-style game. Nevertheless, the game is still fun, and the sound design, style, and sfx are great and helps set Prodeus apart from the rest. Shooting feels great too. Finally I like the amount of content there is, and the community maps is a great feature that adds a creative aspect and more replay-ability. It's a simple, fun game to briefly play daily. 76/100.",True,N/A,N/A,"Mar 5, 2024",7,Metacritic

SUPERHOT,322500,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,camekanehir,"SUPERHOT stands out as an independent game offering a unique shooting experience. The game's distinctive feature is the manipulation of time, where time only progresses when the player moves. This grants the player the ability to slow down time when enemies are shooting or launching attacks.Graphics and Design:Graphically, SUPERHOT adopts a minimalist style. Enemies and the environment are highlighted with red accents on a white background. This design choice enhances the player's focus and strategic thinking.Gameplay:The game allows players to progress through challenging levels filled with formidable enemies. However, thanks to the time-slowing mechanic, players can carefully plan each move and foresee dangerous situations. This provides a different and thought-provoking experience compared to traditional first-person shooter games.Story:SUPERHOT's story transports players into a mysterious virtual reality world. As players attempt to complete a game within this world, they uncover secrets embedded within the game. The story keeps players engaged in an immersive narrative.Shortcomings:Some players might find the short story mode less satisfying, but this is compensated by additional content that enhances the game's replayability.Conclusion:SUPERHOT is a standout game with its unconventional gameplay, impressive design, and challenging levels. The time manipulation mechanic encourages tactical thinking, providing players with a unique shooting experience.

SUPERHOT,322500,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,APolChrome,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) Después de completar la campaña de SuperHot, puedo afirmar que no esperaba encontrarme con un videojuego tan bueno. Un juego simple pero complejo al mismo tiempo. Un juego que me ha sorprendido narrativamente. Un juego que tiene mucho contenido al terminarlo. Un shooter único en su especie vaya. Voy a empezar hablando del gameplay.SuperHot es un shooter que cuando no nos movemos, el tiempo transcurre muchísimo más lento (casi se para), permitiéndonos hacer auténticas virguerías con los enemigos (unos personajes rojos). Ya está. No tiene muchísimas mecánicas, no te atosiga con armas. No. Tú te inventas la forma de pasar los niveles. La cantidad de interacciones es única y es una gozada ver la repetición de un nivel en el que has hecho alguna fantasmada. Aunque el tiempo se pare bastante, se siente muy frenético y nos da una sensación de adrenalina muy **** variedad de armas que hay me ha sorprendido. Tanto que puedes usar hasta objetos del entorno (cosa que se hace muy divertida de ver) para lanzárselos a los enemigos. La mecánica que más me ha gustado ha sido la del HotSwitch. Consiste en que podemos cambiarnos el cuerpo con enemigos para transformarnos en ellos. Parece raro, pero a la hora de la verdad resulta increíble usarla. Ahora bien, esto se usa a partir de la segunda mitad, por lo que me parece que no se aprovecha todo lo que podría, pero el tiempo que se aprovecha, es un 10.Audiovisualmente, me ha gustado. Es un juego muy simple en este apartado, pero ser simple lo hace tan bien que acaba siendo muy bonito. Un estilo artístico muy limpio y unos sonidos muy buenos hacen de este juego una sorpresa en este aspecto.Y la historia me ha encantado. No porque tenga un guión elaboradísimo, sino por las sorpresas que da por el camino. La manera en la que la enfocan y cómo se va torciendo el juego me han fascinado, a parte de que tiene un transcurso muy natural y poco forzado. Aviso que os va a encantar.Resumiendo, SuperHot me ha gustado muchísimo. Es un juego único que creo que todos deberían darle una oportunidad al menos, porque no dejará indiferente a nadie. Un shooter como ninguno en una experiencia como ninguna. Recomendadísimo",True,N/A,N/A,"Jan 1, 2024",8,Metacritic

HOWEVER
the 20 hp that the players have is JUST NOT ENOUGH in my opinion. Why make expensive, decks (why buy or grind), when you can just go ""Noxus"" / ""anything else"" but i recommend ""Ionia"" to just go ""face aka. Nexus, and win in sometimes 3, usually 4-6, and at most 8 turns!? Ofc. you can go meta Heimerdinger/Vi or something similar, but again...WHATS THE POINT?!

Because of this kinda game breaking thing (easy to fix, yet still isn't: Nexus hp 20 -> 30) its VERY CHEESE, very EASY to dominate casual players and to grind up EVERYTHING in 2 weeks (inc. Bildgewater). So yea after 2 weeks i'm left with: ok, what now? NOTHING really. So w8 for next big updates / uninstall, that's it.

PS: If you play anything else, it will take you MONTHS to get everything. Some of my friends stopped playing it all together after 2 weeks because ""its too grindy"" / ""too slow to progress"". When I told them and showed them my method, they were like "" F OFF!!!"". Some came back and finished their grind in a few days, some swore to never touch this game again EVER!

In either case, you MIGHT have a solid 2 weeks of fun (by that i mean Strategically and tactically go ONLY Face/Nexus like a totally skilled player. Units live or die? Doesn't matter! Amount of cards in hand and/or deck? Doesn't matter! Mana cost/efficiency? Doesn't matter, only playing with cheap BS units and everything comes on curve 97.50% of the time! Leveling up Hero units? Doesnt matter, if it lives or dies! Strategy, positioning, synergy, tactics? DOESN'T F-ING MATTER!!! FACE FACE FAAAAACE like a total moron. Aaand it actually WORKS XD). Would usually rank it higher for that fact alone, that I had 2 weeks worth of fun, but we are talking about a company that has a lil. bit of che ching ($$$), so nope. League of Legends wanst made to last 2 weeks. I mean COME ON someone rewrite the 2 to a 3 (20 -> 30), if its mixed up! is it THAT HARD? Yes it is :)

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,NDiggy13,"Another pay to win card game in the same vein as Hearthstone and Gwent.  If you like Hearthstone but would rather play a card game set in the League of Legends universe then this game is worth checking out.  Be forewarned though, just as with Hearthstone, you'll either have to spend a lot of money up front or spend a copious amount of time playing the game over the coming months to be able to build a competitive deck.  Matchmaking is abysmal and deck balance doesn't exist.

The game seems generous at first with rewards, but you quickly learn that the rewards aren't the powerful cards you really need to compete.  And if you decide you do want to spend money, then I hope you have plenty of cash to burn because it will cost quite a bit to build a competitive deck or two with how the shop is structured.

Card balance and mana costs need a lot of tuning, which is surprising since I would have assumed they would have gotten this more balanced before going live.  Some champions are absolutely broken, Tryndemere springs to mind.  He's insanely powerful and once he's on the field it's a guaranteed win.  Doesn't require any set up or intricate card combinations to pull off, just play him and you win 95% of the time.   That's not well balanced, and that's just one example.

Stay away from this game unless you plan on spending a lot of money, or don't plan on having a competitive deck for several months, because it will take at least that long to build with the reward system currently in place.

Sea of Stars,1449850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Hackattaque,"Like Chained Echoes, Sea of Stars is a beautifully crafted throwback to the 90s RPG era, complete with all the quality of life improvements that we’d expect in the 2020s. No more random battles, painful level grinding and scattered save points; and as for the old-school ways of turn-based combat, it’s been given some clever twists, including a puzzle-lock system that gives you a chance to stop your opponent’s attack with the right spells.

Where Chained Echoes goes for a very elaborate and epic story full of plot twists, though, Sea of Stars goes for a more intimate and cozy tale of friendship and loyalty between three childhood friends who have a clear enemy to defeat. And whereas Chained Echoes had some fairly sprawling level environments, Sea of Stars has a more compact approach to dungeons, with tight puzzles to solve and pretty varied themes.

I would say overall I preferred Sea of Stars for its moment-to-moment gameplay and Chained Echoes for its story.

Overall, this game isn't just about warfare; it has within it intrigues, strategies, and some unpredictable plot twists just like in real life! You wouldn't be surprised to find out about why medieval people love to marry their kin and offspring off to some powerful duke or king. Even though it is sufficient enough to play it with the base game, I highly recommend the extension like ""Roads to Power"" and ""Tours and Tournaments,"" as it would add more varieties and more engaging content to the game.  

The game mechanic is quite good with a great UI; you can play as historical characters such as Kaiser Heinrich V of the HRE or King William the Conqueror (Duke of Normandy) or even the Mongols Borijin dynasty, and if you're up for something new, you can create your own character and rule the land you choose!  

For the mechanics, first let's begin with cultures. Cultures, of course, determine what we are like; If we are Mongols, then we are good at riding horses, and you can challenge your ruler for the throne or vice versa. While some cultures are more advanced, each culture shows different strengths and weaknesses. Next, the religions: there are also many religions unknown to me in this game, so I'd like to mainly talk about Christianity and what's unique about it; The pope will likely declare a crusade around 12th century, and you can either pledge to support it financially or militarily or both; the worst case scenario would be not to support it, as you'll lose piety and prestige. While participating could lead to a gain in prowess, prestige, and gold, you may have to take the risk of losing your knights or heirs in the battle. You can also create your own religion if you'd like to.  

Now, it's the characters time. So, if you choose some of the historical characters within the recommendation, then you will surely have a great stated character. The stats of a character comprise of prestige, diplomacy, intrigue, learning, stewardship, martial, and prowess: I guess the names already give hints of what they do. The higher the stat, the better your character will be at each task; high diplomacy means you can soothe other rulers and may be easier to make friends with them, etc. There is also an education mechanic where you can raise your child to have a certain personality upon their growth period (0-16 years). Choosing guardian can be a hard task, as you must choose according to the baby's traits such as the ""Charming"" should be studying diplomacy, and the guardian should have a great number of diplomacy stats, etc.  

To conclude, I do urge you to try this game out. It's got everything you'd expect. As an Asian, I don't think you should buy it full price, as lately, this game has been out on lots of discounts, so I do highly recommend you wait until the next promotional period.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,bskierys,"6/10 + 1 because of the perfectly executed couch coop.
Short: The game with great combat system, but generic setting and the plot that you don't really care about. I loved levelling up, and hated music and visual style.
Longer: What ""Divinity: Original Sin"" does very well is the combat system. Levelling up is slow and you rarely gain any new skill - and this was a great decision. After a while you perfectly understand every action you may take, its pros and cons. I played the whole game with my wife in a couch coop way and it was a great way to experience this game.
However, I was expecting more from an RPG when it comes to plot and atmosphere. When playing it, I felt like I was playing a hack&slash game with turn-based combat. The atmosphere is dull, generic and the dialogs are poorly written. We either skipped through them or was bored by them. The silly tone both in visuals and in dialogues was more annoying than entertaining.
We also hated the music that was so much anti-climatic. Especially that you have to listen to it over and over again during many many fights.
The quests were designed in clever way, presenting many ways of solving them, using the game elemental interactions. But beware the riddles. I usually love riddles in the games, but most of them in this game, are based on finding a correct object that you don't know that you are looking for.
Overall, it is a good game, but based on reviews I was expecting more. I was constantly comparing it to Pillars of Eternity, which I liked much more.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,NightGeisha,"One of the advantages of wait to buy this game is that now (2019) when bought it, I get two different experiences. I get the classic version and a enchanted version.
It may not seem significant, but it is. They are two distinct experiences of the same fantastic game.

I have not finished the game yet, because it is an immense and challenging game, but honestly I think I will not going to finish it for now, at least on this classic version of the game. Little more than 20 hours of playtrough in the classic version I think I have a good feeling of what the classic version have to offer and going to do the same with the enchanted...

But back to the game, it is simply incredible. Visually, mechanically. A pure role playing game experience, where the roots of the genre were transposed to the maximum.
Fighting for me is the most interesting and challenging element and it is necessary to use the head and the elements that surround us against the enemy.

It is a game of elements where fire, earth, water and air annihilate each other in a perfect circle. Its a game where an ""area of effect spell"" reaches not only the enemy but the ally in that area. And it's so perfectly done every single way, every moment on every fight.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,MeritCoba,"Captain Jack dropped us off at a beach instead off at the harbor of Cyseal as the town was besieged by orcs, mostly from the sea. The town, with its sizable harbor, apparently lacked a navy of sorts, which left it at the mercy of the orcish incursions. Well, not quite, for it did have an army called the legion, which would also have failed to defeat the orcs if it hadn't been for some magical crossbows the local hedge wizard had put together.

We didn't really mind to disembark as Jack seemed a bit too much like a pirate with his eyepatch, wooden leg and speech spiced with harrs and yarrs. In fact we were certain he was one as he knew the situation in Cyseal all too well.Since pirates prey on local shipping by hiding out in coastal waters, it stands to reason that they are perfectly aware of the comings and goings of ships and people in that harbor and the associated opportunities and dangers. Anyway, he was crash enough to tell us about the plight of the town only when we were about to reach it and proposed ditching us on a beach as if he was offering us a way out. We suspected that the only other option would have been walking the plank.

We were source hunters. Source was a thing that sourcerers used to power whatever needs powering. Actually we forgot the last part as we were stuck thinking about sourcerers/sorcerers thing. Somewhere a guy behind a screen in a universe far away thought this brilliant or hilarious and he was even able to convince some other guys in other rooms of that fact. It is indie and therefore it is excusable we were informed.

Somewhat further inland we ran into a dead guy. The note on his corpse informed us that some statues convinced him that he could fly. Apparently he took some time to write this down, either before or during his leap of faith. We suspected foul play as it was far more likely that he was killed and then the perpetrator took time to cover this up by planting this note on him.  It is that level of (N)CIS writing we are talking about. We found out later that nothing of the sort happened; he actually did write the note(!).  But at that point we actually didn't really care one way or another as we were not the law in those parts, in fact we soon found out.. nobody was.

After an encounter with a poetic shell(the only highlight) and some undead summoned by some guy which we dealt with by summoning stuff of our own, we encountered two drunk soldiers, then ran into a group of orcs headed by a mysterious man, which would have made mincemeat of us if  three sober soldiers had not taken care of them for us.

Finally we reached the town Cyseal which was noteworthy because of three things. The first were the dozens, nay hundreds, of barrels, chests, caskets, baskets filled with random content running from nothing to incredible powerful, if you happen to require stats improvements for two stats that are diametrically opposed. The second thing were quests that started someplace, continued at another place, without being clear how to go for one place to the other, and then earned you a trifle experience if you finished them. The last was that exiting the town on the other side too soon resulted in instant death as you need at least one or two levels and be equipped with some good stuff to beat even the three undead lurking on the outskirts. And once we did have that we found out that our gear deteriorated at such a rapid pace that we had to repair our gear every second battle.

Furthermore we ran into an imp called ZixZax who was the historian of all events in time, which was really funny, if we had been eight perhaps, a morai who had migrated out of the Greek legends(or a norn out of the Norse mythology) and dozens of more stuff stolen from history, mythology and stories that hailmark this game as superior uninspired as it comes to storytelling, which would not even be so bad if it just had added something original to it, like a twist instead of a silly play of words.
At this point we gave up and went to read a book or watch a movie or redo tombraider.

Original Sin is a LRPG. A looting role play game which is the wet dream for anyone who wants a nickname that spells micromanagement. You get to loot and loot some more and do that save-before-opening-the-random-chest-and-reload-if-it-doesn't-give-you-anything-worthwhile thing. The loot only marginally improves you scores as does the leveling. The whole thing is aimed at having you spend most of you time on deciding things like: should I use this dexterity +1 and strength +1 / + 10 % poison resistant sword or this speed +1 and intelligence +1 club with double durability? Only to find out  weapons either break two battles later or have become worthless after you progress one or two levels. But if you do not micromanage: prepare to die. A lot.

Apparently.. this is what what the people who kickstarted this game wanted.

If this game played like Dungeon Siege, it would have been awesome, but, it does not. The good graphics does not save this game. As a hero, you feel pretty weak and the characters are fragile compared to the enemies. The combat is painfully slow, it takes 10-15 minutes to fight 3 -6 skeletons! Your spells and abilities seem only to pinch the enemies and the enemies heal 2 turns worth of your attacks in one turn.

I prefer  GOT. But I did watch gameplay of this game and it interested me as I could create and play as my own **** world is so amazing, unique, wondrous and creative. Interesting to explore at **** Castle is the most interesting to explore. Everywhere else seems like a repetitive boring after thought and wasn't necessary and would of preferred if they put more focus and effort into making NPC's more interesting in dialogue, interactions and choices.Combat is done well even though it lacks enemy **** story is sort of ok.I do like exploring and trying to solve and complete things, but the puzzles and objectives are a bit too repetitive and rather dull. And there is too much of going back and forth as everything is gated behind skills that you get gradually. It took a long time trying to find all 95 Merlin trials and complete all challenges. I got all Revelio pages but it's so boring trying to find and complete the collection, so don't think I'll bother as it feels like a torturous waste of time.I don't like how you can only sell gear, you can't sell potions or materials. Even when you get your own shop. But even so I had so much money left even after buying all seeds, potion recipes and all the items you could for your room.Beast breeding is a bit disappointing the offspring doesn't grow up. All you can do is sell them to the beast shop. So no breeding different mounts or anything fun like that.I feel the game needs much better content. The conversations and narrative are boring, bland and weak. The game encourages you to converse with the professors  but what they say isn't interesting at all. I didn't find the characters interesting at all either. And it feels like the professors talk to you like you are a moron. It seems like this games speech is more catered towards young children than adults. It doesn't feel like a good open world game. It's an alright game. The game play doesn't feel very meaningful. I only kept playing as I am a bit OC about trying to complete a game and I will keep playing an alright game as long as I don't absolutely hate it.I didn't have any technical issues and only minor stuttering in some areas besides the  over bright lighting in treasure vaults making it impossible to see during the day which is an issue caused by a previous patch. This game is a bit too simplistic and seems it's made more for children.I like the castle, Hogwarts is enthralling and it's creatures. Riding around on a broom is fun and love when you finally get a beautiful hippogriff. Summoner's court was fun and it would of be nice if we could play it as much as we like.

Octopath Traveler II,1096530,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Tiwill,"Octopath Traveler II tells us that we don't need to be a superstar in order to bring hope to people. If you can make even just one person smile, you've accomplished something incredible and they will be a ray of happiness to you in return.

It conveys the idea that anyone can lose their way if they let their own pain taint their actions, and that it can be difficult to get out of that state of mind without a helping hand. Being patient with such a person in a time of need may blossom into a lifelong bond. Saving someone from their inner turmoils and giving them a chance to get back on their feet is a worthwhile endeavor.

It urges us to seek our own path, for we can never be truly free when adhering to someone else's expectations unwillingly. Sometimes, if your words fall on deaf ears, the only option left is to remove that person from your life.

It encourages us to be good to people, with no ulterior motive, and not to be insecure when challenged by misguided individuals who perform irrefutably malevolent deeds. If you let yourself be swayed by someone who acts with hatred, resentment or jealousy in their heart, you can quickly become just as lost as they are. It also reminds of the importance of patient critical thinking over immediate emotional response.

It even manages to tackle the topic of technological advancement and the need for wealth redistribution as new things get invented that improve the efficiency of production. After all, if knowledge exists to be shared with all, dough shouldn't just be hoarded either.

It is a tale about enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and spreading warmth and happiness around us.

This game is more than everything I had hoped for in a sequel to the first game. Much of the praise I had for that game also applies here, so I won't repeat all of the things Octopath Traveler II took from the first game that didn't need to be fixed, but let's dive into the ways in which it improves upon the original.

Improvements to the skills make it so there are much more ways to break enemies, and classes have been rebalanced in a way that feels like they all complement each other even better than before. The new Latent Power and EX Skills also make each character have a stronger identity in combat, and there is now a way to equip the same sub-class onto more than one character if you want to.

This series continues to have best-in-class music. As catchy as it is epic, as comforting as it is melancholic. Most of it is new, but a couple of melodies from the first game made a return in remixed fashion, striking a chord of nostalgia within me while strengthening the continuity of the series. It gave me the sentiment that these eight new travelers were experiencing emotions that the characters from the first game had also felt on their journey, despite having completely different stories. This is just one example of Team Asano's masterful understanding of emotion. Emotions are not unique; if it's a real emotion, then anyone can relate to it, because we are all human. Hearing those melodies again made me feel those intended emotions twice as strongly, as I thought of my past adventures in the continent of Orsterra as well as my current ones in Solistia.

Something I love about this series is how much the story feels like it ties into the gameplay and vice versa, and they went above and beyond this time to give us some jaw-dropping moments with the path actions at the end of each story. They somehow even managed to weave in the new day/night cycle mechanic into the plot.

The world is even more fun to explore due to the addition of boats and the way the map is less predictable to navigate. I think there are also more bosses to defeat, or at least they are spread out better. I still recommend equipping the Evasive Maneuvers scholar skill to reduce the encounter rate, making it just right as you explore. The chapters are also less formulaic this time around, making it so you don't know for sure what to expect from a given chapter. The post-game is much expanded as well, with some fully voiced side-quests that let you see what happened to some important characters in the story. Speaking of, the Japanese voice acting performances are absolutely fantastic and full of life.

The new cross paths really help tie everything together. And when I say everything ties together in the end, I mean it. Also, in the first game, a lot of the camaraderie between your party members came from your own imagination and roleplay. I'm glad that aspect is still present throughout the game, but there's a lot more jerky around the bone this time around, if you will. The final segment of the game made everyone feel even closer than I imagined my party in the first game to be, boosting the affection I have for these characters even more.

As the end approached, I didn't want to say goodbye. I'm grateful for this warm feeling... thank you for traveling with me.",True,N/A,N/A,"Apr 23, 2023",10,Metacritic

Nier Automata,524220,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Valeriaaaaa,"Personally, my expectation from an RPG game is definitely having combo mechanics in combat. In my opinion, this was one of the biggest shortcomings of Nier. When we look at other RPG games like Devil May Cry or Final Fantasy, we see that they do this very well. We experience combat at its peak with dozens of combo mechanics. Nier, on the other hand, only offers us 2 different attack options and doesn't really showcase the combo differences between weapons. For example, I didn't see much animation difference between swords. I don't know. Nier disappointed me in this regard, although the combat animations are quite nice. The second issue is the insufficient variety of enemies. I don't call the same robot with some metal scraps added on top and its level increased a different type of enemy. Another issue is the environment design; I really didn't expect it to be this weak. If you want to understand what I mean, just look at the Abandoned City map. That's all I have to say. This game, which has the potential to be much better and to enter the top 10 of the greatest RPG games, has been left in the lurch. It's sad that it is so little known even with 2B's influence. When I ask anyone around me, I hear that the only reason they play this game is 2B. It actually explains a lot...",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 15, 2024",7,Metacritic

I thought the story was amazing and because of the interactions I focused even more then I would whilst watching TV which made it even better. I really loved all the characters and found them all interesting. The game can be slow at times but even during them moments I never lost interest because the story still was moving forward at a good pace.

A couple of things that I didn't like was that the game was way to easy. I know it focusing on Story telling but still would have been nice if on the odd occasion something challenged you like QTEs (Quick time events) or some harder puzzles. A couple missions were kind of detective sort of thing but they were mostly self explanatory.
Another thing that was frustrating but not really an issue with the actual gameplay. For some reason when I 1st installed the game it kept crashing after completing chapter 1 and loading chapter 2. I tried verifying files (Xbox App) and that didn't fix the issue. When I reinstalled it was fine thou. Mite have been a corrupt file or something. It was saying something about a UE4 siren but no error code.
Another thing to note was that throughout the hole game I was getting random screen tearing during cutscenes. I tried messing about with video settings but nothing solved the problem. Apparently it is just an issue with the game. Its annoying thou cos the game has been out half a year and this should be fixed.

The main story itself is neither particularly innovative nor offers many surprises. Still, I liked the way the story was told and it makes you think about it even after you've finished. It changes from sad to happy situations without exaggerating them.

Unfortunately, there are hardly any decision-making options and if there are any, they have little effect, but that didn't bother me personally.

As usual in Life is Strange, you spend most of your time walking around, talking to other people and listening to monologues about things. The last one could have been shortened to a more bearable level for my taste. At least it gives you a bit more context sometimes.

If you don't like games like this, which focus very much on the story and offer hardly any gameplay, you won't be happy with True Colors.

The Walking Dead,207610,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,onyxian,"The Story

The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts brings you into an apocalyptic world where zombies roam the world. Throughout the game you play as Daryl Dixon, one of the main characters from the television show. In Survival Instincts, the story line gives general players and fans of The Walking Dead and insight look of how Daryl, and his brother Merle Dixon, met up with the main group and what they went through before that time occurred as well as show how Daryl achieved his ever-so famous crossbow.

The Graphics

Graphics quality in Survival Instincts somewhat lacks a dynamic punch, for example a walkers, otherwise known as a zombie, hair looks like it was made of glue or clay then molded onto the head. However, the diversity of each walkers face has it's own unique pattern of bite marks, scratches, shapes of the jaw, teeth and more, these all add to a good fright factor at the right moment of time e.g in a dark room, turning round and a walker attacks you out of no where. There are a great amount of bugs relating to graphics, such as broken fence pieces still floating midair, gates flashing black when opened, walkers floating when killed. All around missions have invisible walls, preventing you from going further away from the current map without any sort of police barricade, for example, taking away a bit of the realistic touch.

The Mechanics and sound

The AI is very sloppy, throughout gameplay I had opened a metal fence and the walkers still attacked the fence, paying no attention to me whatsoever, I then began to kill them one by one. When one walker died another took its place, as if they were lining up to die. The scavenging mechanics allow you to gather survivors and send them out to gather supplies, but the amount of survivors depends on the size of the car you currently have. That said, there are missions that allow you to find car keys to either bigger, or smaller, cars. When sending out survivors to scavenge for supplies, there is always a chance of getting them killed by walkers, depending on what item you give them to defend themselves with as each survivor has their own skill trait such as being good at using blunt weapons. There were countless sound bugs within this game, fences breaking with the sound of wood getting chopped, walkers dying with the sound of a metal fence breaking and more. The game includes a feature where the player can choose a method of travel such as highways, streets and backroads. Depending on what method you choose, one method can either consume less fuel or another method may take a road such as backroads where it consumes a lot of fuel with a high chance of breaking down. If, by chance, your car breaks down or runs out of fuel, a side mission will take place allowing you to scavenge the nearby area for fuel or car hose. The issue with the side missions is that they're very repetitive, as there are about 3-4 different areas.

The Gameplay

It felt a bit stiff trying to kill walkers, e.g using the sledgehammer was a lot quicker than normal. One thing that gives a good addition to gameplay is sneaking around, trying to sneak past walkers and stealth killing them by sneaking up from behind and executing the stealth kill action. Like any realistic movie or game, gun fire attracts walkers to your location so be sure to only use your gun in dire situations and ammo is scarce to watch out, you don't want to run out of ammo when you desperately need it. If you ever happen to get grabbed by a walker, it activates a grappling mechanic where the player must place the circle onto the walkers head, activate the attack trigger and stab them in the head. This method breaks fighting gameplay by 50% due to the fact after killing the walker that grabbed you, if there is another walker, it will grab you almost instantly after you let go of the previous walker, this allows you to kill over 15 walkers without using any ammo, losing any health and just drains the fun and realism out of the game entirely. On the last mission, near the very end the last thing you did is mount a military vehicles machine gun and kill any incoming zombies, after which it cuts to black screen and goes to the credits, without showing you how exactly Daryl and Merle met the group like the game was purposely made for.

Final Verdict

The game seems rushed, only to gain quick money. For the price of $49.99 or £31.99 makes the game a complete rip off, due to the lack of effort of the game. I feel the only reason others need to buy this game, is to play as Daryl Dixon and get to see Merle, even though he is barely in the game. A poor effort to a great series that could have become something incredible if more time was put into it.",False,N/A,N/A,"Sep 30, 2013",2,Metacritic

Not only does it have the most **** Mouse Acceleration, but the mouse aiming will just glitch out and start sticking on different parts of the screen.

Oxenfree,282140,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Simoss13,"Oxenfree delivers a thrilling experience which delves into the supernatural. You start as a teenager (Alex about 17) and she is accompanied by some friends to have a good time on a remote island. Things suddenly go pear shape as you awaken an ancient spirit that can possess and disorientates you and your friends.
The theme and interaction of characters is top notch, I am always wanting to know more about these characters lives and situations to lead them to being who and why they are. These spirits leech onto Alex's insecurities through the game and provoking unresolved issues.
At this point I should add the voice acting and character interaction is what really executed the plot and brought the game together as a whole. If it wasn't for voice acting and characters, I cannot see how this game would of panned out.
I really like thrillers that also develop characters and showing a 'coming of age' undertone. Movies such as 'IT' is a prime example of this. Although a different plot, it has that common theme. I scare easily so having an emotional personal plot really brings depth making it tolerable.
The art style and visual effects in the game are also breathtaking as it really immerse you in the games theme making me disorientated.
The major complaint I have on this game is the actual gameplay itself. It felt like a visual novel and walking sim, therefore the game play and skill is minimal. You have dialect choices constantly in the game which is great. I just wished they allowed me to select an option after a character has spoken, as the game seems to force me to choose and interrupt another characters dialogue. This can distract on the brilliant voice acting and plot which bothered me.
The game is priced well for a 4 hour adventure and if you want to see alternative endings (like me) you will give a second try to see how you choice matter in the end credits",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 4, 2021",8,Metacritic

A Short Hike,1044720,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Merse,"A Short Hike es una experiencia hermosa que le deseo a todo el mundo. Es un juego reconfortante, con un arte bellísimo y un estilo pixelado por defecto que lo hace entrañable. La música es otra de las grandes virtudes que hacen de este juego una obra maestra, fuera de Nintendo recuerdo pocos juegos con bandas sonoras tan maravillosas. El personaje que controlas en el juego es Claire, un pájaro que va a la isla de la que viene su familia con su tía para alejarse de la ciudad y pasar el verano. Al despertarse cuenta que está esperando una llamada y no llega, entonces su tía le dice que ahí no hay cobertura, que solo la hay en Hawk Peak, el pico más alto de la isla. Así, Claire se decide a hacer la ruta, y en el camino se encuentra con toda suerte de personajes con actividades e historias interesantes. Aficionados a la pesca, jugadores de una nueva especie de variedad de Volley cooperativo en la que siempre ganas, un atleta que achaca sus victorias a su vincha de la suerte y termina reconociendo que sus éxitos vienen de su trabajo y no de la suerte, un pintor que insiste en pintar cosas que no le convencen para complacer a otros hasta que decide pintar lo que le gusta de verdad, un escritor trabajando en el final de su novela, unos escaladores un tanto lamentables, etc. Al llegar arriba del todo, Claire contempla el espectacular escenario en el que hay una aurora boreal. Entonces recibe una llamada, la que tanto llevaba esperando: es su madre. Conocemos que se ha sometido a una operación, de la cual no avisó a Claire, y por eso ella tenía tantas ganas de recibir la llamada y hablar con su madre. Sabemos que todo está bien, también comenta su madre que Claire ya es mayor y pronto ya no la necesitará. “Nunca dejaré de necesitarte. Te quiero, mamá”, responde ella. Todo esto sucede mientras suena una melodía preciosa, posiblemente la mejor del juego, con lo que es imposible no emocionarse en este momento, que ya es una de las memorias más bonitas que guardo de un videojuego. Otro detalle remarcable es que tras llegar a la cima, un poco más abajo una escaladora te pide que le dejes 6 plumas para subir. Después puedes encontrarla arriba, te lo agradecerá y te devolverá las plumas. Es otro momento muy bonito. El control del juego también es fantástico, volar es muy satisfactorio.

It's incredibly intuitive in user interface design and combat mechanics. The soundtrack is cool, the visuals are okay, and the gameplay in general is addicting. But for me, that's when it ends.I absolutely have a certain bias against this game and I'll admit that. When i see reviews on Steam and Metacritic, i feel like people are praising this game just for the sake of it. They're mentioning these, very VERY basic structures and spices for any Rogue-like game entry. ""No two Balatro match is truly the same"", ""The game's deep mechanics deserves so much love"", as if those two things aren't always THE standard of a rogue-like game???Maybe my bias is; I'm a very seasoned Rogue-like player. Hades, Inscryption, Slay the Spire, Risk of Rain 2, Dead Cells etc. all of these games shaped up my expectation of a rogue-like entry. While I'm not taking away the fun that people are having with Balatro (I'm absolutely having fun with the game too!), i feel like these things that people give Balatro so much credit for, aren't anything but the genre's standard for me.This game is amazing, i won't deny that. It's a great value for anyone into the rogue-like genre, but i feel like the praises this game gets are a little overblown. Compared to Slay the Spire, and Inscryption, this game stands tall as a deck builer rogue-like with a fun & charming poker game aesthetic. Presentation-wise, Balatro isn't the most interesting thing out there, not even in my gaming library. However, an amazing game is an amazing game.

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel,1182480,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Revuc,"I have played MD until the end of December 2022. I would like to make it clear, that I am speaking from my own experience and as a player who went to Diamond 5 I want to give my opinion on the game.

Yes, it is true that the game is a good F2P, at first. Newcomers will receive a good amount of Gems and support to make a few decks of your choice, be it for casual or ranking. However, the Gems' income from playing the game alone becomes quickly inefficient. At the moment, I have stopped playing, you make 145 to 195 Gems from doing daily missions by playing in rankings or events, including logins and watching live duels. Those Gems are necessary to acquire cards. For 10 packs of 10 cards, you are guaranteed to received at least a SR, it cause 1000 Gems, plus if you have no UR the next 10 packs guarantee 1 UR. A F2P player can only acquire 1 bundle of 10 packs per week. It is true tournaments and events gives you more Gems through their own missions, but those aren't always available and you need those Gems to get those packs.

Speaking of packs, I would like to speak about the issue with them. MD announced a new selected pack with 4 new archetypes in it. So I kept my Gems from my missions, since I was interested. I accumulated over 4 000 gems. When the selected pack was released, I bought the bundle of 10 packs 4 times. The results I got was, 2 out of the 10 URs necessary to play this deck. The biggest issue I have is that they aren't doing a specific pack like they did with previous archetype on release date and even if they did, I still need to buy 10 packs or craft a SR or UR card of that specific archetype just to have access to that archetype pack and said pack will be only available for 24 hours, regardless if the client is down or not.

The material system of MD works as the following; you have a card you don't need, you have the option to destroy this card and create 10 materials equals to this card's rarity and quality. For example; if I destroy 1 UR non-foil I get 10 UR materials, if it was foil = 15 UR and rainbow foil = 30 UR. From those materials, you need 30 to create a card from the same rarity then those materials; so 30 UR to get 1 UR cards. Which mean, if I don't buy many random packs and get multiple URs and SRs I don't need I'll never get those more difficult URs to get. Also, I couldn't destroy more URs, because some of them are classified as Legacy, which you can't destroy even if you have extras of. Plus, it's not possible to try out a deck before using your resources on, the only exception is if they are available on Story Mode, but they restrict what you can play in the structure deck.

My biggest complaint in the gameplay is the absurd amount of time to play a turn. I had to wait 6 to 8 minutes to play my turn, or when my opponent takes 3 to 4 minutes to decide to play that  face-down Called by the Grave. I should not wait so, so, so long to play my turn and my cards. The turn should be restrict to five minutes or a penalty for inactivity of 20 to 30 seconds, punishing those who make the decks and immediately play them without taking the time to read their effects.

The ranking system is flawed. You can only climb the ranks. This is an issue, since you are stuck on the rank you have climb to and there's no penalty to lose multiple matches. Which mean, if you are at Platinum, but your deck isn't strong enough to defeat anyone, you are stuck at Platinum until the end of that season making duel experience miserable. The ranking should work around the experience of the players and not the amount of duels they have won in a row. Free to play isn't an option, since it is completely random and the only way for me to know the level of the opponent I'm getting in is through the brief description of the room.

As for those other ways to duels, with the exception to ranks and events, they are useless. You can't get Gems except those two modes. Unless you are playing with a friend in free duels, there's no need to play Free, Story or multiplayer if you want your daily Gems. Also, forget to surrender if you have to go and still manage to pull off the mission during your rank duel, because you need to either win or lose the duel to complete your mission.

Since decks can be difficult to make because of the limited resources, events are hard to complete since those are characteristic specific. Making your duels boring and difficult, since the other option, rent decks, are terrible.

Finally, I spent a large amount of money in the hopes to get more decks and further the ranks, however my attempt was futile since I buying so much gave me nothing in return. Not even enough to get the cards I wished to craft. If the situation was in real life, I would have at least have the possibility to sell the unwanted cards to get a bit of my money back.

Yes, this game is F2P, but don't do the same mistake I made. Don't spent for a possibility.

For me there are 2 obvious problems in this ""game"" that popped real quick :
1- the mentality of the players...
It is clear that many of them have nothing against those who play differently and remain fairplay.
However, the vast majority of comments I have read were at best disrespectful at worst insulting to anyone who didn't play like them, be it users of old decks, new ones or blockers.
2- Considering the glaring differences between the old fast decks and the new slow ones, there should be the possibility to choose between the 2 game's modes.

For me a good game is a game that gives everyone a chance to play in their own way, to find a playstyle that suit them, not a game that seems to offer several archetypes to finally just impose one or two.
Balance issues in PvP games are everywhere but this is the first time I see something like this or at least feel this way.

I dont care about wining or loosing, what i want is to have fun while playing/learning something that is new to me.
So now I have 3 choices :
- I stop,
- I build a floodgate deck since these meta decks really don't interest me,
- i forfeit everytime i end up against one of those decks (wich seeems a bit unrealistic since the vast majority is made of them).

O card game é e sempre será divertido, porém já faz tempo que a Konami não faz um game a altura.
Resumindo, para um jogo lançado em 2022, parece que tudo foi feito com pressa e apenas para cumprir tabela.
Não me leve a mal, mas toda a diversão que você vai ter nesse game é proveniente do próprio card game, e não do jogo ""MASTER DUEL"", que poderia fazer MUITO mais do que fez.
O modo solo é simplesmente esquecível.
Se você esperava alguma atenção para modos de jogo não competitivos, esqueça, o jogo simplesmente não te recompensa se você não buscar o competitivo.

E pior, o competitivo também é largado, com uma ranqueada sem novidades ou recompensas relevantes, eventos feitos esporadicamente e também sem um sistema de recompensa legal.

O jogo também te trava de várias formas claramente artificiais, pra não te dar recompensas. Exemplos: pacote de cartas legado (recompensa pelos duelos ranqueados), só te dão 2 cartas por pacote, além de dar cartas irrelevantes e que não podem virar recurso pra fazer novas cartas; gema pela subida de nível na ranqueada (uma das melhores formas de juntar gemas, mas, a cada nova season você não vai voltar da ranqueada do zero, isso pra te travar de obter recursos de subida de nível) e por ai vai.
No geral, você começa sendo bombardeado de recursos, mas depois o negócio simplesmente desanda de uma maneira que estraga a experiência, parece que o jogo não quer mais que você jogue.

Its less **** and more of Physics-Engine.

Are there any similar games or is it a sequel?

It's like Garys Mod or something along those lines. Its a not in its self but its a Physics Engine that allows the users to play any game that they want.

How is the gameplay?

As I said before, it gives options to allow users or players to play any game. Specifically any card, board or tabletop game. Tabletop Simulator comes with a few basic games but where the application truly excels is in the  Steam Workshop where there are thousands of games. It's a great way to try new games before spending $70-80.

How is the offline and online?

It includes both, I have yet to play online with other people but I have played locally and it works very well.

Is there any single player?

Of course, you can. You can download Mods that have single player. You can also create your own games. The nice thing is, its a great way to playtest a new game that you're working on.

Would I recommend it?

Absolutely, I keep trying to get my friends to get the game. We used to get together and play Tabletop games every Sunday but then one of my closest friends moved away. Now obviously don't get together to play tabletop games, I keep telling them that this is a fantastic alternative.

Griftlands,1942280,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,CompleteIdiot,"A good deck builder needs good variety. This is where Griftlands falls short, core gameplay is simply unsatisfying long term and gets stale too quickly. Slay the Spire or Monster Train are much more engaging in this element. The main thing Griftlands does get right is the story elements. The heists are and jobs are rather engaging and there is some variety that makes you want to do at least one more run. But once I had the perfect genocide and pacifist runs, I lost all interest in rerunning the game.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jul 3, 2021",7,Metacritic

Each playthrough takes between 2-4 hours (depending on how much side content you decide to do), and each of the 3 characters has easily 2-3 playthroughs worth of differentiated storyline to choose from. The game is well written and fun to play once you get the hang of it.

Theres a fairly steep learning curve; I don't think I would recommend the game for someone who hadn't played something more simplistic like Slay The Spire (not that the games are that similar, but if this is your first deck builder you may find yourself a bit lost early on).",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 19, 2021",9,Metacritic

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nove123,"What is this game is difficult to notice among many indie games, as it seems at first glance one figurative. But is it? Today I want to make a remark about what to look at it. Well, let's start with the visual, it's beautiful here, these words will be enough. And what about the gameplay has something to say. Firstly, he is strongly associated with music here and it is damn unusual in comparison with today's indie games. Secondly, its dynamism in some moments just rolls over, sometimes you don't even know where to hide in order to survive. The plot is here, but it is difficult to call it not childish, because it is built on friendship and mutual assistance. But in addition to the advantages in the game there are downsides, but rather they are connected with my preferences.
Firstly, the duration of the game is negligible, because it took me almost 2 hours to go through it. Secondly, there are too few music levels here, as they depend on the amount of music, but all music is not really them, therefore I see no reason to add so little music. And then there are some problems with complexity. Since it is at some points off scale, and in most cases average. If you warn us about the occurrence of epilepsy and you are aimed at a Danish audience, then why add casual mode, you'd better add a more complicated mode.
Summing up, I want to say, if you like the genre of dubstep music, electro and you want to have a nice evening, then this game is just born for you, since there is online and cooperative modes and answering the question: ""Is the game worth the money?"" I can answer: ""Yes worth it!"".",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 1, 2019",9,Metacritic

Unrailed,1116740,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,savvym,"Coop or competitive online game about making way for your railroads which you have to build fast. You control a character with basic movements and you only use two tools, one for wood and one for stone. Furthermore you can equip your train with extra wagons and improvements, such as dynamite producer, extra space, ghost wagons, jet pack and such.

GAMEPLAY 5/5
The game is divided by stages, so your goal in each one is to reach the final station by putting down the rails in front of your train. If you fail, the train will derail and game over. The players tend to block each other, even the terrain complicates movement. They can use predetermined icons for simple interactions.

GRAPHICS 3/5
Very simplistic, colorful and in later stage somehow confusing change of perspective. There are few models of character. There is a day and night cycle, during night each player has its own small light radius. Orientation and planning is important. The map moves slowly to the right towards the final station as the train moves, leaving the left side of the map covered but the player can wander off there. The main menu is nicely done controlled as if playing game itself.

REPLAY VALUE 5/5
The coop offers three difficulties and few modes. As you progress further, you have new fauna and flora, some is just annoying, some dangerous, some slows you down and some prevents you from advancement. You can collect some yellow things while running around. Each map is randomly generated seed.

MUSIC 5/5
It is soothing, little playful, good ambient sounds, not distracting from my objectives and nice at the same time.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
Non-gaming.

HOW DIFFICULT
Normal and Hard. Gets really nerving when your team does a lot of mistakes.

HOW LONG TO FINISH
Competitive mode lasts for few seconds, depending on the player skills and speed. Other mode can be endless.

VERDICT 9/10
Entertaining.

Original coop multiplayer with simple controls and limited maps. It is like Minecraft from a top-down view with objectives, the map keeps track of your distance so when the game is over, you will see a presentation of all your railroad through the map which is a satisfying look.

Nuclear Throne,242680,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DeaDMeme,"Nuclear Throne is a brilliant example of everything and anything that a top-down rogue-like shooter should strive to be and have. It's a game in which you play as one of many unique and different characters, each with their own special attributes and abilities and fight through all the enemies on any given floor. On each floor, you find new guns ammo and sometimes secrets.
Your objective is to get as far as you can floor after floor, kill after kill, bullet after bullet. It's a very simple concept a mite more simple than other games that try and do this like Enter the Gungeon or Risk of Rain as they are a little more mechanically intensive than nuclear throne while this causes a slight lack of mechanical depth this is more than made up for in the simplistic fun the game offers. Everything from just shooting a new gun to destroying the nuclear throne itself feels good. out of the massive library of guns, you'll find not one doesn't feel good to shoot with and use. That's not to say that there aren't any bad guns as there are certainly some that are worse than others and others which are better. Which brings me to the next point of game balance.
All of the game balance is done very well in terms of the player's arsenal as the way the game handles it is by giving the player some of the worse guns early on and holding the good stuff till later on, and when I say good stuff I mean Gatling rocket launchers and cluster nuke guns. While this is done very fairly, the game is a rogue-like and relies on replay-ability, while the guns early on are for the most part bad if you are lucky you could just come across a heavy crossbow and other weapons a cut above the cloth from the first level standard.
In terms of the game's aesthetics, the pixel art is both wacky cool and imaginative with funny and unique art for the enemies and bosses. On the other hand due to the simplistic gameplay and the simple geometry of the rooms gameplay can get repetitive for some but I find that to be a factor more dependant on the player than it is the game.
Overall I think nuclear throne is a fantastic example of what a good roguelike shooter should be like, fun gameplay fantastic replayability and an encouragement to keep playing to experience all the content.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jun 7, 2018",9,Metacritic

Enter the Gungeon,311690,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,maluigario,"TL;DR: Fun, hilarious, and cute. If you have had an iota of fun with a twin stick shooter or want to try one for the first time, GET THIS GAME.

DISCLAIMER: Got this game free on Epic Games.

I had seen this game from afar, never committed to buying it. I'd never even enjoyed a twin-stick shooter before. I don't think this has changed my opinion on the genre, but I LOVE this game.

Everything in this game is stylized to the max, with every enemy being a gun reference. The enemies are bullets that hold guns that shoot bullets, and your job is to shoot bullets at the bullets while dodging their bullets while not taking contact damage from the gun-weilding bullets. Sometimes your bullets are actually fish. Sometimes your gun has a mermaid tail. Sometimes it's a reference to a unique gun from some other media, like Halo or Hyper Light Drifter or Judge Dredd. And sometimes your gun is a bullet that shoots guns that shoots more bullets, so you can shoot guns full of bullets at the gun-weilding bullets.

The bosses are hysterically named and genuinely difficult to fight. There's a gorGUN, or AMMOconda or a king bullet **** on his flying throne of guns.

There is so much to unlock in this game. Besides your 4 starting characters, there are 4 more unlockable characters. There's an actual story in here worth digging for. There's like 4 different extra modifiers for different ways to play, like a Turbo mode that speeds everything up or a challenge mode that adds a random challenge to every room and boss.

The one and only beef I have with this game is that some of the quests you have to do to unlock everything can get a little tedious. And that's a small beef for something that a player not interested in unlocking EVERYTHING will not even endure. The fact that I could get some 40 hours of gameplay in what is essentially a roguelike with a small fixed number of floors before finding something tedious is a testament to how fun this game as a whole is. I've unlocked everything and I still play this regularly just for fun.",True,N/A,N/A,"Dec 5, 2022",10,Metacritic

Rogue Legacy 2,1145350,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Thyi,"Eu até iria dar uma nota 9 para o Rogue Legacy 2. Ele é um jogo incrível. Passei muito tempo jogando-o com bastante prazer. E até mesmo hoje ainda jogo as vezes. Porém, não dá pra ignorar certas coisas que optaram por fazer no jogo. Mas, apesar disso, continua sendo um ótimo jogo.

A primeira coisa, é que o RL 2 em muitos aspectos é basicamente uma cópia do RL 1, mas com melhorias estéticas e mais polimento. Eu não joguei o 1, então, para mim isso não fez a menor diferença. Mas com certeza pra quem jogou, isso pode ter sido um grande problema.
Outras coisas que me incomodaram bastante durante a gameplay, foram algumas escolhes de design do jogo. A esquiva colidir com os inimigos e causar dano ao jogador não me parece correto. Apesar de que eu me acostumei com isso depois, ainda acho que deveria ser uma esquiva que realmente esquiva dos ataques, como na maioria dos jogos. A Cellar Door também exagerou na quantidade de elementos que podem causar dano ao jogador. São várias armadilhas, elementos do cenário, excesso de projeteis inimigos que, inclusive, alguns atravessam paredes. Além dos próprios inimigos, é claro, que causam dano com ataques e ainda com seu próprio contato físico.
Sobre as classes e ataques em geral, eu acho que ficou bem esquisito os ataques de algumas classes em certas ocasiões. O bárbaro, por exemplo, quase não tem dano aéreo, pois seu ataque no ar é muito fraco e ruim de controlar. Isso faz com que acertar inimigos no ar seja um GRANDE empecilho. A falta de direcionar o ataque para a direção que você quer atrapalha muito algumas classes, como mago, boxeador, assassino. Aliás, a classe assassino é uma das piores, por além do seu dano ser baixo, é terrível no ar.
Felizmente, no geral os talentos das classes são bons, e mudam bastante a gameplay. Já as magias... simplesmente não se encaixam bem no jogo. A maioria são sem sentido e ruim de usar. Algumas são muito melhores que outras. O Tiro Calcinante é basicamente melhor que qualquer uma das magias para o mago. E pra classes baseadas em dano físico, com exceção de algumas, as magias são muito dispensáveis.
Sobre a variedade de cenários e inimigos, eu acredito que seja outro ponto negativo. Só há 6 biomas. O que é muito pouco mesmo para um roguelite, que é um jogo que iremos jogar por horas e horas. Comparando com o Dead Cells, lá tem diversos biomas, e você não irá passar por todos na mesma run. Eu sinto que nele os mapas são bem menos repetitivos. O que dá uma sobrevida ao jogo. Já no RL 2, fica muito maçante o começo no Castelo, e depois o mesmo percurso. Sempre com os mesmos 6 biomas. Pra piorar, os chefes só enfrentamos uma vez por ""finalização"". E com isso, eu quero dizer que mesmo que você jogue várias runs, o chefe que você matou já era, e só vai enfrentá-lo novamente após finalizar a história, e de novo só depois que finalizar novamente a história, e assim por diante. Isso torna o jogo ainda mais repetitivo e um pouco maçante. E os inimigos serem basicamente os mesmos em diferentes biomas, porém ""evoluídos"", não ajuda nem um pouco. Realmente faltou uma maior variedade de inimigos. Até tem inimigos exclusivos de cada bioma, mas são minoria. E no geral, realmente é o mesmo inimigo com um visual um pouco mais parrudo e com golpes melhores.

Sobre a narrativa do jogo, eu sinto que foi muito deixada de lado. Basicamente quase toda a história principal é contada através de anotações. Pouquíssimas interações com NPC durante a run (acho que dá pra contar nos dedos). E pra variar, isso deixa a run ainda mais repetitiva. Fazendo um paralelo com Dead Cells, ou Hades, nesses jogos você encontra NPCs em cada run. E desenvolve uma narrativa através deles. É algo bem mais fácil de entender, e mais interessante do que apenas ler uma anotação que torna uma história simples em algo confuso de entender. Ao menos os NPCs do lobby são muito carismáticos, e interagem bastante, com diversas falas. Esse padrão deveria acontecer durante a run. Agregaria bastante.

Por fim, as melhorias e itens do jogo. É triste que eu finalizei a história do jogo e não fiz uma build completa com as armaduras. Ou seja, com os buffs máximos do set. Por exemplo, o set do Protetor dá destreza no primeiro e segundo nível, e chance de crítico no terceiro. Após finalizar, é possível conseguir armaduras de nível mais alto, e algumas eu acho que só são possíveis de obter no NG+. O que é uma pena, porque uma coisa tão legal ficou basicamente de fora da principal parte do jogo. Sobre as melhorias, são bem bacanas. Porém, a chance de crítico só passa a ser usada muuuito depois. Não faz sentido. O crítico desse jogo é basicamente só o crítico de perícia, que acontece numa situação específica. Pois conseguir chance de crítico aleatório, é só com bastante tempo de jogo.",True,N/A,N/A,"May 10, 2023",9,Metacritic

Monster Train,1548850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Vulgrim,"I watched the game for a long time before buying it and saw its potential. Currently, it may not have a lot of possibilities, but as I mentioned - it has the potential for much more.
In my opinion, it is more fun to play than Slay the Spire, if only because of a more thoughtful system of improving cards (because we decide ourselves how we improve our creatures and spells) and the requirement of more frequent combinatorics. For me, an advantage (though probably not everyone likes it that much) is the lack of annoying RNG, which will quickly destroy our approach. We also have interesting multi modes and interestingly designed daily challenges. The soundtrack is also very nice.
Of course, as in any game of this type, we would like there to be even more cards, artifacts, enemies, etc. This is also the case, but I don't think the game will stop as it is.
In addition, I hope that in the future the creators will develop their game, which at the time of release seems to offer more than Slay the Spire after adding (years later) the fourth character.

Monster Train,1548850,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Mirrorminx,"This is the most content-rich deckbuilder rogue like game out there, and has a huge breadth of interesting mechanics, choices, and difficulty that make it stand apart from it's competitors. Many reviews compare this to Slay the Spire, which is a great, but straightforward game. This game has a LOT more varied mechanics, strategies, and deck styles, with five factions, units & spell based strategies. Cards can be individually customized with upgrades, and refining your deck is about much more than just trimming your deck down to a lean machine (which is the optimal strategy in most other deck builders). While some cards are niche, every unit and card has a place in an interesting strategy, and the starting faction (Hellhorned) barely scratches the surface of what lies beneath.

Don't buy this if you don't like deck builders: while it is mechanically very different from Slay the Spire, the deck and cards still form the backbone of how you play.

It's super rewarding because every run you unlock a few weapons, bonus, stages and/or characters.

The runs are quite fast (15-30min) so it's a great game for people not plenty of time.

Got it free this week, 11/28/24, on Epic games.  Gave it a shot and lost the next 3 hours of my life.  Its addictive.  There really isn't much to it, you just move around and try to dodge the monsters and build your character by buying skills with the stuff that drops off the massive amount of monsters you kill.  It is fun and addictive, but the downside of the game is it feels unrewarding.  You don't get any rewards for beating a run really except a few different templates to try and challenge yourself, like start off with +50 range and -50 dodge and you can only use 1 weapon, or something like that.  Its a fun game, but If I bought it, i'd be willing to pay a few dollars more to have some more features.

Hades II,1240440,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Valentin2227,"Après avoir découvert le premier Hades l’année dernier, Hades 2 était devenu automatiquement l’une de mes plus grosse attentes pour cette année et Hades 2 a clairement survolé et dépassé les attentes que j’avais autour de lui.


point positif

 - Bon commençons par le plus gros point fort de Hades 2 c’est sont système de combat, déjà que celui du premier était de très haut volé, celui de Hades 2 c’est tout simplement de l’art, j’ai rarement vu un système de combat aussi riche, profond, varié et maîtrisé dans ces mécaniques. J’ai beau avoir dépassé les 100h de jeu je trouve les combats toujours autant addictif et grisant, chaque run est vraiment différent à jouer en grande partie grâce a la multitude quasiment infini de build différents possibles ( armes de départ, bienfaits, carte de taro…).

- Il y’a beaucoup de nouveautés apportées par Hades 2 et elles sont quasiment toutes ultra kiffant que se soit l’ajout de la mécanique de magie, les cartes de taro, les infusions, les nouveaux dieux ou encore le fait d’avoir le choix entre 2 run différents au départ (enfer, surface)…

- Hades 2 vient aussi quasiment gommer l’un des défaut de Hades 1 qui pouvait devenir un peu répétitif notamment a cause du fait qui n’y avait ""que"" 4 régions et boss différents mais dans Hades 2 et l’ajout de la run à la surface avec ces régions et boss différents vient vraiment casser cette répétitiviter 

- Les nouvelles armes sont à la fois toutes ultra kiffant à manier mais aussi totalement différent dans leur manière de ce jouer.

- Tout les boss sont très stylé à affronter notamment grâce à leur musique et patern vraiment kiffant.

- Tout les musiques sont du miel pour les oreilles !!!!

- La DA du jeu est tout simplement somptueuse   


Point négatif

 - L’histoire est un peu moins bien écrite que dans Hades 1 , les dialogues et les personnages sont aussi un peu moins intéressants que ceux du première opus mais reste comme même cool à suivre

 - Tout les nouveautés de Hades 2 sont très cool sauf une : les épreuves du chaos que j’ai trouvé vraiment pas intéressante et sans intérêt 

- les boss finaux de Hades 2 sont très cool mais reste vraiment moins bien que celui de Hades 1 

Pour conclure Hades 2 est un jeu terriblement addictif, grisant et qui possède l’un des meilleurs système de combat que j’ai pu jouer. Hades 2 a parfaitement réussi à renouveler la formule initié par le premier opus en ajoutant plein de nouvelles mécanique. Hades 2 est tout simplement un très grand chef d’œuvre du jeux vidéo.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 27, 2025",9,Metacritic

I defeated Chronos for the first time! It took me like 20 hours to truly feel and grasp the game's combat mechanics, that is including my time to understand chronos' attack patterns. This game is simply **** presentation is otherworldy! The art style, animation, voice acting, soundtrack/sound design in general—this game grabs you into it's world and doesn't let go until you kill the Titan of **** course, in a Rogue-like dungeon-crawling game such as this one, the combat mechanics is what matters the most. This game's mechanics is incredibly deep. It has it's own sauces and quirks—it stands perfectly fine on it's own and when compared to the first game.Incredible game so far. Easy reccomendation to any fan of Hades 1, or any action Rogue-like enjoyer for that matter. You'll get your money's worth with this game. Hell, with this quality? you might feel like you're robbing the developers by not paying more—such is the experience of playing high quality Indie games.

[Post-game review]I fully finished the story campaign after 40+ hours! This game is wonderful—My perfect image of an action Rogue-like experience. Alongside Hades 1 itself as well as something like Dead Cells.I got no new inputs about the game honestly. The story is pretty good early and halfway through. I'm inclined to follow one of those people who aren't into the ending. The game's ending isn't bad of course, just badly executed.I actually don't care about the story. I know it's a weird thing to say about a Hades game—since it's one of the few reasons why Hades 1 was so beloved. But a story isn't what i look for in a game.What i look for in a game is; presentation like visual style, sound design, character designs, as well as the gameplay mechanics in general. Hades 2 delivers all of that with grace. And i for one, couldn't be more grateful.",True,N/A,N/A,"Oct 20, 2025",10,Metacritic

Cult of the Lamb,1205140,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,MimicTheShadows,"This game is severely underrated and very overlooked compared to many other top notch indie games.
Taking care of your cult is, while not all that complex, fun and provides some good downtime while preparing for your next crusade.
The combat is serviceable and does what it has too but it can get repetitive pretty fast. This was a lot worse in earlier versions of the game but has gotten better with the introduction of relics and heavy attacks. I’m sure the upcoming DLC will work to fix this major issue and if it does I’ll update this review,
Now if that was all I’d probably rate this game a 6 or a 7 but the big thing that really pulled me in was the lore.
The Story itself is fine. Most will not get much out of it other than a reason to kill the bosses and a means to an end, but a lot of the world building in this game is actually fantastic and has kept me intrigued for the last two years.
Now I want to avoid spoilers in this review so I won’t go into detail but I’m very excited for how the lore will get expanded upon in Woolhaven.

Cult of the Lamb,1205140,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nazrielau05,"This game's presentation is by far the spotlight here. The soundtrack is such a nice contrast to the rather violent visual effects this game has, that itself was already contrasted with the cartoonish/comicbook-ish art style. This combination creates an insanely well made package that sticks in my mind even compared to other games with the best of the best visual presentation.

The Rogue-like mechanics was implemented effectively here. With the inclusion of different weapons each run, different Tarot cards, and recently relics that i achieved. It's pretty much RNG-based mechanics like other Rogue-like games. The combat system feels nice as well, the rolling mechanics really forces the player to be patient and make a good position before making any move recklessly.

Another aspect of CotL is the Base building mechanics. Basically a simulator for a Cultist society. It's really fun! your death in the battle runs has consequences in the cult camp, it makes for a good balancing system for all the fighting sequences. It breaks the pacing nicely as well. Instead of one aspect of the mechanics over-taking the spotlight, these two sides of the same coin creates a shinny golden piece of currency.

For people who struggle with Souls-like games, I’m a bit on the fence about whether this one is for you. On one hand, I found a lot of the bosses easy, but difficulty definitely ramps up with the later bosses and some of the tougher enemies throughout the levels.

The biggest issue of this game is definitely the level layouts themselves. Most of them aren’t necessarily bad, but they are simplistic, meaning there wasn’t any that knocked it out the park or felt special. Later game areas frankly become a pain, especially when you combine the uninteresting level design with the game throwing annoying enemies groups at you. Exploration feels unfulfilling, and Item pickups aren’t exciting unless they’re from a chest, otherwise they’re mostly forgettable.

The game is surprisingly fluid. It has quick manoeuvrability and familiar gameplay that feels right at home if you’ve played a Souls game before. Sekiro-like deflecting is also here, which builds an invisible stagger meter and can even break your enemy’s weapon.

Mortal Shell,1203620,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Wiezzel,"I tried to play it on Computer, the movement with Keyboard and mouse is utterly garbage.
When you press A or D the camera AGRESSIVELLY turns and if you are FORCED to counter act with your mouse, many times it just ignore it and turns even more. It can quickly turn into a spiral camera turning around because the design is just plain trash and there is really no defense for how bad it is.
Since the camera is really the the gate to play the game and without visibility there is not much that can be done, this game deserves a 1.

I gave 1 extra for  the graphics. They seemed nice, not mind blowing, and lacking detail, but they fit in the environment ( that is poorly designed to fight in) it is really nice to only* walk around.

There is a mind blowing amount of unstoppable cut scenes that are garbage as well. Like after the tutorial, the character SLOWLY gets out of the water taking all the time of the world and you slowly walk forward and then they make you press E to enter a tunnel as cinematic animation like, where you then press W for like 3 min straights while you crawl through a quiet ugly dumb tunnel.
Just so the devs Ego can present you  ""Mortal Shell"" on the bottom black banner .... as if anything so far was impressive. Maybe for kids under 10 that do not know any better.

The tutorial is also made abnormally slow. Too many waste of times part.

Now that all and all you wasted 80% of your time the first 1h doing utterly nothing but staring and waiting and pressing 1 button at a time, you can start walking around fighting the camera automatic adjustment mainly. You will never get used to it, I uninstalled the game after another 30 min as it was mind blowing stupid how there is no setting to change that.

After all of this, there is some fighting. Fighting is VERY easy and you will just die early on for random things you are just not aware of ( there is no intro to new enemies ) you just going to die and repeat the last 10 min gameplay, Really a design around wasting your time, not giving fun.

The fighting itself is boring, very simple, not crazy or nice action.
Regular Dodge and slash and dodge and spamm slash and your enemy cant do anything or do the Hardened thing any time. I am really not a good player and never play soul like, but this was piss easy and I tried Dark souls 1 and I actually quit this one because it was hard not trash like Mortal shell.

Thymesia,1245430,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Young_Fawn,"A Solid Souls-Like Entry

Thymesia, for me, can be described as a strange combination of Bloodborne, Nioh and Sekiro.

Aesthetically it looks like Bloodborne and is about as fast paced.
Combat is a bit like Sekiro, with a strong emphasis on parrying, especially on boss fights, if you don't learn to Parry, the Bosses will put you down very quickly. It's also not hard to learn, a lot of complaints in reviews I see are people comparing it to Sekiro and then complaining about parrying? Hello?
The main Nioh aspect of it is the Plague Weapons which are a variety of different special attacks you can use and also the mission select, the game is not open world like Sekiro and Bloodborne, but level based.

The game manages to succeed in the way that all games should, it's simply very fun to play.
The enemy design is pretty basic but even the most bog standard guy can mess you up if you're not careful or you get too overzealous in your attacks.

One thing I liked is how each enemy has basically two health bars, armour and hp. You need to get the armour down so you can get access to the HP and use different attacks for each, if you spend too long dilly-dallying and not applying enough pressure, their armour bar begins to regenerate. I think it's pretty neat.

The side-quests are a must, yeah they're in the same level as you did before, similar to how Nioh's side-quests work, but you get a lot from them and some of the Bosses are strictly in Side-Quests only, so I'd highly recommend doing them, you also need their ""Cores"" for some of the different endings.

I didn't really have many problems with the game, I see people complaining about frame rate drops but I only had that for the first 10% of the first mission, it was absolutely not a consistent flaw.

Bosses are like how they are in most games of this genre, you get beat enough times to learn the attack patterns and then it just becomes about smashing them once you've got it down.

The story isn't told to you straight up, it's all done through passages and notes you find on the ground, which give you an idea of some of the history of the level and how things came to be. Again, not to keep referring to other reviews, but I don't understand why people are saying it's a comparable to Sekiro or Bloodborne and then complaining that the story isn't told to you in an obvious manner. Isn't that one of the reasons those former games were praised? Everything seems a bit hypocritical.

I guess my only complaint is that the game is quite short, you can probably finish the game in around 6-8 hours if you do all the side quests as well, but the game is only £20 so it's not that strong an argument.

I highly enjoyed my time playing Thymesia, maybe I'll go back and get some of the other endings, it was a good little experience and I really hope in a few years we'll see a sequel which is longer with a few extra mechanics added to the game. It's a solid entry into the genre and it is absolutely one of the betters ones on the market outside of Fromsoft games.

For what it is, it's a great game; something to keep you occupied for a day or two with a little bit of replayability but not a whole lot. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a game to scratch that souls-like itch which a lot of us have.

8/10, a great game for what it is and you'll have a lot of fun playing it.

Karakter ve silah gelişimi olsa da rpg elementleri çok az. Bir tane silahınız var. Ancak özel yeteneğiniz sayesinde düşmanlarınızın silahlarını bir defaya mahsus çalıp kullanabiliyorsunuz. Böylelikle ondan fazla silahı kullanmış oluyorsunuz. Bu da oyuna souls oyunlarında olmayan bir element eklemiş.

Bir diğer şey düşmanlarınıza vurduğunuzda canlarının azalması ancak pençe ile vurmadığınızda yaralarının iyileşip geri dolması. Bu yüzden normal saldırılarınızı yaptıktan kısa bir süre sonra bir kaç kez de pençe saldırısı yapmanız gerekiyor. Bu da yavaş ve defansif değil agresif oynamak zorunda olmanız demek. Ki oyunun oynanışı da bunu destekliyor. Epey hızlı bir karakterimiz var. Ne kadar hızlı olduğumuzu oyunun son boss'u olarak kendimiz gibi birisi karşımıza çıktığında anlıyoruz. Beni bir kaç saat uğraştırdı açıkçası.

Oyun atmosferi ve görselliği güzel. Müzik yok gibi bir şey. Harita dizaynı fena değil. Bir bölüme sondaki boss'u kesip gidiyorsunuz. Ama o bölümde keşfedecek küçük yerler falan var. Üst katlar vesaire. Öyle dümdüz koridorda ilerlemiyorsunuz.

Ben parry yapabildiğimiz yelpazeye benzer şeyi kullandım. Element hasarı veren, uzun menzilli olan silahlar da vardı ama bu oyun çok hızlı olması nedeniyle parry yapmak keyifli olur gibi geldi. Karakterimi de ona göre dancer sınıfından seçtim zaten.

Oyunun ortalarına kadar çeşitlilik iyi gidiyordu aslında. Yeni düşman çeşitleri geliyor, yeni yetenekler geliyor, kullanmasam da yeni silahlar ediniyordum. Ama ortalardan sonra özellikle yeni düşman çeşidi gelmemeye başladı. Boss'lar farklıydı bir tek. Ancak onların da çok kolay olduğunu söylemem gerek. Çoğunu tek denemede geçtim. Böyle soulslike oyun mu olur? Boss'lar hiç agresif değiller. Çok az vuruyorlar, genelde mal gibi vuruşlarınızı yiyip duruyorlar. Boss savaşlarını hiç beğenmedim. Bir önceki souls oyunum Thymesia'nın fersah fersah gerisinde bu anlamda.

Yan görevler falan da vardı ama oyun çok sarmadığı için uğraşmadım. Hatta son 2 bölümü etraftaki düşmanlarla hiç uğraşmadan direkt boss'lara koşarak geçtim.

I would add another issue:  this game for me crashed quite a bit in the later game locations.))  REVIEW:   This game is hard to review. I love Action RPGs, and this studio's last title, Greedfall, was alright and had some interesting ideas, particularly with the setting and basic story. And that might be Steelrising's best aspect- the setting is a really nice looking revolution era France instead of the typical dark fantasy of similar games. The combat and builds are alright, but had all the flow of Dark Souls 2 (and even has the two-tiers for healing items). This was good for me, as that is the only Dark Souls game I've managed to finish so far. Still, it's really rough around the edges, and the side missions were mostly bland and were piled on at a certain point before the late game rather than more evenly placed throughout (or they would be available but you couldn't advance them until you advanced the main game when it returns to that location anyway).

Lost Ark,1599340,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Sanastusa,"Demons are invading your world of Arkesia. Cities and settlements being destroyed and countless deaths. They are searching for hidden relics of the past called Arks. Arks are the only thing with the power to defeat the darkness and bring balance to Arkesia. Hired as a bodyguard for a group of treasure hunters, you stumble your way into fate’s hands. Are you the hero who can find the lost arks?
A free-to-play massively multiplayer online action role playing game (MMOARPG) that released in the east in 2019. Through a partnership with developers and Amazon, a western release was put into the works and came out last month with a huge success.
To start because it will be brought up to anyone who talks about Lost Ark. If it's free-to-play, does that mean it's pay-to-win? In short, Yes. If you are the type of gamer who wants to just throw your credit card on a game to rush to the end content, you can do that. But that will not take away the enjoyment **** for others who choose to play without dropping loads of cash.
With the build up to the launch of Lost Ark, I ignored the hype because I didn’t think it would interest me. Knowing most free to play games offer a little enjoyment but quickly fall off for other games. The day of launch I watched a couple streamers play the game and after a couple hours of background watching I figured I would tip the toe into the water…not knowing I would be **** in and loving every minute.
I describe Lost Ark as a melting pot. It takes game themes from across the field and implements them in a great way all into one game. The story is good and captivating through Arkesia. Big cinematic events happening through the quest lines of different lands. The world is beautiful and a treat to explore by land or sea.
In combat you will easily be swarmed by monsters and feel the legion breathing down your neck but your skill set of flashy (anime-esque/diablo) moves will make you feel like an unstoppable badass. Blood and gore splattering across the detailed environments while you collect your loot.
You want Monster Hunter? They have Guardian Raids. Solo or a party of 4 can take on a variety of difficult guardians that limit normal functions in the game. Limited amount of revives/items while also adding in a time constraint to push your team. Too many mistakes with accidental deaths and it’s a failure.
Do you want challenging content? Abyssal dungeons/raids that focus more on a boss's mechanics than standing around swinging a sword aimlessly. For example the second dungeon has a necromancer and if you fail to collect the correct orbs, he will revive and receive an increase to his abilities making the fighter harder and harder. Kill him all you want, but if you can't communicate or understand a fight, you won’t survive.
You want to make multiple characters because of all the neat classes? Lost Ark is extremely alt friendly. Separate from character level there is an accumulated roster level for your account. Most rewards will be gained on one character but forever shared with your roster. It's even designed for alternate characters to do daily or basic activities to funnel materials to your main character for vertical progression of gear.
You want to fight other players? It has PVP combat that is designed to equalize gear and abilities when you enter into the arena. To balance players on a similar battlefield giving anyone a fighting chance.
On the other spectrum of horizontal content, there is an abundance. Varies collection systems with separate reward tracks to keep any completionist busy. A card system that captures the feeling of opening random packs in a real life trading card game. I get side tracked more with horizontal systems. I forget I need to improve my gear and advance through the story. It's rare for a game to nail that to such a degree.
The game isn't perfect by any definition. It has small flaws depending on the type of gamer you see yourself as. If racing to the end game is your cup of tea it will be a long process because upgrading your gear is a grind. Coming into the game new with no understanding of the systems is overwhelming. These systems came out slowly in Korea over the games development and with the western release we received them all at once. A little bit of reading or youtube videos can help give you the fundamentals of how the systems work.
For what the game has delivered, I am hooked. I'm close to reaching over 200 hours with the game only being out for a little over a month. I'm in for the long haul and excited to see more classes and cosmetics to be released into the game. I still have story quests to work through and the collections are keeping me itching to find the next hidden seed of Arkesia.

Dota 2,570,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,LT_Gruber,"Great game, but too hard and chaotic for me.

I liked Dota 2. It’s mechanics, variation and tension is a unique concept and I enjoyed it very much. I especially liked it’s balance.

In Dota 2, two teams, each up to 10 players, battle it out on a map. Their goal is to destroy the “Ancient” of the other team. This is a large, bulky structure. Each team can choose their own unique hero, 4 skills and choose if they want to play a support character or an attack character.

The attack character specializes in damage and destruction, while the support character focusses on healing, buffs and utilizations. At the start of each match, a little time is given to the players in the team to discuss tactics.

Along the way to the enemy base, various monsters spawn on the road. This monsters do not attack until you do first. They drop currency, which a player can use to buy items in the various little shops around the map. There are also some boss monsters, which drop special items, some of which can increase damage, allow a resurrection and much more.

The graphics in Dota 2 are nice and colorful. The environments on the maps are detailed and full of life and although simple, it has a certain charm. The only problem for me with the graphics, are the various effects of magic, explosions, hits, elemental attacks that blast in your screen during heavy combat, making me lose overview of the situation sometimes.

The sound and ambient music is great and adds to the experience. When **** hits the fan, it can be a little chaotic, but overall, nothing to complain here.

The mechanics, menu’s and action bars are a little confusing and need some time to get used to. The learning curve is a little steep here, and some training matches are certainly recommended. The way the game is supposed to be played (with the right tactics that is), takes even longer and in the beginning, many noob mistakes will be made. Certain items are used in the wrong moment, certain skills have been used too early, that kind of stuff.

Like mentioned, the best part of Dota 2, is its balance. Every player has equal chance of winning. If a player is stronger than you, or kills you with two hits, it is probably because they risked their lives while getting some unique items from monsters on the road. The magic attacks drain mana, which recharges over time. This way, the game prevents spamming the same attack multiple times, keeping it fair.

I liked Dota 2 and it’s mechanics a lot better than League of Legends. There is more balanced gameplay, more tactics (in my opinion) and, because you play in teams, there is more coordination and teamwork.

The only problem, and reason, I stopped playing, is (once again) my lack of skill with this kinds of games. I do like them, and surely want to try them out, however, this kind of intense, fast and “professional” games are not for some hours of relaxation. So in the end, I just cherished the few happy memories I had with this game and moved on.

In terms of gameplay, mechanics and overall feel however, I would certainly recommend this game.",True,N/A,N/A,"Jan 12, 2024",8,Metacritic

Now Dota 2 is no longer Dota. All competitive factors are lost and its greatness is lost due to greed. Small example; player HUD used to be same size for all heroes, now it changes from hero to hero covering more or less screen space thus making it unequal.

Path of Exile,238960,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,CnPx98,"1, if not the best ARPG around today. And it's free, with no P2W Micro-transactions. Path of Exile (POE) is such an awesome experience that is difficult to pull yourself away from, after getting hooked. Every last detail has been thought out. Even those smallest quality of life improvements, that normally get glossed over, have been solved in a way that make the user experience better. Then all of these little improvements together, just make the game feel so natural and smooth to play. 
So the best part of ARPGs is the character building freedom, and that is where POE really stands out from the croud. The developers at Grinding Gear Games have really made every single style feel like the possibilties are endless. This has came at the cost of the new player experience feeling overwhelming. So if you are new, I recommend copying someone else's build for your first character. This will allow you to become familier with the massive skill tree before tackling your own build.
Campaign wise the game is fairly sized. How ever I personally never took much interest in the story and lore. But the gameplay is so good that it didn't bother me that I didn't have a clue what was going on. I have heard from fans that the story is really good if you bother to learn it. But my ADHD doesn't allow me to listen to a voice over the top of a text dump for each part of the game narration. Its like Audible but your looking at a screen with nothing intersting going on.
The enemy and boss mechanics are the best you can experience in ARPGs. With enemy attacks being well telegraphed. At times can be quite fast paced. With all sorts of flashing effects that gives you that sweet, sweet dopamine. 
The looting is also fun. Something that Diablo hasn't been able to quite capture since D2. POE makes you feel like no time is ever wasted. The currencies in this game are items to which do various things. Like change item modifiers or gem slots. So even items you don't want can be exchanged to NPCs for some of these currencies. Making everything carry atleast some form of value to the player. Rather then having 1 universal currency, that you end up getting so much of that it ends worthless. 
There is a player trading system. Most people tend to want Chromatic Orbs for items. These orbs changing the colour of gem slots on items. Gem slots are what grant you your abilities which you use in combat.

POE being free. Whats its monitization like? The only thing that you can buy that alters gameplay is stash tabs. These cost around $5 each. There is a variety of different kinds. Other then a currency tab (Allowing you to stack each currency, way higher), you don't really need any of the others, but they are nice to have. You could easily play through the game and get the full experience without dropping a dime. But I personally recommend spending around $20 on a few stash tabs so you don't spend as much time micromanaging your bank.

My 1 gripe with this game. ADD LEG ARMOUR!! All the characters walk around almost half naked. You do get full armour later in the game. But for hours you will be walking around in near enough your underwear, from the waist down. You can get cosmetic overrides, thou. Changing how each slot appears, regardless of what you have equipped. These are on the prices side, I think each bundle is like $30 or something. They do have discount sales on for a selection of stuff. It's more there if you want to show extra support to the team and get a little something in return. It's not ever rammed in your face. Throughout your hole time with the game, you will never get ads pop up asking you to spend money. Only a small button saying ""shop"" which clearly states that it is a microtransaction shop. So you know, this is where you spend real money. 

POE is proof that you don't need malicious or deceptive techniques to be a successful FTP game. You just need to make the experience enjoyable and the money will come. That when developers do these annoying FOMO techniques, that it is out of greed and not because ""They need to or the game will die"". 

If you enjoy ARPGs with fun looting and unlimited character builds then POE is definitely a game for you. And its free so definitely give it a go! The new player experience does have a bit of a learning curve, but I highly recommend sitting through it because once you start getting hooked, you won't regret it.",True,N/A,N/A,"Aug 13, 2024",9,Metacritic

After trying for a few days, I’ve had enough. My previous comments were already polite, but now I have to tell it like it is. First of all, not only does the game completely fail to responsibly teach the mechanics, but the company behind it is utterly **** entire game is designed to work against the player. The map mods always target the players’ weaknesses (and they dare to call this a sense of achievement—it's an insult to the players!). There's a 10% experience penalty, only five portals, and the skill tree, which seems expansive at first glance, is a total lie. Skill Gems? Whether they're usable or not entirely depends on the developers’ whims!This garbage game is as repulsive as Blizzard. With a company like this, I seriously doubt that their upcoming PoE2 will be good game.

Overall, the game cannot be considered poor; however, it is undeniably frustrating and infuriating.First, the game features a highly complex system. Unfortunately, many explanations of the game mechanics are provided through player-created websites, such as those detailing skill trees and equipment crafting, rather than being offered directly by the developers. The developers should have provided instructional resources to guide players on crafting equipment and understanding skill trees and their combinations. Instead, the official game website remains unchanged and simplistic, while the game’s mechanics continue to grow increasingly complex. Consequently, only players with an in-depth understanding of the game’s mechanics and calculations are able to excel, leaving newcomers at a loss, forced to rely on **** game’s content is inherently challenging, and with experience penalties upon character death and limitations on late-game map access. new players have no choice but to depend on player-created websites for game information. Unfortunately, these sites often lack the latest updates and sometimes contain outdated information. For an internationally promoted game, the language barrier further exacerbates the issue, making it even more difficult for new and returning players to access comprehensive game information and mechanics. These are aspects that the game developers should have addressed, but they have yet to take any action in this regard.finally, I think this game company is most likely to be of the same nature as Blizzard, so don’t have high expectations.Finally, regarding the experience penalty and my personal feeling, when the character is about to level up by the amount of experience (approximate experience: 50% or more), there will always be monsters that can kill the character immediately in the map, this phenomenon will always occur regardless of the difficulty of the map, and then 10% of the experience points that have been worked hard to increase are forcibly deducted, and all the time invested is wasted in this phenomenon.",False,N/A,N/A,"Sep 9, 2024",1,Metacritic
