(unlike you know which game) the combat is decent, but the controls are a bit clumsy and can take a while to get used to. i mainly played as a mage and a bit with a rogue. rogue was surprisingly fun, having a parry mechanic is neat af! and i loved that the game doesn't hold your hand for most puzzles, the characters don't mumble the solutions to you if you're stuck for longer than 10 seconds, and a lot of the puzzles were very fun to solve! on the downsides, the open world bloat is a bit excessive. especially the shards, massive amount of effort for a practically nonexistent payoff. i love my open world side content, but it needs to have more variety and a more balanced effort/reward ratio. the ending left me excited for what's to come, and hopefully one day we'll get a true and faithful sequel to this very cool game!",True,2.0,0.0,1762188990,,Steam

(do not play on any device before linking up your account. there is no simple log out button.) - once event duels end, there is no meaningful way in game to engage with casual play. - game locks packs of various archetypes, and you can only purchase these various types of packs by generating a card from that 'set' or using gems (earnable, but still a paid currency.) to hopefully pull an sr from the set. which then allows you to spend gems on the set you are actually aiming for. it's a yu-gi-oh! tcg simulator. as an official product that generates revenue, i would say it doesn't meet expectations. if you like yu-gi-oh! - you will enjoy yu-gi-oh! in the app. that's as far as it goes.",False,0.0,0.0,1763682868,,Steam

Legends of Runeterra,1284410,,,,,Highwayy,"legends of runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. most importantly, lor innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like hearthstone). with most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. the artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like league of legends and arcane. the game offers an incredible and near-endless pve experience in addition to pvp: in fact, pvp has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. the future is difficult to predict and i hope that pvp will grow more as my heart will always be in pvp gameplay. perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for pvp. and that is something hearthstone cannot boast.",True,,,"Jun 16, 2025",10.0,Metacritic

The Wolf Among Us,261030,,,,,HaloBlues,"god, i love this game. as tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something i dug, and it was done wonderfully here. the setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. the ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and i am both excited for and terrified of the sequel. hopefully it lives up to the first game's quality and ties up the loose ends it needs to. (sidenote i include with all telltale reviews: telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and i enjoy them when they do pop up in telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. they're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. they influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. the joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. i think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, i'd temper your expectations.)",True,,,"Mar 30, 2025",10.0,Metacritic

Griftlands,1942280,,,,,hardkot,"deck building gem visual (8/10) i like general sci fy design and drawing characters, but card design a bit average, for example in battle deck you can find a lot of card with same dagger, also after upgrading cards they will have same picture and same design, so you need to double check description, for card game is a minus. also music is average and almost don't change in different locations. interface is very important in card games. so my first impression was - emm another one messy over headed interface, but after some games i can say that it's very helpful, you just need to get used yo it. gameplay (8/10) gameplay is very addictive because you constantly upgrade your perks, cards, get new one and you can check different playstyles through one party. great idea to have more playable characters with different styles and story missions. on the other hand not so many perks are really unique and main strategy is pretty straightforward. story (7/10) story is pretty average, but i really like characters. and the fact that to know full picture you need to play this game more than one time. i think that all sci-fi lovers can fnd some references to different universes. so all in all, i like this game and still have it installed on my pc, so i can play it time to time. i definitely can recommend this game to everyone, neither you are big fan of card game, or just want to start your journey.",True,,,"Oct 8, 2022",8.0,Metacritic

The Messenger,1276390,,,,,Korelis,"a cute retro-style indie platformer, just like many other games in this genre. but oh boy does this game feel different. first, let's begin by what really matters : gameplay. this game is really fluid, with quick but still precise movement. the characters are a masterpiece of design, with their own sense of humour, quite absurd yet very effective. the time travel mechanic, with this completely different 16-bit style is a great game mechanic, that allows for exciting challenges. the metroidvania part where the levels that you got through in a classic left-to-right 2d platformer show much more depth is a great idea, although some may find it a bit repetitive. and finally, the ost. probably one of my favorites ost, with this 8-bit style music that where most songs ended up on my playlist. the newgame+ mechanic also allows for some replayability if you really enjoy the game. in conclusion, the messenger is definitely a great game, and itreally is worth your time.",True,,,"Oct 25, 2023",10.0,Metacritic

(played via remote play) there are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. however, unrailed! has something unique. you need to transport a train from point a to point b, while completing the tracks under its wheels. you need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. the multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task. after each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. however, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track. when your little train crashes, it is game over. all progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. unrailed! uses simple, ""minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. the character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving. the sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background. control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn. overall, i liked unrailed! especially with some friends on a saturday night. it offers some quick casual fun and with its unique concept, i would surely recommend it.",True,,,"Apr 23, 2025",7.0,Metacritic

Vampire Survivors,1794680,,,,,LordLoc75,"vampire survivors – review summaryvampire survivors is an addictive and deceptively simple roguelike shoot-’em-up where your character auto-attacks through endless waves of monsters, collecting upgrades, evolving weapons, and trying to survive for as long as possible—usually up to 30 minutes per stage before the inevitable arrival of a death-dealing reaper. with minimalistic controls but deep progression systems, it’s easy to pick up and hard to put down.developed by luca “poncle” galante, this indie gem began as a small solo project in 2021 and exploded into popularity thanks to its affordable price, nostalgic castlevania-inspired art, and wildly satisfying gameplay loop. what starts off slow quickly turns into chaotic bullet-heaven mayhem, with the screen packed with colorful enemies, projectiles, and loot. despite its visual simplicity, it’s mechanically rich, offering endless combinations of characters, weapons, power-ups, and unlockable **** game constantly rewards experimentation and persistence. each run earns gold that you can use to unlock permanent upgrades, characters, and relics, and players are encouraged to explore different builds and gameplay modifiers. its dlcs (both paid and free) continue to expand the content with new stages, characters, weapons, and crossover content from franchises like castlevania, among us, contra, and saga.content-wise, the game now includes local co-op, mobile cross-platform versions (with ads), and ports on nearly every major platform—including tesla cars—and even has a live-action film adaptation in the works.with nearly 53 hours of playtime, one player likened the experience to a serotonin bomb, comparing it to the addictive mind-control game from star trek. it’s thrilling, hypnotic, and overwhelming in the best way—though not for the photosensitive.final verdict: an exceptional indie time-sink bursting with charm, challenge, and replayability. highly recommended.score: 9.5/10",True,,,"May 12, 2025",9.0,Metacritic

Prodeus,1200570,,,,,kwstas2,"prodeus is an old school classic fps which takes inspiration from both the doom and quake series. it is a pretty good game and a satisfying shooter though is not perfect by a long shot in my opinion. what is best about it is the shooting and the sound design especially when it comes to gunfire sound effects. the level design through a decent amount of missions it provides is almost superb at its best to almost quite **** at its worst. the guns are pretty amazing overall and they are extremely fun to use with some being even better than others. visually is alright even with the retro thingy that is going for but still i wouldn't exactly say it's anything spectacular. what keeps it down for the most part in my eyes it's a lack of viriety in general whether it's the enemies, the environments, the textures etc. there is not much of any of that really. what annoyed me personally is the respawn system after death which is something similar to bioshock, i could explain why but i will just say that it just doesn't work for me. and the final thing which is not exactly a problem but maybe is worth mentioning is that the game is pretty short, it can get 10 hours give or take to do most things in the game.",True,,,"Apr 11, 2024",7.0,Metacritic
Prodeus,1200570,,,,,Nmaa18,"short review: i have three main issues. i noticed after 10 hours of playing that i had never died from an enemy, the difficulty is in finding the ores and the exploration/platforming more than the enemies themselves unlike in doom where both are difficult. secondly, i find that finding these ores is incredibly difficult, to the point where i often need to look online for their locations. even getting the map doesn't help much, as it lacks clarity and is convoluted. the issue is that the store is an integral part of the game, and not getting ores holds you back gameplay-wise. finally its a little bit repetitive, but i guess this is an inherent/vestigial trait of this sort of old school fps-style game. nevertheless, the game is still fun, and the sound design, style, and sfx are great and helps set prodeus apart from the rest. shooting feels great too. finally i like the amount of content there is, and the community maps is a great feature that adds a creative aspect and more replay-ability. it's a simple, fun game to briefly play daily. 76/100.",True,,,"Mar 5, 2024",7.0,Metacritic

""no two balatro match is truly the same"", ""the game's deep mechanics deserves so much love"", as if those two things aren't always the standard of a rogue-like game???maybe my bias is; i'm a very seasoned rogue-like player. hades, inscryption, slay the spire, risk of rain 2, dead cells etc. all of these games shaped up my expectation of a rogue-like entry. while i'm not taking away the fun that people are having with balatro (i'm absolutely having fun with the game too!), i feel like these things that people give balatro so much credit for, aren't anything but the genre's standard for me.this game is amazing, i won't deny that. it's a great value for anyone into the rogue-like genre, but i feel like the praises this game gets are a little overblown. compared to slay the spire, and inscryption, this game stands tall as a deck builer rogue-like with a fun & charming poker game aesthetic. presentation-wise, balatro isn't the most interesting thing out there, not even in my gaming library. however, an amazing game is an amazing game. i won't try to deny that. 9/10.",True,,,"Aug 31, 2025",9.0,Metacritic
