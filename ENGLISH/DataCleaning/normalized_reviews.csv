Legends of Runeterra,1284410,,,,Highwayy,"legends of runeterra is a brilliantly designed online trading card game. most importantly, lor innovates game mechanics with a back-and-forth format that objectively make this game more tactical (but maybe less beginner-friendly) than its peers (like hearthstone). with most actions that a player takes, the opponent has an option to respond, which often results in chains of actions with sometimes incredible comebacks/upsets. the artwork and animations are stellar, and the universe the game takes place in is advantaged by a rich legacy lore due to the producer's other products like league of legends and arcane. the game offers an incredible and near-endless pve experience in addition to pvp: in fact, pvp has sadly taken a back-seat in the last couple years but is by no means dead as matches only take minutes to find. the future is difficult to predict and i hope that pvp will grow more as my heart will always be in pvp gameplay. perhaps the most admirable quality of this game is its refusal to be ""pay-to-win"" as free cards and resources are given generously and consistently so that any player looking to play competitively can do so free of financial cost if they desire, at least for pvp. and that is something hearthstone cannot boast.",True,,,"Jun 16, 2025",10.0,Metacritic,5.41

The Wolf Among Us,261030,,,,HaloBlues,"god, i love this game. as tired as the concept may be for some, the idea of taking fairytale/fantasy characters and putting them into modern cities and realistic situations has always been something i dug, and it was done wonderfully here. the setting is vivid and easy to immerse yourself in, the characters are varied, likeable, and charming, the mystery is suspenseful and gripping, the choices and consequences are satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant. the ending has one of the cliffhangers that have haunted me most through my time in gaming, and i am both excited for and terrified of the sequel. hopefully it lives up to the first game's quality and ties up the loose ends it needs to. (sidenote i include with all telltale reviews: telltale's games often get a bad rap for having your choices not influence the story, but to me this misses the point of what they do. variant endings are a nice bonus in games, and i enjoy them when they do pop up in telltale's stories, but for the most part your choices aren't here to change where you go. they're there to change how you get there, who you are when you get there, and often who you get there with. they influence and change your relationships with the characters around you. the joy of replaying these games is to experience the different dialogue, the different reactions to you, the different routes you can take on the way, the different bonds you can evolve with people - not to have a wildly different ending. i think this aspect is overhated and sadly misunderstood by a lot of players, so if huge, game-changing differences are what you're looking for, i'd temper your expectations.)",True,,,"Mar 30, 2025",10.0,Metacritic,6.94

Griftlands,1942280,,,,hardkot,"deck building gem visual (8/10) i like general sci fy design and drawing characters, but card design a bit average, for example in battle deck you can find a lot of card with same dagger, also after upgrading cards they will have same picture and same design, so you need to double check description, for card game is a minus. also music is average and almost don't change in different locations. interface is very important in card games. so my first impression was - emm another one messy over headed interface, but after some games i can say that it's very helpful, you just need to get used yo it. gameplay (8/10) gameplay is very addictive because you constantly upgrade your perks, cards, get new one and you can check different playstyles through one party. great idea to have more playable characters with different styles and story missions. on the other hand not so many perks are really unique and main strategy is pretty straightforward. story (7/10) story is pretty average, but i really like characters. and the fact that to know full picture you need to play this game more than one time. i think that all sci-fi lovers can fnd some references to different universes. so all in all, i like this game and still have it installed on my pc, so i can play it time to time. i definitely can recommend this game to everyone, neither you are big fan of card game, or just want to start your journey.",True,,,"Oct 8, 2022",8.0,Metacritic,6.18

Pizza Tower,1070560,,,,Hushy2300isme,"the gameplay is more comparable to sonic than wario land as there is a huge emphasis on speed and momentum especially if you aim to 100% which requires getting every collectable and secret in each level while keeping a combo. each level introduces new mechanics including transformations which are very reminiscent of wario's transformations in wario land, there are also some difficult but fair bosses that are also similar to bosses in wario land. the art style is simple but charming and the soundtrack is extremely energetic. the level design is perfect for speedrunning and the move set has lots of depth which made replaying levels over and over again for 100% incredibly fun. all of this stuff may be overwhelming at first but mastering it made me feel like a speedrunner and gave me so much adrenaline, this is a game i could never get bored of.",True,,,"Nov 2, 2025",10.0,Metacritic,8.42

The Messenger,1276390,,,,Korelis,"a cute retro-style indie platformer, just like many other games in this genre. but oh boy does this game feel different. first, let's begin by what really matters : gameplay. this game is really fluid, with quick but still precise movement. the characters are a masterpiece of design, with their own sense of humour, quite absurd yet very effective. the time travel mechanic, with this completely different 16-bit style is a great game mechanic, that allows for exciting challenges. the metroidvania part where the levels that you got through in a classic left-to-right 2d platformer show much more depth is a great idea, although some may find it a bit repetitive. and finally, the ost. probably one of my favorites ost, with this 8-bit style music that where most songs ended up on my playlist. the newgame+ mechanic also allows for some replayability if you really enjoy the game. in conclusion, the messenger is definitely a great game, and itreally is worth your time.",True,,,"Oct 25, 2023",10.0,Metacritic,5.07

(played via remote play) there are many small indie games out there, many of them with exactly the same concept, idea, game mode etc. however, unrailed! has something unique. you need to transport a train from point a to point b, while completing the tracks under its wheels. you need to collect stone and wood to build tracks, cool down the engine from time to time using a water bucket and keep an eye of the movement of the train at all times. the multitasking makes it fun, especially with friends, where everyone has a different task. after each successful mission, you can buy upgrades for your train carts, making the later stages a little easier. however, in the later stages, the train will move faster and faster, giving you less time to complete the track. when your little train crashes, it is game over. all progress, upgrades and carts are lost, and you may start over again. unrailed! uses simple, ""minecraft"" graphics which are fine for a simple game like this. the character models look silly and hilarious, especially when moving. the sound effects and music are alright and just play nicely in the background. control wise, this game is very simple and easy to learn. overall, i liked unrailed! especially with some friends on a saturday night. it offers some quick casual fun and with its unique concept, i would surely recommend it.",True,,,"Apr 23, 2025",7.0,Metacritic,7.33

Dead Cells,588650,,,,RandomBolt,"this feels a similar game to play compared to pso or diablo, when it comes to how you progress. you get some pre-determined buffs after x deaths and collect cells to unlock upgrades. what does not look the same is that the randomness aspect means you have to slog through the same dungeons looking for the way out, instead of getting to the new areas fast, as on more classic rpgs. the areas just do not change enough to be interesting. it is the same type of upgrades scattered, same type of enemies, just spwaned differently. there is a pretty big lean into increasing difficulty through not restoring your life, which can make this incredibly frustrating. there is not much room in the combat to feel you are getting better, it is much more related to what you pick up and what upgrades you can keep unlocking. the massive christmas lights also don't help with enemy visibility and further deter from the combat being interesting. collectively, this has been the most frustrating game i've played in years. i have given this multiple tries but always put down the controller feeling like this is a waste of time and no fun is to be had here. at most, some 3h-4h of getting to know the game and the fun ends there.",False,,,"Jan 23, 2025",4.0,Metacritic,6.48

Dead Cells,588650,,,,mugen_is_here,the game's way too hard. you're expected to die repeatedly and slowly make the newer character stronger through a process of very slow grind. that's a very artificial way of expanding the time. the bosses are usually way too overpowered and they attack almost continously. i used the assist mode to change that to my liking so can't complain about the normal enemies. they were a fun breeze through. the levels became more and more maze-like where it becomes less of a platformer and more of a search for the right path by revisiting the old areas over and over again. most of the weapons that you get are pretty much a repeat of what you've already seen just with slightly different levels or slightly different extra effects. overall it's a pathetic experience.,False,,,"Aug 23, 2024",3.0,Metacritic,6.48

Dota 2,570,,,,MorfenA,"dota 2 is not just a game; it's an experience—a challenging, sometimes infuriating, but ultimately rewarding journey. for those unfamiliar, dota 2 is a highly complex multiplayer online battle arena (moba) game that demands strategy, skill, and ****’s be honest: dota 2 is hard. the steep learning curve can make it feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers. the intricacies of the game mechanics, the vast pool of heroes, and the ever-changing meta can leave even seasoned players scratching their heads. it's not uncommon to feel frustrated, to the point where you might consider breaking your keyboard or mouse after a tough **** that's also what makes dota 2 the perfect game. the intense emotions it evokes—from the highs of pulling off an incredible play to the lows of a devastating defeat—create memories that last a lifetime. every game is different, every match a new story.beyond the gameplay itself, dota 2 has a way of bringing people together. whether you're teaming up with old friends or meeting new ones from around the world, the bonds formed through shared victories (and defeats) are strong. many players find themselves making lasting friendships through the **** conclusion, dota 2 is a demanding but deeply fulfilling game. it challenges you, pushes you to your limits, but also rewards you with some of the most unforgettable gaming moments. if you're willing to invest the time and effort, you'll find that dota 2 is not just a game—it's a community, a passion, and a source of endless joy (and maybe a bit of rage too).",True,,,"Sep 5, 2025",10.0,Metacritic,5.0

Prodeus,1200570,,,,kwstas2,"prodeus is an old school classic fps which takes inspiration from both the doom and quake series. it is a pretty good game and a satisfying shooter though is not perfect by a long shot in my opinion. what is best about it is the shooting and the sound design especially when it comes to gunfire sound effects. the level design through a decent amount of missions it provides is almost superb at its best to almost quite **** at its worst. the guns are pretty amazing overall and they are extremely fun to use with some being even better than others. visually is alright even with the retro thingy that is going for but still i wouldn't exactly say it's anything spectacular. what keeps it down for the most part in my eyes it's a lack of viriety in general whether it's the enemies, the environments, the textures etc. there is not much of any of that really. what annoyed me personally is the respawn system after death which is something similar to bioshock, i could explain why but i will just say that it just doesn't work for me. and the final thing which is not exactly a problem but maybe is worth mentioning is that the game is pretty short, it can get 10 hours give or take to do most things in the game.",True,,,"Apr 11, 2024",7.0,Metacritic,9.15
Prodeus,1200570,,,,Nmaa18,"short review: i have three main issues. i noticed after 10 hours of playing that i had never died from an enemy, the difficulty is in finding the ores and the exploration/platforming more than the enemies themselves unlike in doom where both are difficult. secondly, i find that finding these ores is incredibly difficult, to the point where i often need to look online for their locations. even getting the map doesn't help much, as it lacks clarity and is convoluted. the issue is that the store is an integral part of the game, and not getting ores holds you back gameplay-wise. finally its a little bit repetitive, but i guess this is an inherent/vestigial trait of this sort of old school fps-style game. nevertheless, the game is still fun, and the sound design, style, and sfx are great and helps set prodeus apart from the rest. shooting feels great too. finally i like the amount of content there is, and the community maps is a great feature that adds a creative aspect and more replay-ability. it's a simple, fun game to briefly play daily. 76/100.",True,,,"Mar 5, 2024",7.0,Metacritic,9.15

Disco Elysium,632470,,,,criticaldude,"almost 50 hours of playtime, in which 90% (or potentially more) of gameplay is basically just dialogue. if it sounds boring or you just don't like reading (though there is voice acting) i'd still strongly suggest giving it a shot. the writing in this game is beyond impressive. close to perfection. a masterpiece which is best to explore as blindly as possible. if you are planning to play it anyway, dont look up anything,experience it yourself. its baffling to me how captivating the story is and how the ""gameplay"" just flows. multiple times during the first playthrough i found myself sitting there for hours basically just talking to people. an entire dialogue can take up to 20-30 minutes even and at the end of each conversation it leaves you with clue or an idea which you wanna find out more about. if you're up for an epic, incredibly humorous, adventure in this detective role playing game with incredible storytelling, characters, worldbuilding, soundtrack and art direction i beg you, at the very least, give it a try.",True,,,"Jun 28, 2024",10.0,Metacritic,5.13

Sea of Stars,1449850,,,,Hackattaque,"like chained echoes, sea of stars is a beautifully crafted throwback to the 90s rpg era, complete with all the quality of life improvements that we’d expect in the 2020s. no more random battles, painful level grinding and scattered save points; and as for the old-school ways of turn-based combat, it’s been given some clever twists, including a puzzle-lock system that gives you a chance to stop your opponent’s attack with the right spells. where chained echoes goes for a very elaborate and epic story full of plot twists, though, sea of stars goes for a more intimate and cozy tale of friendship and loyalty between three childhood friends who have a clear enemy to defeat. and whereas chained echoes had some fairly sprawling level environments, sea of stars has a more compact approach to dungeons, with tight puzzles to solve and pretty varied themes. i would say overall i preferred sea of stars for its moment-to-moment gameplay and chained echoes for its story. both have pacing issues and neither quite manages to reach classic status; still, i enjoyed both a lot and hope their developers will put out even better follow-ups.",True,,,"Mar 8, 2025",8.0,Metacritic,6.09

Nier Automata,524220,,,,Valeriaaaaa,"personally, my expectation from an rpg game is definitely having combo mechanics in combat. in my opinion, this was one of the biggest shortcomings of nier. when we look at other rpg games like devil may cry or final fantasy, we see that they do this very well. we experience combat at its peak with dozens of combo mechanics. nier, on the other hand, only offers us 2 different attack options and doesn't really showcase the combo differences between weapons. for example, i didn't see much animation difference between swords. i don't know. nier disappointed me in this regard, although the combat animations are quite nice. the second issue is the insufficient variety of enemies. i don't call the same robot with some metal scraps added on top and its level increased a different type of enemy. another issue is the environment design; i really didn't expect it to be this weak. if you want to understand what i mean, just look at the abandoned city map. that's all i have to say. this game, which has the potential to be much better and to enter the top 10 of the greatest rpg games, has been left in the lurch. it's sad that it is so little known even with 2b's influence. when i ask anyone around me, i hear that the only reason they play this game is 2b. it actually explains a lot...",True,,,"Jul 15, 2024",7.0,Metacritic,7.44

Life is Strange True Colors,1222690,,,,CnPx98,this game is really underrated. i thought the story was amazing and because of the interactions i focused even more then i would whilst watching tv which made it even better. i really loved all the characters and found them all interesting. the game can be slow at times but even during them moments i never lost interest because the story still was moving forward at a good pace. a couple of things that i didn't like was that the game was way to easy. i know it focusing on story telling but still would have been nice if on the odd occasion something challenged you like qtes (quick time events) or some harder puzzles. a couple missions were kind of detective sort of thing but they were mostly self explanatory. another thing that was frustrating but not really an issue with the actual gameplay. for some reason when i 1st installed the game it kept crashing after completing chapter 1 and loading chapter 2. i tried verifying files (xbox app) and that didn't fix the issue. when i reinstalled it was fine thou. mite have been a corrupt file or something. it was saying something about a ue4 siren but no error code. another thing to note was that throughout the hole game i was getting random screen tearing during cutscenes. i tried messing about with video settings but nothing solved the problem. apparently it is just an issue with the game. its annoying thou cos the game has been out half a year and this should be fixed. overall the game is amazing and i really enjoyed it. if you enjoy slow pace story games then you should give it a go!,True,,,"May 10, 2022",8.0,Metacritic,5.34

Balatro,2379780,,,,Nazrielau05,"after 4 hours of playing balatro, i think i've shaped up a reasonable opinion;yes, i could see why this game took the world by storm. it's incredibly intuitive in user interface design and combat mechanics. the soundtrack is cool, the visuals are okay, and the gameplay in general is addicting. but for me, that's when it ends.i absolutely have a certain bias against this game and i'll admit that. when i see reviews on steam and metacritic, i feel like people are praising this game just for the sake of it. they're mentioning these, very very basic structures and spices for any rogue-like game entry. ""no two balatro match is truly the same"", ""the game's deep mechanics deserves so much love"", as if those two things aren't always the standard of a rogue-like game???maybe my bias is; i'm a very seasoned rogue-like player. hades, inscryption, slay the spire, risk of rain 2, dead cells etc. all of these games shaped up my expectation of a rogue-like entry. while i'm not taking away the fun that people are having with balatro (i'm absolutely having fun with the game too!), i feel like these things that people give balatro so much credit for, aren't anything but the genre's standard for me.this game is amazing, i won't deny that. it's a great value for anyone into the rogue-like genre, but i feel like the praises this game gets are a little overblown. compared to slay the spire, and inscryption, this game stands tall as a deck builer rogue-like with a fun & charming poker game aesthetic. presentation-wise, balatro isn't the most interesting thing out there, not even in my gaming library. however, an amazing game is an amazing game. i won't try to deny that. 9/10.",True,,,"Aug 31, 2025",9.0,Metacritic,6.53

Just Shapes and Beats,774781,,,,Nove123,"what is this game is difficult to notice among many indie games, as it seems at first glance one figurative. but is it? today i want to make a remark about what to look at it. well, let's start with the visual, it's beautiful here, these words will be enough. and what about the gameplay has something to say. firstly, he is strongly associated with music here and it is damn unusual in comparison with today's indie games. secondly, its dynamism in some moments just rolls over, sometimes you don't even know where to hide in order to survive. the plot is here, but it is difficult to call it not childish, because it is built on friendship and mutual assistance. but in addition to the advantages in the game there are downsides, but rather they are connected with my preferences. firstly, the duration of the game is negligible, because it took me almost 2 hours to go through it. secondly, there are too few music levels here, as they depend on the amount of music, but all music is not really them, therefore i see no reason to add so little music. and then there are some problems with complexity. since it is at some points off scale, and in most cases average. if you warn us about the occurrence of epilepsy and you are aimed at a danish audience, then why add casual mode, you'd better add a more complicated mode. summing up, i want to say, if you like the genre of dubstep music, electro and you want to have a nice evening, then this game is just born for you, since there is online and cooperative modes and answering the question: ""is the game worth the money?"" i can answer: ""yes worth it!"".",True,,,"Jun 1, 2019",9.0,Metacritic,9.57

Monster Train,1548850,,,,Vulgrim,"i watched the game for a long time before buying it and saw its potential. currently, it may not have a lot of possibilities, but as i mentioned - it has the potential for much more. in my opinion, it is more fun to play than slay the spire, if only because of a more thoughtful system of improving cards (because we decide ourselves how we improve our creatures and spells) and the requirement of more frequent combinatorics. for me, an advantage (though probably not everyone likes it that much) is the lack of annoying rng, which will quickly destroy our approach. we also have interesting multi modes and interestingly designed daily challenges. the soundtrack is also very nice. of course, as in any game of this type, we would like there to be even more cards, artifacts, enemies, etc. this is also the case, but i don't think the game will stop as it is. in addition, i hope that in the future the creators will develop their game, which at the time of release seems to offer more than slay the spire after adding (years later) the fourth character. after time, you can see the game is developing - there are new leaders, bosses and mutators of the game. keep it up!",True,,,"May 26, 2021",9.0,Metacritic,5.23

Monster Train,1548850,,,,Mirrorminx,"this is the most content-rich deckbuilder rogue like game out there, and has a huge breadth of interesting mechanics, choices, and difficulty that make it stand apart from it's competitors. many reviews compare this to slay the spire, which is a great, but straightforward game. this game has a lot more varied mechanics, strategies, and deck styles, with five factions, units & spell based strategies. cards can be individually customized with upgrades, and refining your deck is about much more than just trimming your deck down to a lean machine (which is the optimal strategy in most other deck builders). while some cards are niche, every unit and card has a place in an interesting strategy, and the starting faction (hellhorned) barely scratches the surface of what lies beneath. don't buy this if you don't like deck builders: while it is mechanically very different from slay the spire, the deck and cards still form the backbone of how you play. but truly, this game is genre-defining, it does so many things well, and after having played dozens of deck builders on mobile and pc, this is by far my favorite in this genre",True,,,"Oct 28, 2020",10.0,Metacritic,5.23

Apex Legends,1172470,,,,JKaiya,"personally my favorite battle royale, but the matchmaking is so fkd and they refuse to fix it. you start getting matched against leaderboard players the moment your gold. solo q as a masters player gets you a gold-diamond player. but even if u group q it does sht as you'd get matched into the same top lobby where you can't even win a gunfight and are forced to camp to try and get points. non ranked gamemode is even worse as unrated you are forced into a full pred / washed pred lobby once your good enough, as all the normal players quit or are forced to play ranked to avoid that fkd q as at least there'd be some diamond/plat squad that got fkd and qd into that gold-pred lobby in ranked. apex had by far the worst ranked system i've ever played. they refused to fix this matchmaking due to needing the streamers/tubers to keep farming kids to advertise their game",False,,,"Aug 14, 2024",3.0,Metacritic,4.33

Path of Exile,238960,,,,Rebe1,"the games is not a masterpiece but it's pretty demn close. gameplay, complexity, overall feeling in building your own hero (both equipment and skills), market (player2player trading, recently added market house), community, developer transparency, business model, continuous development cycle, music... so what's bad here? not so much. some may claim graphics feels old but for game released over a decade ago i would say graphics is decent enough. others could complain about complexity and high entry-point but again - this game over last ten years received new content 3-4 times per each year, with most of it still present in game mechanics. and all of that is f2p - that is, if you are mastermind of stash micromanagement, otherwise for 20-30$ you get a bunch of stash-tabs (+ equivalent value in points to spent on mtx). so far this is one and only true heir of diablo 2, the ultimate arpg game which can only lose its crown to upcoming poe2.",True,,,"Jun 26, 2023",9.0,Metacritic,4.03
