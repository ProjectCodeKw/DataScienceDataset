It has a lot of side content, and there is definitely fun to be had, but it is more so in the Fallout 3 way of making your own fun. The cyberware feels half-baked, the perk system still feels like a first draft, melee feels basically unusable at higher difficulties, the writing is either pretty decent or just abysmal, a lot of the quest design is pretty boring and underdeveloped, the main quest ends right as it seems like it is about to get really interesting, and the city itself feels flat. It's got a lot of pretty buildings to look up at, but there is basically no meaningful verticality that the game plays with. At full price, I can not in good faith recommend the game. 

Phantom Liberty is a little better, I would probably rank it independently at around a 7/10 or maybe an 8/10, but that is mainly just because the writing and quest design is better and a lot tighter than the main game.

Movement is a little too floaty, feeling similar to ARK.
The skill tree feels like it should be split up so basic survival skills (e.g mining/chop speed) are not taking away from the more fun skills.
At least early on, the game does not feel great in terms of scaling to a larger group. We tried with 6 people  and there is a constant blast of information as people unlock things or talk to NPCs, and it feels silly just whacking every enemy in a 6v1 fight.

I know it's Early Access, but holy moly is this ever rough around the edges. A lot of basic tutorials that you'd expect to get are simply not there, and the AI is pretty much ""run in straight line and attack, repeat"" for every enemy- which can still be difficult because enemies are often just spammed at you from spawners you can barely see and any attacks from behind count as backstab, even for enemies. So an enemy you didn't even know had spawned behind you can one shot you.

Which brings me to my next major gripe:  Darksouls style artificial difficulty.  Some traps and even simply existing in some areas will INSTANTLY KILL YOU. With no warning or indication whatsoever. The worst being the Shroud itself. The game doesn't tell you there are multiple ""levels"" of shroud, which to the player just looks like fog. There is no distinction between levels apparently. So you can be walking through shroud and be fine, then simply touch a higher level shroud and just instantly die. Insult to injury is that the game flashes a message on your screen warning you that you're IN a harder shroud area. *After* you are dead.

Being a caster is kind of a joke, as staffs require mana AND ammo, which is a huge pain in the ass to get mats for early on. Then there's the game's automatic target locking. You can't freely aim, you are stuck locking onto enemies and it can seriously screw you over if you're trying to shoot a barrel next to an enemy because. While I only found out later you can hold T and it will cancel target lock but only while holding T. There's permanent toggle.

I will say, the story is by far the strongest part of this game. I also really like that the devs tried a new spin on the genre, by adding interesting movement abilities. However, the levels were a bit too simple to really let these shine (even when backtracking, these abilities were used in pretty simplistic ways). 
The combat was okay, there were only a couple of weapon types (though they came with different special attacks, they were largely the same). The enemy variety was good considering the short runtime. 
The combat overall was really easy even w/o the assist mode. The bosses were a letdown - they were incredibly easy, and didn't really have any moves or combos to worry about. Also, their attack hitboxes were *really* bad - a lot of them you could just hug and they'd not be able to hit you with most of their attacks.

It is typical of a dark souls type of game with steep learning curve and monsters that respawn after each death or interaction with saving point.

In other games, where monsters do not respawn after each death and saving point, I usually play on adventure mode, like the step above story mode, but never hard core mode. I get tired of the unending grinding of games like this, where your progress don't mean shit if you havent reached a saving point. Killing 50 monsters just to die to the boss, and then having to kill them all again, is not my idea of fun.

Big plus that they have added ""assist"" mode so you can play more as in a story mode or similar to enjoy the game more, avoiding the unending grinding and actually be able to finish the game, even as an average player.

The game itself was fun however there were a few things about it which i did not like and make the game definetily not worth the full price.

1. The game is a walk in the park... For calling itself a soulslike it is way too easy. I actually did every single boss first try except (ironically) the very first one where i died once cause i wasnt familiar with the movement of my own character. At the whole 12 hour run I only died 3 times even though im by no means a god gamer... im a soulslike fan so i actually enjoy getting my ass spanked by a hard game which this game sadly could not deliver the slightest.

2. The maps all look similar especially the first 3-4 big regions so it is too monotonous for my taste. Got a bit better to the end of the game but the start was too equal looking.

3. Mob recycling is crazy in this game... Holy shit there are actually only like 5 types of enemie which get recycled throughout the whole game by getting a different weapon or element but basically still being the same enemy.

4. As mentioned earlyier its too pricey for what it brings to the table. I would say a fair price would be 20€ but would strongly advise against buying it for everything above that price.

I spent a lot of frustrating time looking for a way to adjust the controls without saving and quitting before I realized that ""save and quit"" was some imbecile's way of saying of ""save settings"".

Everything else here is here to fill the page. This is a highly derivative game in a saturated class of games that I am sick to death of.

The idea is honestly fantastic. You’re in this alternate version of Paris where robot soldiers patrol the streets and the city’s in chaos. It sounds cool, right? It even looks cool at first. But it gets boring fast. I'm tired of the boring AF DS tropes/mechanica and lack of imagination in how the game works. Soulslikes need to come up with a way to feel different. This one doesn't. Not that many do. And (as usual with what seems like all soulslikes) also plays like crap on PC, and was clearly only really intended for the console audience. I have a PC interface. USE IT. I'm sick of tabbing through items and other assumptions of a controller-only setup. I'm just not interested in playing anything anymore (period) that doesn't take advantage of the fact that I have a proper set of PC input devices at my disposal.

The combat never feels quite right. Everything feels a bit floaty, like your attacks don’t really connect. Enemies are mostly the same few types repeated over and over, and the boss fights just drag on forever. There’s no real excitement to them, just a lot of health bars and awkward timing.

Exploring the city is kind of boring too. The areas look nice but they all blur together. It feels like you’re being guided through narrow paths pretending to be open streets. You keep looping back on yourself for no good reason, and the rewards for exploring aren’t worth it anyway. The world just feels empty. Pretty, but dead.

Performance isn’t great either. The game stutters sometimes even on a good PC, and the animations are stiff. The story wants to be deep and meaningful but it’s so flat that it never lands. Everyone talks like they’re reading lines off a script, and I stopped caring about the plot halfway through.

It’s a shame because there are moments that almost work. The designs of the machines and costumes are amazing, and the first time you see the city on fire is genuinely striking. But that makes it worse in a way, because you can see what the game could have been.

In the end, Steelrising feels like a beautiful idea that never made it out of the prototype stage. It’s not awful, but it’s not fun either. It just kind of clanks along until you give up.",False,3,0,1761510073

I've been through like 3 or 4 levels and I can already feel the enemy reuse.

Dolmen,1283400,49.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198047984519,"Steelrising sounds like such a great idea on paper. Imagine an alternate history version of the French Revolution where King Louis XVI actually manages to defeat the revolutionaires with an army of clockwork automatons. Even better, you yourself are a former dancer-automaton named Aegis, tasked by Queen Marie Antoinette to find your maker, Eugène de Vucanson, and eventually fight your way through Paris to stop the King himself.

It’s an amazing premise, and having visited Paris a number of times I was excited to see how developers Spiders would bring this alternative history version to life. Unfortunately, a great concept cannot make up for unimaginative and repetitive level design, poorly-implemented combat, terrible optimisation, and a level of jank that is difficult to put up with.

Let’s start with the good stuff. You do get to see a handful of the capital’s iconic locations, including Versailles, Notre Dame, La Louvre, Les Tuileries and, of course, The Bastille, even if once you actually get inside you discover they all share a very similar set of assets. I enjoyed the different historically-inspired clothing here as well, and those that enjoy a bit of fashion souls can find plenty of tricorne hats and frilly shirts to suit their fancy. There are only seven main bosses in the game, but they are all fairly different, with interesting move-sets that need to be learnt to beat them. Finally, the map to travel around Paris is a nice touch too, rendered as a piece of old parchment.

Unfortunately, that’s more or less where the good stuff ends. I disliked Aegis’s move animation immensely. She’s either walking far too slow, or running far too fast in a disjointed, weird-looking sprint. Jumping is finicky and imprecise, only slightly alleviated by some extra traversal moves you get later into the game. Combat is strangely unresponsive : I often got the impression my character would dodge a second or so after I pressed the button, and the hit-boxes are very strange, with both my weapon and the enemies passing through me without either of us getting hit. 

My weapon of choice, the trust halberd, has an almost laughable range, and you can thrust at enemies that are three or four meters away, with Aegis seemingly getting rubber-banded to their location. In another instance, I stun-locked a miniboss with a series of heavy attacked which meant he never touched me at all. 

There are your traditional soulslike stats and weapon upgrades, though nothing particularly innovative apart from an overheat system that never really bothered me. What did bother me was the succession of drab, uninspired Parisian streets that made up most of the game, occasionally replaced by repetitive gardens and hedge mazes, all with the same gates, benches, and statues. This isn’t helped by the fact that a lot of the game inexplicably takes place at night. It’s such a shame because Paris itself is a wonderful place, and with a larger budget or a bit more imagination we could have had some vibrant, colourful locales similar to what the team developing Enotria The Last Song managed to pull off.

The story is intriguing enough, but gets a bit lost in its own convoluted lore, and despite including real historical figures like Robespierre, Necker, and Lafayette, is dolled out mostly during scenes where three of four NPC monologue at you until you are eventually sent off to complete another quest.

Lastly, I will touch briefly on the many bugs I encountered, three years after release, including several hard crashes, textures not loading in properly, or, perhaps the most annoying, a loss of focus after using a “vestal” bonfire which meant everything suddenly looked way too blurry. 

I was really disappointed with Steelrising, as its concept was so promising and other games such as Lies of P have shown how fun it can be to take cultural elements from our own history and change them in new and exciting ways.

I bought Fallout First all those years, though one of those was because I forgot to cancel the auto-renewal. Still, I enjoyed playing this game and completing the battle pass every season. There's plenty of content in this game now after all the updates to keep you engaged for as long as I was.

Here's probably something more important for most people: why I stopped playing Fallout 76 for a while. I believe the only reason I was able to play this game every day without getting tired was because of Fallout First. Like Elder Scrolls Online, the subscription gives you an unlimited stash amount that is required for long term enjoyment. Even though I didn't craft so many things to the point I needed all that space, it just cuts out a significant amount of frustration. There's already too much micromanagement and menuing in this game that I hate. Adding more by requiring me to stop playing and drop all my junk items and ammo so I can sprint again is astronomically stupid. I already spent more on this game than any other game I've ever played by paying for Fallout First for 3 years. That's $300 + $40 (PC version a few weeks after launch) + $10 (Xbox version a year after launch) = $350. I never buy microtransactions or subscriptions for any games. I play 100s of hours of Call of Duty and progress the battle pass, all without paying a dime. I can ignore $50 skins and $20 battle passes that only give emblems and calling cards with a couple double XP tokens mixed in. I don't excuse any of that nonsense, but I can enjoy the game with it. This game is an exception for me, and all the money I've paid isn't enough for them (the developers / publishers). I truly can't enjoy this game without Fallout First. I love scavenging and collecting things in the open world. Dropping them all the time makes it feel like a waste, and there's not enough storage space for non payers. The more I talk about the game's bad business practices, the less I want to recommend it, so I'll stop here. Just know that I could go on. I could go on and on and on...

This game is pretty great and should be an easy recommendation to anyone who just wants to play something with their brain off while they watch a video or chat with their friends. It provides a casual experience where there's always something to do, but you can stop whenever you want. The biggest flaw that completely drives me away is that the game doesn't want me to play unless I'm always paying. Other games provide a playable experience for the base price of purchasing the game, but not this one. If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time recommending this game without a massive caveat. Honestly, the only thing that got me into this game as much as I was was playing with my brother. I enjoyed so many experiences I had with this game in all the years it's been out, but I can't get that anymore without continuously paying. I'll pop back into this game occasionally to try new content, but it never holds me for long. It's just sad that it has to be this way. This game is capable of standing alongside the other live service juggernauts but holds itself back needlessly. 

I'm only writing this review because of the Steam Awards, but it really let me reflect on the kind of game this is. I have so much more I could say, I mean I probably have close to 1000 hours of playtime across Steam, PS5, and Xbox. I just don't think anyone will read this on a 7 year old game with over 40,000 reviews. I guess if what I said is interesting enough to others, I'll come back and write more, but I've already spent enough time writing what I have. I hope anyone reading this understands where I'm coming from with this review. I doubt I'll be changing anything in the games industry with this, but I just wanted to say what's on my mind. Games can be better. So much love, care, and passion is poured into these 100 million dollar projects that it's such a shame to take all that away for a quick extra buck. But I know nobody does anything for free, and money has to be made at some point. The truly talented people are able to place that barrier in appropriate spots. If I could take this game offline and play with mods, I would easily add 100s of more hours. As it is now, though, as it was designed... I'm just sad.",False,0,0,1764091152

While working through my games backlog, I like to pace myself by playing one fairly ""normal"" game and following that up with something weird as hell. [b]Golden Light[/b] falls firmly in the latter category; however, what started as a very intriguing premise would turn out to be a bit of a disappointment.

In Golden Light, our unnamed protagonist descends into the depths of the Gut searching for She, his lost lady love. Here, the Gut serves as both the environment and the antagonist, becoming angrier and more hostile the more enemies you kill. And if you find it all too much to bear, you can always appease it by hurting yourself or making offerings…

From what I saw, the story in Golden Light closely follows the Silent Hill ""formula"" (or at least, what's been accepted as the Silent Hill Formula over the years): our protagonist is lost and trapped in a purgatory-like place, searching for a loved one. This fairly well-worn base is then topped with a generous smattering of meat and weirdness (with a sprinkle of Cronenberg and Lynch), giving Golden Light a unique and genuinely unsettling vibe.

Look, I'ma be real - I'm not a huge fan of games whose idea of horror is enemies barrelling down towards me, screaming bloody murder. And since this is basically Golden Light's main shtick, I think you'll understand why I dropped it so quickly.

If you're OK with constant, annoying jump scares, I think there's actually something to Golden Light. The meat aesthetic alone is unique enough to merit at least giving it a try, and for all I know, the story might go deeper than the surface-level stuff I saw would suggest.",False,2,0,1756381812

Moment to moment gameplay here is mostly scouring the floor you're in, looking for keys which will give you access to the next floor, while avoiding traps and enemies (and combat), and collecting resources that can all be used in multiple ways. Got a consumable? You can either eat it or throw it at enemies to trigger status effects. Got a new weapon? You can either use it (with very poor control and damage in general), throw it (for status effects) or eat it (?) as well. Managing these resources while deciding when to engage in combat is the core to the game, and it took me almost four hours to really understand it, since it's a very obtuse game (and unashamedly so).

So, if you want a run and gun game, this is not it. This is a much more cerebral and cautious kind of game. Buyer beware.

Outside of the 'dungeon floors' you have a hub world that is as weird as the levels, and even after beating the game I'm still confused as to how to navigate it. There's certainly a proper way, an optimal path, but I have absolutely no idea what it is.

Now, I didn't love the gameplay, and hence is why I wouldn't recommend the game. But one thing that it gets absolutely right are the vibes. Visual design, sound design, enemies, environments, loading screens and transitions, everything is super well alligned to the vibe the game wants to convey, and there's something really satisfying to see gel together.

Before even starting the game, opening the settings in the launcher almost crashed my PC and caused the fans to go crazy.
So I never touched that again, but it continued inside the game in the form of massive frame drops and freezes even in cutscenes and also crashed multiple times.

On top of that I've encountered some of the most random bugs such as subtitles stop working on a specific mission, camera won't open on a mission where you need to take pictures or not being able to continue after solving a puzzle and having to restart the game.

Addendum: I already completed the game yesterday but they seem to have released a minor patch to fix a bug with button combinations today, though they still haven't touched the others I've seen which when I googled them I found out some still exist from the PS4 version release.

Either wait until this is heavily discounted or just pirate it.

[i]I originally wrote this review in 2022 but wasn't able to publish it since I played it through family share, don't know why I can post it now but I'm leaving it as is.

Since a few years have passed I don't know if any of the bugs I encountered are fixed but seeing many were ported over from even older versions I'd wager that they're still there.

TL;DR: Good game, bad bugs.

Hogwarts Legacy,1817070,23.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Casual",76561198095708276,"Seeing how this is: 
- the 2nd highest selling PS4 game of all time: 
  -- especially how late during the console's life-cycle it was released
- Spider-Man 2 is the highest selling PS5 game of all time
I thought I would have nothing to lose getting it. I bought it via a CD key and took the risk; which excludes it from Steam's refund policy. 

But this goes to show, that, both mass critic and user reviews, cannot be relied upon as it is mostly generated hype and cult followings, favouring style over substance.

This game unfortunately falls into the generic Ubisoft sandbox. The map is huge, but there is little ways to interact with the world. The people walking around are nothing but cardboard NPCs, and the buildings are just blocks for you to swing off. There are no interiors and few unique charms that make exploring the city worth while. A denser, more alive open world with more content would have done this world favours.

The physics and controls are pretty tight. Spiderman has a varied move-set and the combat is somewhat similar to Batman Arkham series, where you have to perform timed dodges, deal with enemies wielding melee or ranged weapons, shields etc which means you have to spin a different combo to deal with them and not mash the same buttons. That part works, what doesn't is the overall game-loop. 

- the graphics are not that great, older titles like MGS Phantom Pain look far more stunning
- there is no day and night cycle or changes to weather - they do change based on story script only, so if you are just exploring, the world feels static, not dynamic.
- the side-quests are just generic activities:
  -- wave fights: (personally I think this is one of the lowest forms of gameplay, to program it you just need a simple loop of enemy respawns and triggered conditions). The particular waves in this game get very tiresome, it isn't a matter of skill, but endurance.
-- crimes: a bit better than endless waves, short and sweet, but nothing special. Vehicle chases means swinging after a vehicle, then pressing some Quick Time Events to watch a few animations.
  -- collectibles: backpacks, pidgeons etc. simply means gathering them. There isn't a skill based challenge or a gadget themed puzzle requiring you to get them. Reaching the pointer on the map and grabbing them is enough
  -- Ubisoft towers (really dated legacy mechanic most people are tired off, interact with a tower, reveal portion of the map)
  -- photographs landmarks (there are a few unique buildings, you just pull out the camera and snap a photo)
- full of mundane progression minigames - if anyone remembers Bioshock's Pipe-Dream hacking minigame, well this is back, but in the form of electric circuits. I never liked minigames, I just want to play the game, but when you have to repeat the same minigame over and over it gets stale and repetitive very quickly. In contrast to Arkham, those games require you use your gadgets to interact with your environment, where as here you find detached minigames that don't at all link to Spiderman or any of his tools. 
  -- Luckily, accessibility options do allow you to skip them entirely, which I did gladly.
- Skill trees: in the 2010s era every exclusive sandbox had to have the 3 skill trees: tap A to do this faster; take less damage;  something affects 1 more enemy etc. - quantitative checkbox updates rather than quality updates that affect how you interact with the world.
- enemy AI is not dynamic and reactive like in Arkham, they won't start destroying perch points once they see you them. They will behave in the same manner throughout
- The MJ and Miles sections are scripted, linear stealth sections. You cannot change how its done or pick your own route, you go from point to point as you're told and cannot deviate from this line.
- I don't know why so many devs obsessed with cinema do this, but if you want to explain a narrative, just add a cutscene. Instead you will be stopped with many sections that require forced walking, you walk around a room, and press the action button to interact with an object, the character speaks some monologue about what you saw, then you have to repeat this several times until you have interacted with enough objects/the correct object. Again, I just want to play the real game, save these interaction sequences for cutscenes, don't force me to hold ""up"" for 5 minutes pressing ""Y"" to move the game forward.

The pluses are:
+ lots of different suits, gadgets and suit mods to modify your play style
+ controls and physics feel tight
+ web slinging feels tight and controlled
+ map is large
+ lots of Marvel characters make an appearance

Overall I really find it hard to understand how this outsold, especially so much later in the console's lifecycle, much more dynamic and innovative titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and MGS Phantom Pain. The game mostly borrows all of its mechanics from other titles, but doesn't contribute anything innovative of its own.

My recommendation is to buy this from Steam directly, that way if you don't like it and played under 2 hours, you can refund it - this will give you ample time to test it, as what you see in those 2 hours is what you will get throughout. Or try to see if you can play a demo version. 

If you find yourself that you are not tired of generic open world games like Assassin's Creed and many other Ubisoft titles, then you can probably sink into this. But if you strive for quality and innovation, try the demo before buying (or buy directly from Steam, and request a refund in under 2 hours). To me a lot of this is very last gen, if it came out in 2012 it would have been top tier, but even Arkham City outclasses this game and has a more unique variety of activities in its sandbox, despite having a much smaller world. And that being said, I also think that most Ubisoft sandboxes are actually a lot more fun than this game, even AC Odyssey whose map is far too large and has literal fetch quests offers more thrills.",False,5,0,1762982330

	I've sunk over a thousand hours into 7 Days to Die over the years, a testament to how fantastic this game [b] used to be. [/b] The core concept of a voxel-based zombie survival crafting game is brilliant, and for a long time, it delivered some truly memorable experiences. The issue is that the game I fell in love with is not the game it is today, and the developers (""The Fun Pimps"") seem intent on a cycle of endless, often regressive, change rather than refinement.

	My lack of recommendation comes down to one core problem: the developers constantly redesign fundamental systems from the ground up with almost every major update. Instead of building on existing mechanics, they scrap them entirely, forcing veteran players to re-learn a ""new"" game every single time. This isn't early access refinement; it's a lack of vision.

    • [b] Scrapped Mechanics: [/b] We've seen multiple iterations of progression systems, from the ""learn by doing"" model to the current perk and magazine-based system. Each change feels like a sideways step, often removing depth and features that the community enjoyed (like empty jars or specific meat types) for no apparent reason other than change for change's sake.

    • [b] Forced Playstyles: [/b] Recent updates have introduced systems like biome progression tied to loot stages, which can feel linear and removes the open-world freedom that was a hallmark of earlier alphas. Base designs and creative building approaches that players developed over time are often patched out, forcing specific, developer-approved play styles.

    • [b] An ""Eternal Early Access"": [/b] After more than a decade in Early Access, the game still feels unpolished in many areas, while basic, long-promised features like bandits or robust NPC systems remain missing (though competently implemented by the modding community). The recent 1.0/2.0 updates have only amplified these frustrations, adding poorly implemented features like the annoying storm system that just waste time.
	
     I got my money's worth, absolutely. But I cannot recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state, nor can I endorse the development philosophy. If you are looking for a stable, long-term survival experience that consistently builds on its foundations, this isn't it. The game is a revolving door of concepts, and you never know when the mechanics you enjoy will be completely removed in the next patch.

Delays, seasonal story pacing, and technical issues during major updates strain la player’s patience. The cost of expansions, seasons, cosmetic items, and additional features becomes overwhelming when combined.

I've tried to play this game at least 2 different times. I always tend to give up and get bored around the 4 hour mark of the tutorial missions. When you compare the tutorial mission a guardian rises from Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 there really is a night and day difference. One cutscene dumping a decade of Destiny lore in a minute is not really the play in terms of good story telling. It's unfortunately out of necessity since they ""vaulted""/deleted half of the story rather than having the story unfold as the player experiences it.

Additionally the vaulting of content is the dumbest thing ever. It's 2025 and they haven't figured out how to add content without needing to subtract content. Meanwhile look at other free to play games like Warframe which continue to improve on the new player experience and add new content while keeping old content completely 100% playable. Every change is either an addition or something that genuinely was better for the game.

Destiny 1 was the better game and it's a shame we never got a PC port. Destiny 2 needs to improve the new player experience and return the vaulted content. If it did that it would be a genuinely good game. The gameplay is solid and the story has a lot of potential, but until those things are fixed this is not a good game and it is not worth giving this company your money or your time.

With ups and downs, when they launched The Final Shape, we tought they would come back and be what the players wanted. We were very wrong.

Destiny used to be a unique game. ""Planets"" to visit, amazing campaign, well written villains and characters in general. With some teaks here and there, some QoL changes (like Lfg, loadouts and subclasses 3.0), legendary campaign for the old ones (Red War, CoO, Wm and Forsaken) and also, some changes of bosses mechanics would make Destiny a desirable game to play. Now it's just menus and cards (Portal), content we paid for is gone for good, new locations are not that interesting and not worth visiting. When Destiny was ""not so good"", even Mercury were packed with players. 

Now i feel that i don't even need locations to go and that's one of the reasons that made me quit Destiny. You could just chill in IO, Titan, Mercury or Mars. You could chase the meta or just play the game the way you want. We had fun, now Bungie is a generic company.

I felt robbed when they sunsetted the content we paid for but i stuck cuz the narrative was good and we still had some uniqueness to the game. Now we don't.

Maybe i will come back one day and edit this, saying that they gave us back what we paid for, but i highly doubt and that just makes me sad, because i really miss the ""Journey"" that Destiny used to be (yeah, the feeling of the game and the best music they made)

If somehow they come back with what we deserve, i will be the first to be around. Until then, i will just reminisce on the good times i had and how used to be fun to just be playing Destiny outside the menus.",False,0,0,1764127564

Bungie should have walked away in 2020, while people were still applauding. But they insisted on milking it dry for profits and Pete Parsons very basic taste in classic cars.
I discovered Destiny in those years when Borderlands 2 had grown stale as yesterday's bread. And one boring day in school,  before me opened a pure greatness of game universe, that is a cathedral of a game design. A space western without tacky laser cowboys. Futuristic industrial design – sublime, functional, memorable – fused with magic that felt real and harked back to magic lore and mythology of our real world.
The first cracks on facade and mold in the basement appeared in Season 8. Patchnotes. ""Shake up the meta,"" they proclaimed, as if a hurricane in a china shop constitutes strategy. Massive damage nerfs to weapons and unique traits of armor.
Sunsetting... that was the moment when the roof caved in and walls began to bulge. They took our weapons – not just items, you see, but time made tangible. Hours of our lives, god rolls we treasured like family heirlooms... all discarded with a corporate smile about ""player experience.""
And then – slow rot. Content became faceless. Witch Queen briefly lit the old light in the windows, Final Shape reminded us what this building could have been... but the foundation was eaten through. No weapon felt meaningful. No activity – irreplaceable. Class building? A lick of a fresh paint on a bumpy hardwood floor and a new layer of a plaster on a bulged walls, that was carried out for too long, and amounted in too little result.
In 2018-2020 they gave us a cathedral. Magnificent. Singular. Then they buried that potential under layers of corporate incompetence and the paranoid fear of giving players too much.

The game is also full of quest bloat, which quickly becomes very tedious. The game would improve drastically if it wasn't full to the brim with ""I need you to deliver a pointless message to the person I'm standing right next to"" tasks.

The biggest grind of all is the walled content. The game lacks so many fundamentals that make an MMO great, such as sub-stat grinding and general farming. We all play them for the grind, the grind is a necessary characteristic of an MMO, but everything from farming to raiding is limited to a laughable daily/weekly limit which can only be alleviated by climbing over the paywall in one form or another. Even the bare basics, such as mining, logging, fishing, etc. is placed behind a cap... in an MMO. That's like playing Among Us, and the game says ""I'm sorry, you've completed too many tasks. Head to the store if you wish to continue."" There is no grind, only hinderance.

This WOULD be the greatest turn-based rpg I have EVER played.

WOULD. The truth though, is that this game stutters so badly and so frequently it is practically unplayable in Acts 2 and 3. Your game is going to be a little bit choppy in Act 1, worse in populated areas; you'll forgive it, because you're enjoying the story and game so much. Then Act 2 will come, and it will get worse. Cutscenes are now a choppy mess, character dialogue is constantly glitching out, so you're constantly pulled out of immersion. But you're invested at this point, so you sludge through the glitchiness to Act 3.

Then when your refund-window is LONG expired, and you're coming out of Act 2 finally on your way to Baldurs gate, and the truly performance-intensive areas are finally here... oh boy, it is bad. Non-stop stuttering, there is not one spoken word that isn't choppy, and the game truly becomes unplayable. I cannot believe a GOTY game performs like this.

The perforance is.. sad, the game struggles even on an RTX 3060 around medium settings at 1080p.

The file size is so overly bloated, it's rediclous.

Sometimes the world will take forever to properly load in(as in you can sometimes walk right out of the game world, or into an otherwise unnavagatable spot(like inside a boulder)).

Has terrible camera controls for vertical spaces.

Almost all the team mates are entirely unlikeable(I realise this is probably just a me thing).

Compared to other D&D games the character building is, just sad, it's been gutted so badly.

Level cap of 12, tells me it's unfinished.

A lot of spells and abilities even in those 12 levels worth are just missing.

One adult scene in particular(that you do have to go well out of your way for, and get plenty of warning, along with multiple chances to back out) isn't even legal in the US(thankfully I don't live there, but still worth mentioning)

Has a good number of missable quests,(as an example:  oh, you needed a rest, well too bad, this quest in a zone you haven't even gotten to yet failed, the child is dead, with nothing you can do about it other then start the whole game over) 

Mod implimentation is... bad... they should have just done the normal thing instead of, well, what they went with, Nexus may not be the most friendly of places, but it works properly far more often.

As I started with, it's probably not a bad game, but it's not a worthy sequal to Baulder's Gate II, the shift to turn based was a great idea, but the rest of it feels half baked in comparison.  I may get around to actually playing through what they bothered to make here someday, but for now, the file space is more valuable elsewhere used for programs that run at a decent rate.

You have missed the hype and most likely have already seen all of the spoilers. Either way, this game is better to watch anyway since the devs haven't updated the game since 2023 and that update was for the addition of MacOS players being able to play the game. I have a small feeling that the devs have abandoned this game which is sad since there are certain achievements that are now impossible to get due to certain areas having bugs where you simply either get soft-locked trying to enter them or can't enter them without somehow debugging if that is even possible (I'll get into those bugs later in this review). 

My personal opinion of this game is that it is amazing, it still seems to have an active community, it is cute as all hell and even funny at some parts, and the puzzles and story and interactions with the individual robots is just awesome. I love cats too :3

Anyway now, about the bugs: There is this weird bug in the game that affects three achievements. Those achievements being (from what I believe): Territory, Badges, and I Remember. The bug is where you just get stuck on certain parts of big pipes that you either walk on or through. I've had it to where it completely traps the character you play as forcing me to reload my save and I've had it to where it just blocks the character you play from progressing entirely.

If this game stopped being a roguelite, this would be so much better game. If either:
1) It added a checkpoint system every few levels so you don't have to start from the beginning again.
or, 2) It got rid of all upgrades and unlocked all abilites and weapons from the very start and ending this game was purely based on skill.

Either one of those and I would be actually playing the game to the end because it's such a cool game to play with especially on a handheld. In the current state I can only recommend it if you get someone's save file or a mod that does either of the above two things, otherwise I don't recommend any roguelite and that includes this game.

Roguelites have blown up in popularity but people have forgot how little dopamine hits every now and then can be really addicting and can really suck you in and just feels like you're progressing or having fun while inside your head, you're just agitated, nervous and fucking terrifed of dying in a video game.",False,1,1,1764040203
Hades,1145360,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Indie, RPG",76561197997838861,"Let's preface this simply by saying, I enjoyed my first 50 hours with this game. Interesting character dynamics, fun varied combat, challenging but satisfying combat, all around I enjoyed nearly all of that 50 hours; But you wanna know why I have an extra 30 hours? 

Achievement hunting, specifically ONE Achievement. Now, I'll be the bigger man and won't spoil what it was, but I'll explain a bit about this game's rouge-like element. Each of the games zones are made out of rooms. Combat, challenges, survive etc. There's a particular type of room called Encounter Rooms. They often give great benefits. Issue is, they're also bloody rare. You can go 10-20 runs without seeing one. To get 3 achievements, you need to find each of the 3 zones encounter rooms and that's not all. Some of these achievements can only be done AFTER finishing the prior one so if you low-ball cant get a certain encounter in a previous zone, you're SOOL for a while. 

Worse part is, you can customize the difficulty of your runs, you can make Zagreus stronger or weaker as you see fit, but all that pales to the sheer fact you cant control Encounter Rooms. It's literal RNG baked into the game. So you really can't cheese this outside letting the mobs kill you after wasting 15 minutes into a run.

Overall, Great game but the encounter rooms made it overstay its welcome. Won't immediately try out Hades 2 now its fully released But I hope they did fix this of all things.

If you have experience in roguelikes, you will probably NOT enjoy it. Don't buy it just because of the hype (it's a mystery).

Hades really puts the LITE in roguelite.

The art is great. It's the best part for me.

The story is... I don't know, I didn't finish it. Lore is given in tiny bits of dialogue after each run. While it's nice to have a lot of voiced lines, it's just too much filler. From what I've seen, there's not much intrigue either.

Gameplay gets boring after several hours. There are fixed room layouts with the same enemies, very little gameplay variation. The most you can do is try different builds, but they all function mostly the same (basic button mashing).
After completing one almost-full run, I just couldn't force myself to do it again. And from what I've heard, you have to do 10+ complete runs just to get the full story.

Honestly, I'm sick of everyone talking about roguelikes. It's my favourite game genre and Hades is kinda giving it a bad name.

It is a roguelite, so by nature it is grindy. Although in theory you can beat it at the first try, most players will play dozens of runs before beating the final boss and they will repeat even more for true endings, and unlockables.

However, Hades differences between runs feel  fairly minor. Updates are boring,  most of them are small improvements in health or damage,  poison vs critical damage, etc. Enemies feel to have too much life and need  plenty of button mashing. And unlock new things takes too many runs.

But! you may be thinking, didn't they patch it? Surely it's all fixed now right, why the hate?

To which I direct you to take-two's EULA for not just this game, but everything they have a hand in. Even in absentia of the horrific anti-consumer practices that gearbox themselves are guilty of going back as far as them embezzling funding from SEGA to use on their own projects, if you look at the EULA that Take-Two is now making mandatory on virtually all of their games you will find that they have declared for themselves the rights to access and collect the following information:

-Your name
-Your Email
-Your phone number
-Your photo
-Your mailing address/zip code
-payment or purchase info
-age
-gender

-platform ID
-Software products played

Furthermore, they also ""share"" (read:sell), your information with the following:

-Vendors that perform services and support for them

I realize that I'm going to most assuredly get flamed for daring to mention these things, likely by a bunch of addict lobotomites who are perfectly willing to sell their privacy, and any dignity or self-respect under the auspices that no one will actually come to collect on them personally, but as someone who purchased this game and played it for ages long before the IP was unceremoniously sold off and gutted by a company I despise due to their long history of abusing their customers, I cannot overstate how much I despise this entire series of events.

And yes, the truth is we're all trapped in this awful market environment, run roughshod over by corporate interests and information brokering thieves, but to have it so blatantly done to a game I loved, and considered one of the best in the genre? To see it literally become unplayable in a proper state for a year before they actually fixed things, and have everything unique and fun about it be dragged out and abused for all it's worth by unscrupulous corporate asshairs who couldn't give a shit less about something that was until that point, crowd funded and beloved by its community? It's like purchasing a car and then a decade later the company changes hands and they break into your house and reengineer every part of your vehicle to function worse so they can sell you back the parts they just stole from you. We aren't renters, we are owners of these things, at least we damn well should be for the amount of money we pay for these products. Enough is enough.

I cannot, and will not support this, and I say if you have any respect for yourself or what this game was before they infested it, cut them off. Let something new take its place someday, and God willing let that indie dev not decide to sell out their baby to the devil.",False,1,0,1764143256

Dead Cells is a masterclass in tight, fluid combat and procedural design. From the very first run, the game hooks you with its fast-paced movement, responsive controls, and endless surprises around every corner. Every level feels alive, challenging, and meticulously crafted, keeping you on your toes while rewarding skill and experimentation.

Combat is both satisfying and strategic. Whether you’re slashing with swords, raining arrows from a distance, or experimenting with magical abilities, every encounter demands quick thinking and adaptability. The variety of weapons, abilities, and power-ups ensures no two runs feel the same, making every death feel like a learning experience rather than a setback.

The procedural levels are beautifully designed, blending consistency with unpredictability. You’ll explore sprawling castles, perilous biomes, and hidden areas, all teeming with enemies, secrets, and loot. Each run is a fresh challenge, keeping the game endlessly replayable.

Progression is rewarding and fair. Unlocking new weapons, mutations, and abilities encourages experimentation and creates a sense of growth across multiple runs. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and satisfaction, making every victory feel earned.

Visually, Dead Cells is stunning. Pixel art meets fluid animation in a style that’s both retro and modern. Coupled with an energetic soundtrack, the game’s atmosphere feels tense, vibrant, and utterly alive.

Final Verdict:
Dead Cells is a thrilling roguelike that combines fluid combat, clever design, and endless replayability. Challenging, rewarding, and endlessly fun, it’s a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed platformers and roguelikes.

“Fast, fluid, and endlessly rewarding — Dead Cells proves that roguelikes can be both challenging and exhilarating.”

It is a Rogue game. If you are someone that likes making progress in your games, values a story or actually progressing while playing, look the other way. This genre is terrible if any of the above things matter to you at all.

If however, you enjoy playing the same section of a game over and over again with no save points, no checkpoints, and the smallest mistake forces you to lose everything and do it all over again, this is a game for you!

Dead Cells,588650,24.99,0,solo,"Action, Adventure, Indie",76561199278354979,"The most overrated roguelite of all time and it's not even close. I'm not sure what it is, I don't understand why, but I feel like this game gets tons of praise that I just don't get. I won't deny visually the game is definitely pretty to look at, but it doesn't really stand out much to me. Not much in this game stands out to me. Tons of cosmetics, tons of weapons, tons of utilities, tons of unlocks, tons of additional things you can get too like bombs or traps; it almost feels, dare I say, bloated. To me personally. But I wonder, why do I love having a ton of unlocks in games like Tboi or Ror2, but with this game I don't care for some reason? I think there may just be something in the core of this game that I don't like.

Some things I just straight up don't like: Level progression. This game's progression across levels feels so, so painfully muddled, and nonlinear. This could be something that very well might be fixed after playing the game for long enough, but dude, it's been 29, almost 30 hours of playtime as of right now. Why do I still not understand how I'm getting to like 70% of the levels I'm in. You start at level 1, then there's the two different level 2's, and then around each of those there's like 5 more levels that, I'm gonna be real, I can't even tell if they're actual main levels or just alternate areas. What the fuck is happening. I've probably been to like 10 different areas in the game so far. If you put a million dollars on the line, and put me in 7 of those areas and asked me ""Where are you in the game right now?"", I still could not give you a straight answer. It's just very needlessly over complicated.

I never cared too much for the combat either. I try to block enemies, but parry timing doesn't feel right that often. This could very well be a me thing but combat just feels very clunky, ESPECIALLY in the later levels when there's more enemies that have more complex and unpredictable attacks that are additionally sometimes stacked on top of each other. It's not the type of thing where enemies take turns either, shit will just attack you and that makes parrying so much harder. On top of this at the end of each level you have one mutation to pick, from a list of like 50+. It's just numbers. It's just a bunch of numbers, more damage when you do this, blocking does this, this ranged stuff is a little better, nothing stands out. It just all feels so lame and not unique or impactful enough at all. That's how a lot of stuff in this game feels for me, just a lot of Quantity > Quality, honestly.

If it sounds like I'm hating just to hate, I definitely get that don't get me wrong, but believe me, I'm not. I am STILL, from time and time again, coming back to this game and playing it for a bit, just to see if something sticks. As of right now though nothing has really grabbed my attention too much from this game. Nothing specific from it has made me truly yearn to come back to it, like a really cool weapon or gimmick or something. I'm just trying to find SOMETHING here, okay? I'm really trying, I promise. I see this game get a lot of positive reception, I want to understand it. This game's probably a better metroidvania than a roguelite honestly, and if that's your jam then that's awesome, dude. I may just not be that big of a fan of metroidvanias. As a big roguelite guy I wouldn't personally recommend it but that's just from my own personal taste.

This is stupid but I have to add this: Guys. This is the year 2025, and we STILL don't have options for adjusting the graphics in our game? Are we actually serious? This game just started running terribly for me as I've been trying to play it again now, with the same computer and everything, and I can't change fps or graphics or anything. I forgot but, I guess it is hard to advance past the prestigious, high-end computer technology of the late 90's. That is fucking INSANE, just ridiculous.

- if too many enemy's are being hit by your attacks, a few may be ignored and freely attack you

- Weapon drop RNG needs refreshed as I'm getting drops for weapons I never use or don't work for upcoming levels.

Maybe a bit overhyped. 
_________________

Main issue: 
even with lot of stuff to unlock the runs don´t feel like you are making progress at all or you make a real impact. 

You have like 3 classes which make different items /skills better - but there is less difference.
I mean c´mon, who cares if your turret shoots flames, canonballs or arrows. 
Same to e.g. swords, daggers - they just have like 3 attack patterns while hitting the smash button. 
You can hook, you can kick - that´s almost the highlights here. 

Don´t get me wrong: You CAN parry with a shield. There is variety (ice bow, explosions,...). But you carry (mostly) 2 weapons, 2 skills. And you will exchange them, due to ""level"" of items. Use & exchange w/ new one.
I´d have liked a ""upgrade your character"" thing, to really create a lasting build. 

You have 3 ""passive options"" to choose per run. To really make a difference this restriction is pain. 
Compare binding of isaac - you got tons of passive items, which also stack. Not here.
So don´t expect really awesome combos...

Bosses will get repetitive. Yes they get stronger and have different move sets while you make progress - they still feel the same. 
Maybe this is also because of the plain story... There is also no real benefit they provide for the run while defeating them. 

There is lot to like: in my case especially the art style, humor and references to other games.
But I was expecting something different.

The intro were so effing long I had to go into the game folder and delete those darn three videos and you should do the same if you don't want to spent an hour long watching that shjt when you first start the game.

Slow pace, so much walking. There are literally 10 more badass soldier on the train and I have to do all the work for them, alone, make no sense. And my chick and her sugar daddy keep yelling at each other all the time.

NPCs talk a lot and continuously, and argue endlessly, one person hasn't finished speaking yet and the other has already jumped in and yelling. The English dub is really bad, cringe and tense with a weird accent, I had to switch to Russian dub to listen to it less annoying.

Annoying buzzing sound (on my watch I guess) really drive me crazy!! WTF what that? Idk if it is a bug/glitch or game's feature but I can not stand it any second. F that sheat!

One thing that seemed really cool at first but turned out to be really ridiculous was the sound effects, for example when an NPC was talking, I was standing right in front of them but when I turned the camera left/right/behind I couldn't hear them anymore, it was funny and ridiculous.

The requirements for a perfect clearing of the levels fail to trigger making a perfect game a crap shoot; you fail stealth sections without any alerted enemies

every weapon you get sucks and the level clear penalty for your material makes upgrading weapons a chore

the exploration is as shallow as can be and literally crap compared to shovelware like ""mad max"" (mad max is a bad game but at least it DOESNT PENALIZE YOU FOR THE SCRAP YOU COLLECT EVERY TIME YOU CLEAR A REGION FOR ""REPAIRS"")

The enemies are bullet sponges and playing on any difficulty higher than normal is just garbage. they shoot you from across the map in fog you cant see through then take several shots to the hear AFTER THEIR HELMET AND MASK FLY OFF

I dont remember this game sucking that bad at launch and didnt review it but holy crap i cant recommend this game at all. just read the books, its sad that all of the metro games suck but they changes this to play more like stalker. like i seriously just want to wander in the wastes and collect trinkets and shoot the occasional skag/hostile scavenger, this is all just artificially difficult to pad out playtime. i remember how short this crap is and on my current playthrough i havent even stolen the strain yet and ive died 30+ times. 

Do not buy this game and if you do play it on normal bc its just trying to pass the 2 hour refund deadline; NOTHING you do in the rest of the game minus that stupid gas filled tunnel on the third map are as hard as this horrible intro. like they have seriously made the intro as bad as atomic hearts for some reason.

Lethal Company throws players into a darkly comedic sci-fi world where you and your crew of unfortunate contractors are sent to abandoned industrial moons to salvage scrap for a ruthless megacorporation. What starts as a simple job quickly spirals into a tense, unpredictable experience as every mission risks becoming your last.

The game shines in its cooperative gameplay and emergent chaos. Working together to explore derelict facilities, avoid traps, and carry loot back to the ship creates constant tension—especially when creatures begin stalking the halls. Communication, quick thinking, and teamwork determine whether you escape alive or become yet another “unfortunate loss” on the company ledger.

The progression loop is simple but addictive. Collect scrap, sell it, buy better gear, and take on more dangerous environments. Each moon offers unique layouts, hazards, and threats, making every run feel fresh. The randomness of enemy encounters and environmental quirks adds to the thrill and unpredictability.

Atmosphere is one of the game’s biggest strengths. The dim lighting, eerie soundscapes, and unsettling creature designs create an environment that’s equal parts scary and hilarious—especially when panic sets in and everything falls apart. The blend of horror and humor gives the game a unique charm that keeps players coming back.

Final Verdict:
Lethal Company delivers a perfect mix of tension, teamwork, and unpredictable fun. Whether you're playing seriously or embracing the chaos, it’s an endlessly entertaining co-op experience filled with memorable moments and dark humor.

“Terrifying, chaotic, and ridiculously fun—clock in, survive, and hope the Company approves.”

HELLDIVERS 2,553850,31.99,17,multiplayer/co-op,Action,76561198108256612,"As a massive fan of the original game, I do not like the sequel. It feels like less of a co-op game and more of a ""everyone split up and do their own thing"" kind of game because the game is designed in ways that punish you for wanting to stay together with your teammates so it just feels heavily discouraged. Enemy spawns struggle to split between 4 players in different parts of the map so it results in the hardest difficulty feeling hilariously easy at times when one or more people barely get any spawns and just freely do objectives, but if you stay together you all get all the enemies spawns pretty much all the time which just ends up wasting so much time.

Helldivers 1 was built, designed, and balanced a lot around co-op centric things, your team had far more reason to have different roles and loadouts instead of making a strong versatile build that can do everything independently, team reload mechanic was a much stronger and encouraged mechanic, and the team was not allowed to be separated.

A lot of strategems and weapons also just feel worse than the HD1 counterparts in terms of damage, ammo economy, and general effectiveness. The standard Breaker shotgun and the Kinetic Shield are some of the worst offenders to me.

HD2 also lacks some crucial teamwork focused strategems that people like me desperately want back, such as the Rep-80 heal beam gun, or the Angel Guard dog medical backpack. The stim pistol was not a fun addition to the game as trying to hit people with that is insufferable, I don't care if people say it's skill issue, it is not fun, and not like it's very effective anyway cause players tend to die faster than it can heal anyway.

Player survivability in HD2 also just does not feel as fair or as fun as HD1 too. The incap system was completely removed so you just outright die (Gives another less incentive to use SMG's compared to HD1, hell you can't even carry artillery shells with one hand and shoot a one handed weapon at the same time anymore either), and weak enemies can even kill you in just a mere few hits sometimes. The games survivability relying so much on stims is not particularly a design choice I like either. I wish they kept the incap system and players being a bit tankier, and you had very very slow health regen instead if you arn't taking damage. (Stims should of been something in the grenade slot instead to replace grenades in my opinion.)

I don't like how armor went from a cosmetic only thing in HD1 so you could wear what you want and select the perk you wanted separately, to now armor passives have to be handcuffed to armors that I don't want to wear while the ones I want to wear have awful passives or ones I really don't want to use cause it won't complement my build. Which is rather annoying.

Performance and game stability is also not particularly great either. This game used to run well on my system early on but after a bunch of updates it feels like it really struggles to be stable, I know they started trying to address this though it's still not anywhere near how well the game used to run yet. (I acknowledge more major engine tech stuff may take time, but felt I'd mention this.)

I donno, maybe it's a hot take, but I do not like this game because it took away the biggest thing I praised the original for and that's feeling like a true co-op designed experience first and foremost, where lone wolf gameplay was actively discouraged. I don't like some of the other design decisions/changes too. I'd only recommend this game if you are okay with it being nothing like the original game, the game itself isn't terrible, but as an original fan it feels too alienating for me, like it was catoring to a completely different audience for the sake of being mainstream. 

There's a lot more I'm probably forgetting off the top of my head right now, so I'll end it with this. TLDR: I wish this game just tried to be more like HD1 in almost all aspects but with the third person perspective change and with more content/features, not drastically change or redesign things that worked just fine before.",False,2,0,1764159083

Playing with my friends was a blast as we tried many different combinations and weapons to tackle bugs, bots, and otherwise. While the game was fun in the beginning, the game now feels like a slog or chore. The personal secondary objectives to get medals used to be ""Use X gun for Y kills"" or ""Use an airstrike or sentry gun for Y kills."" Now it's always ""Collect samples"" or ""Evac 3 times from a faction-specific map."" The major orders follow suit with them just being ""Hold planet Z because why not?""

The samples I've collected have been in my inventory for over a year now; having upgraded my personal ship to the maximum, I don't think there will be any personal ship upgrades in the future or at all. 

The enemies are slanted towards the bugs last time I played, with them having numerous updates/upgrades from invisibility to flying acid dragons and fog-spewing chargers, while the bots do have different types of the flamethrower variety. It would be pretty cool if they had ships dispersing fog or invisible patrols or had fighting styles like the Illuminate.

The scope of the game has stretched it so thin, and despite some amazing work from the art team, including the sweet OST by Donglekumquat, it wastes so much of its effort on creating games that are destined to go unplayed, or forever be half-baked.

For a social game, Tower Unite is really bad at incentivising being social, and that is no more apparent than in the highly popular casino, where about half the lobby will be pressing their space bar for hours on end at the slots, while the adjacent poker hall, a game perfect for social interactions with strangers, sits empty. The Arcade is full of minigames, yet only a handful of the 20+ are even multiplayer, and the ones that really payout are once again just mindnumbingly pressing the space bar for hours on end. 
The game's poor balancing of rewards can encourage players to be antisocial.

Tower Unite is capable of putting out genuinely great games, I would still hold its Minigolf as one of the best out there, and you can easily lose yourself in its condo system for hours with how much possibility it has, but so much of its development has gone towards things that are pointless, games that are buggy, unbalanced, or simply lack the demand. 

A social game doesn't demand a weak quake imitator requiring years of development when most of its other features are still incomplete. 
Something as simple as checkers can bring strangers to socialise, and Tower Unite really needed more things like that, simple ways for strangers to be brought together, and I think in its tunnel vision to check off Kickstarter promises they forgot that that was the most important part of the game's concept.",False,1,0,1764114083

The moderation team consists of the owner who defends a prominent pedophile. The community will do anything to get you banned if any of your views do not agree with theirs, especially gay crap. Even if you avoid the bad side of Tu's community they'll stalk you and do anything they can to remove you from their game if they find out anything about you doesn't agree with them.

The most depressing reason I do not recommend this game is because of the degeneracy allowed to seep through the cracks of private condos/player homes that the game gives you. Yes you are free to build whatever you want however you want with the awesome features of workshop and canvases. Unfortunately these canvases are not moderated in any way. Players are allowed to post all kinds of porn in their condos and some condos have cp. There are r-18 tags but the players are so degen that they wont turn their tags on and don't get punished for not following the rules and I still come across porn with the tags hidden in the settings. If you post anything right wing or Christian-like you will get banned.
I submitted a ticket to fix a feature where you can join off your friend's list without seeing tags or condo ownership and that got overshadowed by a Halloween update which sucks because if you join through a friend and they are in a fetish condo and you do not know that they are in there, you won't see beforehand what you are joining into which I have unfortunately seen by joining a friend I just added on the game.

Don't support this game's echo chamber and hive mind/mob mentality. 
Initially starting out on this game I was impressed by the creative capabilities with condos and the amount of activities you could do with friends, so much so that I purchased one of the supporter packs. I'm a pretty reserved person so I don't speak up too often but after playing for a while in the plaza with my friends I began to notice the same kinds of people coming on making inflammatory statements, sexual comments, and just downright degeneracy. Then you look at their Steam profiles and see that many of those who frequent this game are SEVERELY detached from society, mentally unwell, and/or promote unhealthy things (like ""consensual"" sexual content with those who are underage). They seem to go by a ""we don't take care of things unless they're reported"" mentality unless you're speaking out against their hypocrisy, THAT is when you get some kind of ban as I have seen and heard of from many players, friend and not. They claim to defend against things like bigotry and certain figures so they can use those things as a blanket statement to silence what they don't agree with. I had a friend having a proper cordial discussion with a trans individual about how we should help take care of the trans community's mental health when they're young instead of just thrusting them onto HRT when someone came up and started harassing my friend, yelling over them, making load noises with items, and acting like my friend was being transphobic (they certainly are not and stated such several times). Evidently, after those 2 individuals went off to ""chat"" my friend was banned the very next day for HARASSING after never receiving so much as a warning prior to this. I can go into even more detail on other instances of inappropriate moderation but this review is already long enough and I'm honestly done with this game.",False,34,3,1760948030

There's multiple reports of CSAM/CP in condos (in reviews on Steam here, and claims/reports of users encountering it) and it has also been reported to Valve to delist the game. 
For asking what will be done regarding this problem since there's multiple reports (on Steam reviews & others spoken with); me & others get permanetely voice/text banned in game and within the social media such as discord.

This is not how you moderate your own product. If you do not have enough staff to moderate it, that is the companies fault for not being prepared and or properly staffed. It is a similar situation as to what's happening with Roblox for harboring predators as they have been taken to court for similar/same reasons.
There are minors that play this game at times, if you can't have the proper moderation for your product when there's reports of CP, it needs to shut down & or you need to have many more moderators, especially in game. It may be said they take this seriously, but yet it's a problem that keeps happening when it shouldn't as people still report this as a serious problem.
There should not be a single claim and or report of any predators on the platform. That is the fault of the company. In this case PixelTail, who should know better. I did not know how much of a problem this game had until only recently, when I first started playing this game a few years ago I did not know about these serious problems. The developers are their own moderators from what I read, which is not enough. They need an active moderation team in game and on the socials.
It is very strange that the community itself treats this as a joke, marking this review as funny. That's not normal and it only makes PixelTail look worse. That raises suspicions. only ones who would joke about a serious issue like this, may be predators themselves. Other games like vrchat are part of this problem too (which they've been notified with evidence multiple times by users). Some people need to have common sense as well, just because you have not seen something doesn't mean it doesn't happen. There's multiple reports of these problems by users for a reason.

I love this game and I love the interactions and conversations I've had through it. Do I recommend this game? No. Do I regret buying it, and the supporter packs? No. I have not and do not support Pixeltail through their Patreon. [strike]I will probably continue playing it since I have friends I introduced to it and I do enjoy condo building.[/strike] After having thought about it for a while, I won't be. There's no fixing this.[/b]

[h1]Gaming Time[/h1]

I think this game is horribly mismanaged. I'm not a game dev, I don't have any experience managing a company or studio. I also don't believe that any dev should take their community suggestions one to one and implement them full stop, it's their game and I respect that, but this game doesn't respect your time. I play all sorts of games, and I enjoy a good grind. In a game like Tower Unite, isn't the focus suppose to be on hanging out with people and making memories?

If you don't know, as it is with the current Halloween event you get a coin every 5 minutes, if you're actively playing a game that's not in the Casino or Condo- you must be the Plaza playing an plaza minigame, the Arcade, one of the game worlds (these are rewarded upon completion, so example, 5 days of Zombie Massacre + Boss) or you can earn them through Fishing, which isn't on a timer but is a percentage chance to drop. The best way to grind these are by Fishing and playing one game every 5 minutes. You can get coins from other activities, such as the Remains or Trick or Treat buckets, but those are also a percentage chance and on their own event timers.

If you want one Potted Carnivorous Plant, it costs 25 Ghoul Coins, which is 125 minutes, or 2 hours, spent so long as you're actively getting coins every 5 minutes exactly. This doesn't take into consideration that as of writing the backend for rewarding coins and other drops is bugged and the timer can be skewed. That is one copy of this condo item, and you cannot duplicate it without having multiple. Going off someone else's math, which has been consistent for the past 6 years I have played this game, if you want to buy one of everything, you'll need 328 coins or a minimum of 27 hours of just coin grinding. But we'll be fair and say you don't want or need everything, not everyone does.

Thing is, this is not just a holiday event issue. Usually you think of holidays as fun and rewarding, a distraction for people to get together and celebrate, but this is how the game is normally. Zombie Massacre, considering that you're playing solo and the meta, will take 15-20 minutes to earn roughly 30k units based on performance. If I go to the Casino and I play the horse betting game called Silver Saddles, I can bet 100k and make a minimum profit of that same 30k in what, 3-5 minutes tops? That's on the low end, a minimum total of 130k every game. This is considered an exploit. If you're an active condo builder who likes building with detail, 1 mil units is a drop in the bucket. Everything in Tower Unite has and will be funneled to the condo, unless you treat it like a party game to occasionally play with friends, which is perfectly fine too. Problem is, it is treated and advertised as the latter when the game is built with the former in mind, and not equally.

[h1]Social Hour[/h1]

A lot of people have and will continue to (rightfully) complain about the community. Yes, you have a wide breadth of people from all kinds of creeds and origins that will join a social game. Why anyone is suprised by that is beyond me, an individuals actions is what should be judged, not the individual or a generalized group. My problem comes with the fact that moderation in Tower Unite is negligble at best, straight up absent at it's worse. I'm also of the belief that a more laxed approach should be taken, and more users should use the Ignore/Mute and Block options that exists in games. Does that mean I am okay with the slurs, bigotry, harassment, and many other vile hatred statements that are spewed in this game? No. I just think for the most part that a lot of arguments can be handled like adults and most, including myself, are quick to anger and hatred.

Recently, there has been someone with an extensive track record of getting muted and banned for all sorts of reasons spamming a Discord link in the Global chat which can be seen by everyone in plazas, minigames, and condos as well as the main menu. Normally that's just a rule break, no advertising and solicitation? My problem with it is that it was a Discord link being advertised with another url that leads to a website advertising said Discord which has a focus on NSFW/Porn/Adult themes and sharing. Am I some sort of pearl clutching prude who hates the idea of adults enjoying themselves? No. Take one look at my profile. My problem is that it was being advertised in the Global chat and that person only got a 24 hour text chat ban, in a game that is not explicitly for adults, that allows children, teenagers, and vulnernable adults amongst each other. Some might mention the existence of Mature condos that feature similar imagery and chatting, but you need to explicitly turn on a setting to view those and it is not enabled by default. Global chat is on by default. Take Roblox as a better example of this kind of behavior and where it's getting them.

I'm not asking for the devs who are also the moderation team to be awake 24/7 and constantly monitoring the chat, nor am I asking for them to setup some kind of age verification or AI chat tool that'll constantly scan the chat. My solution? Get a moderation team. Problem with it? It's been asked and people have actively stepped up to say they will be a moderator. This and along with repeated harassment reports is completely normal behavior for most. This game doesn't have thousands of players, you see the same faces. The punishment does not fit the crime.

That is one incident that I didn't even fully cover, there are plenty of others, its an iceberg. And before I get asked ""did you report"", yes, I have reported people. Problem is, despite reporting, should I rely on a report, which might not be seen for several hours, for someone advertising adult servers, someone else doxxing, another hosting CSAM content? Why isn't there an active moderation team for a game thats active at all hours and allow you to run free?

[h1]More Questions[/h1]

I'm not someone who underestimates the time and patience it takes to not only develop a game, especially with the scope and scale that this game has. I have defended Pixeltail in the past, just like I have defended other games and studios, when I think they deserve it. I don't expect updates to come weekly, I don't expect anyone on to cater to me or anyone else. I also can't say I don't hesitate to make suggestions I know will be ignored. I'm not going to villainize Pixeltail.

It still does put into question why 1.0 released as rushed as it did. Why the Cats and Dogs update had a pack of dogs from an asset store, that wasn't even the full package, but one you can get through a pirated direct download. Why do you still need to spend so many hours to buy one silly little background for your profile that will only ever been seen by someone opening the scoreboard. Why there is so much going against you trying to have fun, from the backend that keeps track of of your inventory being bugged, to the chugging of servers past at 32/64 players, why an ingame Casino is more worth your time grinding than playing a game with your friends. Why are so many people allowed to get away with a slap on the wrist for such disgusting words and actions?

I was not a GMT (Garrys Mod Tower/GM Tower) player. I'm only speaking on recent feelings as of this year and the past few I've played.

Spent a lot time building in this game, that was pretty fun, built a town and set up all kinds of contraptions, personally wasn't interested in much else the game had to offer as I could always find a better alternative on the steam marketplace. the concept is cool, and the devs are just doing their thing so I wouldn't really throw them under the bus or anything.  I can see why people really enjoy this game but after spending a couple hundred hours, I have found myself exhausted with what the game has to offer and perhaps a bit disenchanted.  I personally wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, there are better alternatives out there.  (trying my best not to flame and be straightforward with this)  EDIT: also, like many many people have stated there is a serious issue of user shared content in this game,I won't single anyone out or throw any groups of people under the bus but you should know anyone can post whatever they want and so as long as you simply state ""18+"" you are able to get away with sharing some pretty wicked stuff. so that feature comes with all the pros and cons of being able to share content in a public space, it's moderated yeah, but many things slip between the cracks like all public forums. The team will say they do their best to moderate but you will usually still find something totally shocking and it's usually on you for agreeing to enter an 18+ condo in the first place, which is just kind of a funny rule that is constantly bent.

By shifting to a first-person perspective, the game plunges players directly into the claustrophobic and unsettling world of the Baker family, delivering an intensity and immersion rarely seen in horror games.

The atmosphere is pitch-perfect: every creaking floorboard, shadowy hallway, and grotesque detail contributes to a constant sense of dread. The game’s visuals and sound design are exceptional, combining to make even familiar settings feel deeply menacing.

Gameplay emphasizes survival and careful strategy. Ammo and resources are scarce, forcing players to think before they act and heightening the tension of every encounter. Puzzles and exploration are intelligently designed, rewarding curiosity while maintaining a constant sense of vulnerability.

The story is gripping and horrifying, blending psychological terror with body horror in a way that feels fresh yet unmistakably Resident Evil. The Baker family, particularly Jack Baker, are unforgettable antagonists whose presence keeps players on edge throughout.

Overall, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard revitalizes the franchise with a terrifying, immersive experience that balances horror, story, and gameplay flawlessly. It’s a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers seeking a true survival horror thrill.

I didn’t walk into that house to be a hero.
I just wanted her back.
That was my first mistake.

Nothing prepares you for the Bakers. No horror movie, no nightmare, no childhood fear. They don’t just attack you — they claim you. Jack speaks to you like you’re already family. Marguerite feeds you like she wants you to rot properly. Lucas watches you break and laughs because he knows he’s already won.

Every time I healed, the pain returned differently.
Every time I lost part of myself, something else grew in its place.
The house learned me.
Room by room. Breath by breath.

And the worst part? A part of me understood it. The mold doesn’t lie. It shows you exactly what you’re made of — usually blood, panic, and very bad decisions.

The DLCs feel like the memories I tried hardest to bury. Fragments, regrets, things I didn’t want to relive but kept resurfacing like the swamp water in my lungs. Some offered closure. Some reopened wounds that never had time to close.

I survived.
But survival feels like a technicality.

Rising Storm 2 Vietnam,418370,19.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561199262235522,"Growing up in the early 2000's, Resident Evil was a series I was familiar with but never played. I didn't care for the horror genre, and the games seemed really creepy to me. Recently I decided to try something new and buy this game along with Resident Evil VIII in a combo package for $20. This game had good reviews, and I didn't want to spoil anything so I went in blind. Minor spoilers ahead.

The build up to this game was good, and the first 20mins set the scene well. You're looking for your fiance that disappeared 3yrs ago because she recently contacted you with her location. You drive to a desolate swamp in Louisiana and find an abandoned house and shack. At this point the game started getting really creepy, and I enjoyed how it was building up. It reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You find your fiance locked up in the basement. Turns out she's been possessed by something. She attacks you with a knife and you defend yourself with your bare hands. She stabs right through your hand and I was like ""oh shit..."". About 10secs later your pour hydrogen peroxide on the wound and it magically heals up. Really? This immediately killed the immersion for me. 2mins later, your SAME hand gets stabbed again. Then it gets cut off by a chainsaw. At that point I was like ""Oh SHIT!"". You get a pistol and somehow reload the gun while holding the gun with your only hand. It made very little sense. I'm not kidding, about 2mins later, your hand gets stapled back on like nothing happened. This was like a slap in the face. I always thought these games were more realistic. Sure they have monsters and zombies, but I didn't know the main character was a fucking super human. To make things worse, I got stuck right after the dinner scene and didn't know where to go. I was already bored so I let the psycho kill me. He hit me about 10-15 times, and I'm playing on normal difficulty. I plan on finishing this game, but my expectations are pretty low at this point. Hopefully as I continue this play through my thoughts will change.",False,3,7,1762108900

I've tried so much to like it, but I get bored and cannot come to terms with the limited gameplay, even though there's so much customization with different weapons, skills and attribute combinations.

The game world lacks soul, even though everybody says that there's a very engaging main story with plot twists, which I cannot find the courage to follow because of the boring gameplay.

I used to love old JRPGS on SNES and PSX, but there was the perceived freedom that you were in an open world. This game just throws you in a PS2-like linear minimap that you have to navigate and inevitably come across a minimap boss that looks like it's come from the Dark Souls series.

Where it falls short is the actual gameplay and mechanics. It's uninspired and boring. When you learn to dodge and parry, then every battle or confrontation becomes painfully mundane. I found myself only doing the battles I needed to just to move the story along so I could watch the movie. This could be a great movie when it comes out.

I am high-functionally autistic, so I prefer turn-based games over real-time action because my reactions are kinda … slow.
I can manage to survive many real-time action games in „story“/„easy“ mode, so we are not talking about pathological impairments here.
I WILL keep the game, and I so much WANT to love it for its deep story and beautiful art design, but there is one complaint I need to state here as an official bug report or feature request - WHEN I SET EASIEST STORY MODE, I WANT A FAIR EASY STORY MODE!!!
LOWER THE DODGE/PARRYING TIMINGS ASAP! 
IF PLAYERS WANT CHALLENGING TIMINGS, THEY DON‘T CHOOSE STORY MODE!

I am very much willing to totally twist around my review to thumbs up and praise if you are so kind to reach out to me and/or somehow reconsider your choice in quicktime timings and hardness to be more inclusive for those who are not just „too lazy to get good“, but at a weaker point at all. Why must games be so hard in general without including additional customers (more than you might think?) to also be served with a great game?
I am willing to practice and learn, but within my personal comfort zone and capabilities.
If there is a story mode, make it a fair story mode, not a 1% less super-hard-mode, in my very personal opinion, this is almost false advertising at its finest.
PLEASY, MAKE IT SUPER HARD FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE HARD MODE, 
You can design achievements only for those playing harder modes, I am with you, or give more or less XP in-game for harder play styles, but please don‘t exclude players that are just more casual or even have some limits. Your game is pretty, packed with story and emotion, why exclude such a wide range of players from enjoying it?

The reason for this seems to be some kind of moral system whereby if you moral drops to zero it's as good as dying, only you can heal health and avoid fights, but you cannot avoid skill checks, unless you just want to remain in your hotel room and go nowhere and do nothing.

Full Review:
This isn't a game for people who've been through certain types of trauma. Namely, trauma having to do with your self esteem and value. First of all, you do NOT get to customize a character. One is given to you and he's already a psychological mess. If you have deep wells of empathy this game will trigger you in a way that is more harmful than good. The overall message is for people who haven't yet developed the skills or life experience to understand the illusion of choice is not freedom. It's a game with a very dark, nihilistic message. While Nihilism can be enlightening and even freeing for some people, this game doesn't really allow you to explore those aspects of it. It tends to repeatedly highlight only the worse parts of humanity in a context absent of hope or empathy. Why the devs would include an entire segment of dialogue that analyzes and breaks down racism in support of it, is a confusing and concerning choice. There are better ways of exposing how toxic racism is without glorifying at the same time. The game is definitely thought provoking but it does it in a very abusive manner that could be harmful to people who struggle with CPTSD, AuDHD and healthy emotional regulation. 
This game shook me because I've already learned the darker lessons and hard truths life ultimately teaches you. I didn't need a rerun of trauma and I think the lessons could be learned without it, but I understand why some people feel it's necessary. It might be a great game, but it's not for everybody and that's why I can't recommend it.",False,2,3,1763665357

Sea of Stars,1449850,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",76561198877995722,"I decided to write this review since I see a lot of people have a rough time with the entry barrier into Master Duel. 

Master Duel is described by Konami as the place where you will duel at the highest level and when they say highest level they are not downplaying it. First things you need to be aware of is that yes there is a barrier when you start playing that at first might seem overwhelming, but you need to remember you are jumping at the deep-end of the Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling experience. Some people criticize Master Duel for not being beginner friendly, and although I do agree there is a curve to adapt to in terms of dueling, specially for people who are returning to Yu-Gi-Oh after many years away or people who have only watched the anime or who are experiencing the brand for the first time, I also think the game gives you the tools so that you are able to build a strong deck very early into the game. 

Chances are yes you are going to get whooped during your first couple of duels, but that is to be expected since you are at the first steps of your deck building but if you put your time to learn the ins and outs of the game, it is a great way to enjoy the franchise. 

Some useful things things for people willing to give it a shot:
- Master Duel is very very F2P friendly, the game gives you so many easy ways to get gems (the currency used for opening packs) and occasionally even give you full structure-decks through things like friend code referral and such. If you manage your gems correctly you can easily make a viable competitive deck in just a few minutes and can probably average a new deck every month or so.

- Do your tutorials (skip them if you have a basic understanding of the game) and after, when picking one of the 3 beginners decks, just pick the one that matches your latest understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! 

- Before entering ranked matches, go to solo mode and there you will find many ""missions"" that reward you with cosmetics such as mates, duel fields, sleeves and even some actual card, but most importantly finishing the Duel Strategy missions reward you with a total of 2,400 gems. By doing solo mode not only can you unlock different rewards but you will also fulfill some of the challenges and missions that reward you with even more gems. 

- Now when it comes to currencies we have gems which are used to open card packs and just buy anything from the store and you also have crafting points (CP) ranging from Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare points. These CP are used to craft cards individually which is helpful if the card you are looking for is not available on any dedicated pack or if you only need to craft 1 copy of that card. In principle crafting a card take 30 CP regardless of the rarity (and when crafting there is a random chance of it being one of three different types of foiling which basically just means how shiny the card will be). Then some cards you don't want can be dismantled into CP of the corresponding rarity of the card going from 10 - 30 CP depending on the foiling of the card dismantled. One thing to note with CP is that not all cards can be dismantled as some free cards you get wont be able to be dismantled, but every card from pack openings can be dismantled into CP (cards from structure decks can't be dismantled tho). Best tip is to spend your SR CP and UR CP wisely and only when you really want or need a card since they are the hardest points to gather at first.

- Now before building a deck, opening packs and crafting cards you need to ask yourself the most important question when joining Master Duel for the first time - Which deck do you want to play with? - This is the most important decision you will have to make since the deck you chose will be your partner for the first month or so, so more than a meta deck just go for the one you will have the most fun with.

- Once you know which deck you want to go with, the best thing to do is to just create a deck and add all the cards you will want in it, that way you will know which cards you have, which cards you are missing and their respective rarities. Then you have to best options, one of them is to take one SR or UR card from that archetype and craft it, in doing so you will unlock a secret pack from that archetype which then you can spend your gems opening packs to get cards from that archetype. You can also go into the store and look at the structure decks and see if the archetype you want is available there, that way by spending 500 gems you will get access to the core of the archetype and can be a shortcut to building your desired deck.

- 2 PRO TIPS when it comes to gems are NEVER SPEND GEMS on the MASTER PACK since the amount of cards in it makes it impossible to get anything you actually want (you are better sticking to secret packs) and also ALWAYS BUY THE DUEL PASS since this battle pass not only returns your gem investment if completed but also rewards you with limited-time accessories and tons of CP from all the rarities.

- If you really want to add a meta element to your deck you can also go to the shop special section and under bundle deals you will see bundles with 10 Master Packs and also a meta staple card. 

- With all of this said if you dismantle any and every card you dont need and if you claim your rewards and open more packs you will end up with a good deck to enter ranked as any cards you dont get can probably be crafted with the CP earned from the dismantle of cards. 

When it comes to dueling the game helps you flagging posible actions that can be taken or cards that can be played in case you are not fully experienced with your deck. As you climb through ranked you will earn more gems that can be used to make your deck stronger and such. 

Again, as this is a competitive TCG it does take time to settle in but the more time you put and as long as you are playing cards that are fun to you I really think this game has a lot to offer for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. Ranked might be a tough pill to swallow at first but by making mistakes and losing duels is how you will learn.

While naturally it shares every issue with normal gameplay of the real card game, it also goes much deeper then that. First point: The gatcha system (while theres certainly FAR worse ones out there) is terrible. Grinding gems takes forever and once you've cleared solo mode, say goodbye to ever getting anything new ever again, because the game will VERY slowly drip feed you a paultry sum of gems IF YOU WIN a ranked match and thats about it (GOOD LUCK winning without a tier 0 deck)

Second point: Cheaters. The game is FULL of them. Everything you can imagine. FTK bots, AFK bots, players who can see your hand at all times, people who manipulate the cards drawn on both sides, deck stacking, its awful and nearly unplayable.

Third point: The TERRIBLE and WILDLY inconsistent banlist. So...you're telling me that the current tier 0 (which has been tier 0 for nearly 3 months now) doesn't have a single card even so much as semi-limited, but secret village, card of demise, POT OF PROSPERITY are banned? Maxx C is at 2. Pot of duality is at 1. What.

Fourth point: It is VERY begginer hostile. The game just expects you to casually pay over 100 REAL LIFE dollars to MAYBE get a CHANCE at getting specific cards that are essential and you litterally CAN NOT win even in rookie without. 

Fifth point: Bugs. And lots of them. I get this is the most complex card game of all time so naturally, when in digital form, its not gurenteed to work properly every time, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Were getting nonsense like a card that does NOT have to be face-up to resolve somehow fizzeling after being MST'd, cards whos activation requirement is something like ""Target 1 card you control"" and somehow not being allowed to activate it despite the fact there is NOTHING preventing targeting anywhere, special summoning from the grave with necrovalley on the field, ect ect. FIX YOUR GAME KONAMI

sixth point: The horrible meta: I get this is an issue in the TCG and OCG as well, but due to the wonky and weird banlist, i think its at its worst here. You better REALLY enjoy seeing the same 3 decks, because once you get past bronze its ALLLLL youre ever going to see for the rest of your life.

Seventh point: While this is not 100% proven yet, there is evidence to suggest the game is bias for asian players. Letting asian players start every duel with 3 different handtraps plus 2 different 1 card starters every single game whilst giving the english players 3 same named HOPT cards and 2 extenders that can't play through 3 hand traps. Or for the first time in 20 duels you open maxx c but AWWW DIDNT MATTER because the asian player opened ash, 2 starters, and extender, TTT, and maxx c themselves. It happens SO often and is almost always exlusively from asian players, that I am convinced the game plays favorites.

eighth point: The community is ULTRA toxic. No one is helpful, everyone is hostile, and everyone thinks theyre king of games while everyone else is worthless peasents. Any time you complain about ANYTHING its always ""skill issue"" (despite 50% of the game being luck) No, its not ""skill issue"" that konami themselves wanted the opponent to win and gave them 4 hand traps and a starter whilst not giving me and handtraps or breakers, thats RNG, not skill.


Overall, I simply can NOT recommend this horrible game to anyone who values their life or sanity. If you enjoy being screwed over by RNG while everyone who you simply ask for help or tips from mock you, go ahead, but no thanks. Im good.",False,1,0,1764173621

From the start of the game to the credit roll, Nier is a pleasant and melancholic game that pours a lot of attention into its side quests to paint a picture of life in a dying world.  It's a game as much about loving the NPCs struggling day after day as it is about its character-driven main story.

However, you may be aware that Nier is a game with multiple endings.  Rather than a choice of parallel endings that you see in many RPGs, this game follows from Drakengard and VNs in having sequential endings that build upon each other.  Or at least, they try to.

The positive part of my review ends at the credit roll for Ending A.  (Or a little after—the backstory you get for Kainé just after is also easily worthwhile.)  To reach the other endings, you have to repeat sections of the game again and again and again.  The actual new content is minimal—just a few extra cutscenes stretched thin across old bones.  What new content there is is rarely interesting, instead repeating or expanding emotional points that were already present in the original playthrough and could've been included the first time around.  The personality flaws of the main cast go unexplored, and the extra characterisation for your enemies changes the story from a tragedy into a tone-deaf farce.  Meanwhile, what emotional impact the story originally had is scrubbed off as you sit through the same scenes again and again, waiting for it to be over.

It should also be noted that combat itself is very shallow, and really doesn't stand up to replay.  By my final run of the ending boss gauntlet, I had figured out several points [i]during combat[/i] where I was free to scroll on my phone while button mashing or evading one-handed, barely glancing at the game screen.

Graphics that haven't been updated or even made for pc YEP.  Awful ""power up"" (word edit) system yep. Things that are left unexplained and just don't make sense YEP.

Another Awful thing about this game is there are things that take up a ridiculous amount of time and that are very unnecessary and annoying. There are parts where it MAKES YOU WALK and not just lil parts, When you're searching for EMIL you have to walk the entire time through the mansion at a snails pace and it really really makes it agonizing.. same with the light house, same with the boat, its weird and very very aggravating. One other horrible thing is basically there is NO FAST TRAVEL you spend hours running back and fourth between the same 4 places eventually they give you a guy on a boat that can take you places but hes always so far outta the way and not easy to get to that you might as well just run because you're gonna get there in the same amount a time give or take a few seconds.

This game was so lazy that instead of making a village they made a small room with trees in it with 4 npcs that were ""townspeople"".. Instead of it being a new area with a new boss.. its a ""dream forest"" where the mayor talks to you in text as if you were part of their dream and you fall victim to a ""death dream""
disease. The game then reads you PAGES of text and if you don't answer the changing text correct;y you have to start over and that my friends is one of the bosses/stages. Its most def one of the laziest things ive ever seen.

The games story isn't so bad it really isn't but if you're looking for a game like NeiR:Automata you're going to be extremely disappointed. I played through every single ending hoping something fun was gonna happen... instead i played the same exact thing 4 times out of 5 with the 5th being the weakest ending... ever.

But its 2021 remaster assumes it still fits the modern gaming landscape and has something fresh to offer. Unfortunately, it falls short.
The world feels empty and generic, the visuals are mediocre, and the gameplay mechanics are dated—reduced to following dots on a map and completing trivial fetch quests. Combat is shallow, with limited abilities and builds, repetitive enemies, problematic camera angles, and virtually no environmental sound design. Long, tiring walks and constant backtracking through the same locations make the experience feel like a chore. Worst of all, the game forces players to replay the same content up to five times to see the full story.
Had I played it back in 2010, I might have felt differently. I'm not sure because some thing would still bother me. But releasing it at full AAA price in 2021 invites comparison to modern titles—and by today’s standards, it simply doesn’t deserve your time or money.


Manometer: 4/10[/b]  


The good
- Interesting concept: The lore is rich and later became the backbone of ""Nier Automata"". The writing explores philosophical themes and occasionally becomes poetic. The text-adventure-style segments are especially beautiful.
- Well-crafted characters: Though a bit stereotypical, the main cast has vivid personalities that are easy to love.
- Despite the empty world and average visuals, the game creates a haunting, fairy-tale-like ambiance.
- The soundtrack is stunning and enhances the mood—though it plays constantly and can become overwhelming.
- Voice acting performances lean toward the epic rather than realistic, but they effectively convey each character’s personality and intent
- Nice, fluid animations with smooth transitions between moves. The feeling on the controller is great. It's nice that most weapons have different move sets.
- Well designed boss battles. Uniquely designed encounters that blend platforming mechanics with reflex-based challenges
- Battles are mediocre yet mixing melee attacks with projectile magic is a nice idea that adds a layer of depth.
- A subtle, clever sense of humor lightens the tone without becoming silly.

The bad
- I know it's a 2010 game, yet I was expecting more in this remaster especially after the ""Nier Automata"" success. Most models are low-poly, textures are poor (sometimes tiled), and the world feels repetitive and generic. Invisible walls and frequent loading screens break immersion.
- Again, this is a remaster of an older game but in 2021 a lot of things look obsolete. It's open world logic is completely worn forcing you to blindly follow markers on the map. A lot of the main objectives look like fetch quest as you have to go to various characters to see what they need. Its world is too small with only a few regions that the game forces you to visit again and again to face different enemies that weren't there before. In addition to that each region is usually filled with copy-paste corridors. All this repetition makes it boring.
- Shallow RPG mechanics. Few abilities and weapon combinations mean limited build diversity. New gear is usually just a straight upgrade, removing strategic choices.
- You have to walk into unbelievable long distances. Quests often send you back and forth to the same locations with minimal shortcuts. A lot of times after beating all the enemies in a region and fulfilling the objective, you have to backtrack though empty rooms. The fast travel mechanics that it offers are silly and don't alleviate the grind.
- Battle is mediocre. Despite teaching various tactics, most fights devolve into button-mashing chaos. A lot of battles become an indistinct blend of enemies and balls. It usually feels like they're undesigned. In addition to that healing or using items via menu pauses breaks the flow and feels outdated
- Except from the bosses, regular enemies are completely generic. Aside from bosses, most foes are indistinct black shapes with no unique traits. They just filled every region with the same enemies. Easily some of the most boring encounters I've ever met in a video game.
- Pointless side quests: Tasks like “bring an egg” or “fetch a watermelon” lack narrative depth and disrupt the main story’s vibes and continuity. Overall pacing is problematic Repeated visits to the library to speak with Popola feel unimaginative.
- It has multiple endings, yet after the first playthrough it becomes a chore. While multiple playthroughs reveal new story elements, they require replaying large portions of the game with no changes at all. Unlike ""Nier Automata"" which offered fresh perspectives and gameplay shifts it forces you even to go through repeated dialogues smashing the skip button just to unlock a few new cutscenes. It's an unbelievable choice that they punish you with this boring repetitiveness if you want to learn the whole story. Even more unbelievable is that you have to find all weapons in order to go through ending C.
- Cameras are weird and problematic. The camera often fails to follow the protagonist properly, and manual rotation is sluggish. Sudden shifts to top-down or side-view angles are too often feel arbitrary and disorienting—unlike ""Automata, where such changes were purposeful and enhanced gameplay. Here all these side scrolling platforming sessions and scenes that look like old arcades seem to be rushed and not so successful.
- Boss battles are well designed with some interesting mechanics, yet this thing with their health bars is a joke. These are inconsistent and confusing. Bars refill or change without clear logic, making it hard to gauge progress and turning them into a gimmick.
- Despite the deep lore and the good writing the the core narrative is basic and often relies on melodramatic clichés like self-sacrifice or excessive epic moments. 
- There is no environmental sound design at all. Here music dominates every scene, leaving no room for ambient sounds that could enhance immersion. Even moments of silence would have added depth.
- Ok it's not a puzzle game but if you decide to put some of them in there better make them interesting. The few puzzle rooms are overly simplistic and feel like filler content for children.
- Unbalanced difficulty. The game is generally too easy.. You will die only one or two time during a few boss battles. There is no challenge at all. Also, In subsequent playthroughs enemies remain mid-game strong while you’re at new game++ level. They cannot even touch you and you almost one hit kill them. Really boring.",False,3,1,1759763348

Spiritfarer,1113560,23.99,17,solo,"Action, Adventure, RPG",76561198117360203,"I played Automata back in 2017. Being much younger, tolerating stuff like ""you have to beat the game 3 times to reach the ending"" wasn't really an issue. Now in 2025, I sadly do not have the same free time to spend it on games like Replicant.

First things first. This game should have been a complete remake. This game actually feels like a very good remaster, in the sense that you feel like you are playing a PS3 game. The problem is, this remaster was released in 2021. So many other very good games came out that year so we dont really have much when it comes to technology not being enough. Toylogic simply didn't take any risks. The gameplay is incredibly stale, upgrades are mostly unnecessary and boring, spells are pretty fun for the first couple of hours but then get forgotten. The game nearly always felt like a chore to play. And I had to finish the game twice (Well actually 3 times if you want to see the real ending but i couldnt be arsed and watched it on youtube.) They really should have mishmashed Automata's different weapon styles with Reincarnation's spells to make it unique.

Enemies. Boring. Small dude. Big dude. Big dude with shield. Even bigger dude. Even bigger dude with shield. The bosses were pretty cool but there sadly are 5 of them and you are constantly put against them because of the repetition which kills their uniqueness. Again, extremely boring due to repetitiveness. Which is a very common issue with the game overall.

Scenery. It is pretty decent looking. For a PS3 game. For a remaster that was released in 2021, it looks bleak, the colors are dead and the settings are just bland. Some scenes were pretty but I never got the same feeling I got from Automata's introductions to new areas. 

Characters. Now this is a strange topic because Nier games are all about mystery and being attached to these characters who are put through hell for us to enjoy. I don't like the brother sister troupe so it was a miss for me (which is a personal thing and not an objective critisism) but the tones the characters give off is very weird. Nier, the main dude, is basically a slave. First to his sister, then to the villagers, then to his comrades, and finally to the village leaders. He is one of those main characters who never asks anything and just helps people around for the sake of helping. Then does a complete 180 and becomes something completely else. With no buildup, it just doesn't work. Side characters are pretty unique but without spoilers, I don't really like how they evolve as well. They lose their uniqueness while becoming generic with each minute you spend together.

And yes. The story. Yes, Yoko Taro fashion, it tells a very unique story with intense twists and turns. But I highly doubt it's worth the 35+ hour slogfest of mashing 2 buttons while going from marker to a marker. My recommendation is just read / watch an explanation about the story and skip to NieR: Automata.

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561199025497003,"Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a tactical role-playing game that revitalizes the classic CRPG formula with depth, freedom, and smart writing. It combines strategic turn-based combat, meaningful player choice, and cooperative gameplay to create one of the most complete role-playing experiences of its generation.

The story follows two Source Hunters investigating a mysterious murder in the city of Cyseal, gradually uncovering a plot that threatens the fabric of reality. The narrative is layered with humor, moral ambiguity, and philosophical undertones. Dialogue choices matter, influencing character relationships, quests, and even combat outcomes.

Gameplay is defined by its interactivity. Almost every object, surface, and environmental element can be manipulated. Fire spreads, water conducts electricity, and poison ignites. Combat becomes a puzzle where creative thinking often wins over brute force. This system rewards experimentation, not repetition.

Character creation and progression are flexible. Players can customize skills, attributes, and abilities without being locked into rigid classes. Cooperative play enhances this freedom—two players can explore, argue over choices, or separate to pursue different objectives simultaneously. The resulting dynamics make co-op feel organic rather than forced.

Visually, the Enhanced Edition improves textures, lighting, and interface clarity while keeping the game’s distinct hand-painted fantasy style. The redesigned UI and full voice acting make exploration and dialogue more immersive. Every conversation and environment feels alive and reactive.

The writing maintains a balance between wit and seriousness. Quests often carry multiple solutions, and morality is never simple. Whether you’re solving a murder, arguing with a talking shell, or deciding the fate of an entire village, the game constantly invites critical thinking and reflection.

In essence, Divinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition is a masterclass in player agency and tactical depth. It’s challenging, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Every decision feels personal, every victory earned through intellect and creativity. It stands as one of the finest examples of modern role-playing design rooted in classic principles.",True,1,0,1762683612

Divinity Original Sin,230230,0.0,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",76561198160031418,"This game to me is one that deserves a mixed rating. While I liked the game and had fun playing it, there were plenty of times  when it felt more of a slog to get through. The world is semi open-world that is both good and bad. Constant Saving felt like a must

Starting off, making my characters was fun, there were a good amount of classes to choose from. Playing around with some starting skill options, personal customization was ok nothing too crazy for the Two Player Characters you create as my heroes.
A few voices to choose from, personalities etc. Not everything in the game is voiced, most MC dialogue gets voiced with their little side quips, side characters here and there, most dialogue will be read. A few companions to choose from, I choose two and rocked with them, since I believe if you swap them in later their level's won't match yours, needs more testing?

Combat was fun and not fun, while it worked and gave me chances to be creative with combining the environment, items I have, spells and such to fight, it meant the enemy could do the same. With the world being open-ish often I'd find myself in fights I wasn't going to win, the battles can drag on since the AI sometime is fast, othertimes It's like Internet Explorer making a turn. Getting wiped just to fight the same long tedious fight drags on, trying multiple strats just to get perma stunned by 5+ enemies. The wide variety of spells and weapon types means you have to adjust based on the enemy, with some damage types healing them, (my best weapons healed the final boss, that was fun).

Locales/Vibes- locations looked great, it felt like an adventure, from simple beaches (how original lol) to ancient caves and tombs to spirit realms & even to the ends of time. In the same vein some locations were terrible, like the Luculla Sandstorm,  nothing was fun about making a conga line with my party to pull the enemy, spending 20 minutes to beat a enemy then running away to escape combat and teleport away just to rinse and repeat. 
There are traps and secrets hidden in the world, things like hidden grave to lava traps.

Puzzles, some felt fun and rewarding, while the majority were just annoying and killed the pace and fun of the game, You'll need to be used to separating your party and multi-tasking with them, along with reading everything ever. Or needing very ""specific"" weights needed on weight plates. Many of them feel like they're trying to be overly clever and are doing too much imo. 

This is the kind of game where you need to interact and talk with everyone and everything, which takes forever. Even then you'll still miss things and interactions. If only I realized my choices in events that gave my character points in their personality things like ""vindictive, pragmatic, romantic"" etc actually affected my character stats and potential dialogue options that could lock you out of things. Along with knowing what items can actually be dragged onto others to work.

To me, this game would make one do new runs over and over to fix their mistakes if they get softlocked. So yeah you could respec everything except personality points from dialog and benefits/detriments, but what if you lose your skills? So what if i can buy them again or craft them again except the skills for my Knight and ranger? Ones that can't be gotten again? I committed to my build and mistake and suffered for it. Some skills felt useless and were a waste of precious talent points. My rogue had near max stealth skill, and I was still getting discovered, so I just used his ""Make Invisible"" skill which actually worked and was 1000x better.

Quick Side note, Don't sell Tenebrium items to merchants, I then had to deal with dying merchants for the rest of the game, I kept alive with my mage spamming Rejuvenates.

An annoyance to me was near the end game, I couldn't progress past a door needing me to have Blood stone/Star Stones, story/lore items that also double as ""full party heals"" basically omega tier heals. It said I didn't have enough but I already went everywhere I could ingame. So there I was backtracking the whole game searching high and low for these supposed stones. I found one, the only last one, but he still wouldn't open. How was I supposed to know I needed to use my rare healing stones? Then after that go to my homebase to talk to some merchants for the door to then open saying I was then worthy.

While I did enjoy my time with this game, those moments were here and there bogged down by slow moments, overtuned encounters, overly annoying puzzles, slow combat and general shenanigans one would expect from this style of game. Again I say to better enjoy the game, it'd take multiple runs/attempts. It'd be more fun for me now that I know how it plays out and how to spec better. I'd recommend it to people who like this type of game and difficulty, however to the casual RPG gamer who just wants to have easy fun without thinking, no stress kind of thing, this isn't for you.",False,0,1,1760780429

The humor? Chef's kiss.
The characters? Absolute chaos goblins with personality.
The graphics? Weirdly gorgeous for a game that’s not exactly new anymore. Honestly, half the time I forgot this thing came out years ago, because everything looks like it has been polished by a team of very dedicated fantasy elves.

And the classes? Amazing. You can basically create anything from a teleporting rogue assassin who politely stabs people in the face… to a necromantic violinist who heals by bleeding on things. Truly art.

But then… Source Points happen.

Ah, yes. Source Points. The magical energy that fuels your strongest abilities, your coolest spells, is needed to acomplish dungeons/quests, and—apparently—your greatest frustration in life.

It’s not that the game limits you on them. That would actually be interesting, right? Making tough choices, thinking strategically, feeling the weight of your decisions?

Nope.
Divinity says: “You can refill them endlessly, dear player!”
And then quietly adds:
“…Just run back and forth like a lost chicken to do it.”

Why?
Why give me infinite refills… but only if I prove my dedication by jogging across Rivellon like I’m training for a marathon?
Why ruin the pacing of such a brilliant game with a mechanic that feels like an unpaid internship?

Instead of epic adventure, I get Source Point Fetch Quest Simulator 2017.

And that’s when my enthusiasm died a dramatic, theatrical death. Not by combat. Not by a boss. But by pure, uncut inconvenience. It’s like the game whispered:
""You like fun? Too bad. Go touch another puddle of ghost juice, peasant.""

So, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is still an incredible game with unforgettable humor, beautiful visuals, and rich gameplay.
But Source Points?
Yeah, no. Hard pass. When a mechanic makes me feel like I’m clocking in for my shift, I put down the controller and walk away.

Final Verdict:
A masterpiece held hostage by a mechanic that thinks I have the free time of a bored god. If Larian ever patches Source Points into something less annoying, I’m back in. Until then… Rivellon, it’s not you. It’s your weird energy system.",False,1,1,1763244560

Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198133077347,"I really would love to like this game. It has engaging combat, a great multiplayer and interactivity that I have not seen before.
The start at Fort Joy is amazing to play. It's the best balanced and the most well-rounded. I always knew where to go, always found new things to explore and I never felt lost story wise.

All of this starts to turn around in the following acts and I feel like it gets worse or at least more glaring the further you progress. 
These glaring issues for me are:

[b] ""Open World"" [/b]
On Fort Joy the open world felt rewarding. The battles were challenging but beatable. So, I was delighted to see what may come after Fort Joy.

What I ended up finding were ""natural"" level barriers that forced my friend and I to follow a linear route to so that we could beat the battles (note that we played on normal).
Finding this linear route after the game told us to pick and choose where we wish to go next just felt confusing. In total it took us a month to progress (we played once every week). We desperately staked out which area might be appropriate for our level 12 characters. I still remember each area of the second act and which level is associated with. 
Perhaps we where unfortunate to not have chosen this path. Mayhaps, we simply overread an important dialog pointing us towards the right direction.
The only thing I know for sure is that the only for us beatable area was [spoiler]in the top left corner[/spoiler] of the map.

You have to pass multiple other areas with higher levels to get there.
Nevertheless, this area was still a mighty struggle. We fought with everything we had. We strategized about each battle. After every loss we took notes, regrouped and attacked again. Every potential ""exploit"" we could see, we utilized.

This level of tenacity does not feel appropriate for a normal difficulty playthrough at least not for me.

[u]Recommendation[/u]
The pre-set levels with the exponential leveling system to not work together with the ""open world"" aspect of the game.
I'll get more in-depth with the leveling in the next part, but giving the player the directive to ""reign freely"" while setting fixed levels to the enemies does not add up. 
Adjusting the enemies to the level the player is feels way more appropriate. Maybe, sprinkle in some fixed levels as a boss to really stop the player if the story demands it, but putting this everywhere is just misguided. 

Especially since it let to us loosing track of the story completely. We started each quests, but we could never finish them due to the battles. So after a week or two we came back to the quest without having a clue of what was going on. (The in-game journal is quite lack luster on this regard)

[b]Levelling[/b]
In total you can get up to level [spoiler]21[/spoiler], which feels a little low looking at other RPGs. The issue I have with this is that you are at level [spoiler]12 when leaving Fort Joy[/spoiler]. This leads to the weird situation that levels are exponentially more important the closer you get to the max level.

At first you may be able to win a battle against a two levels higher foe, but towards the end if you are not on the same level as your enemy, you get demolished.
We literally couldn't defeat the final boss since we were one level below it. Coincidentally, we also were at a point were we felt like we completed every quest available to us. After trying for another fruitless three weeks, we loaded a previous save and tried to squeeze out another level so we have even an inkling of a chance.

As a [u]recommendation[/u] I can just offer a proper re-balancing of the later areas and a plead for general level cap increase. In the last stages of the game seeing the next level XP requirement to be in the millions is disheartening.

[b]Quest Management[/b]
A more minute point but it feels like the bad cherry on top of the issue cake. 
The in-game journal feels in-adequate to help the player remember story points and even gist's of quests. The best you can hope for is a red marker on your map, and a small to-do entry. The point of the quest, the afflicted affiliations and the severity are often not included. 

Especially after our 3-week excursion through level barrier hell, we essentially reached a point of mindless ""red flag grinding"". I at least felt like a zombie trying to stave my XP-hunger by any means possible. So, every found quest was like a 3-star prepared meal and I devoured it as far as I could, but the chef seemed to hate me and always put glass shards in the food so that I had to come back to it later after my gums were accustomed to the ""difficulty"" (Essentially I needed to level to beat a foe)

Everything combined together let to me loosing completely any inkling of the story.

A small anecdote concerning story. My friend and I felt like we managed to skip great chunks of it unwillingly. One example for this is the story around Gareth.

For me it felt as follows: [spoiler]The great leader Gareth managed to escape the prison island Fort Joy with the help of his divine acquaintances (us). Together they set sail to Reaper's Coast where Gareth's parents resided. He immediately went to his parents but Magisters seemed to have been a step ahead of him. The battle did not take long, but neither did the triumph. Beneath rubble lay two corpses ... his parents. Silently he buried them. A deep anger begins taking hold of Gareth. Before he could do anything reckless his two divine acquaintances appear. He told them what happened. The trio stood there silently. Until one divine spoke up: ""It is what it is, bro"".

These words quiet the anger immediately and Gareth went back to the ship never do to anything of note again.
[/spoiler] 

I do not know how one should experience his tale but this is beyond ridiculous.

This was roughly the experience I had with almost all of the story points which is why during the end credits I felt like I was being introduced to new characters since I could not for the life of me remember who any of the characters even where.

My [u]recommendation[/u] for this one would be to add more information to the journal, and to add a glossary to keep track of the different parties, their goals and what the situation currently is. The chapters setup did not help at all. It rather added to the confusion because some quests where chapter-overlapping, so they never disappeared.

[b]Gear[/b]
I had a very unique problem with gear throughout the whole game. Namely, I was often stuck with too low leveled gear because of set combos. These set combos gave me unique traits which I liked, but I could never transition smoothly to a new set due to bonuses of the set combo.

So my solution would be to upgrade my gear, but there is no way to level up gear. There is a DLC-esque bundle modifications containing the gear sisters. Which adds four sister merchants in the game which sell you (limited) quantities of gear upgrade ingredients. Even if you managed to pay their insanely steep prices (easily 10k per PIECE). Their limited quantity would not even allow you to upgrade a full set of unique gear ONCE.

I re-iterate my final gear that was a 5 piece armor set, was physically not possible to be upgraded fully ONCE even if I collected ALL the armor upgrade ingredients.

[u]Recommendation[/u]: Please let me upgrade my gear, I'm begging you.

[b]Overall[/b], I think the game has a fantastic premise, but these points just gave me such frustration while playing that I simply felt saddened by the thought of what could be. If I'm just unlucky with how my playthrough went please tell me what I could have done. I'd really love to find my appreciation again for this game.",False,2,0,1762818932
Divinity Original Sin 2,435150,44.99,0,solo/multiplayer/co-op,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",76561198051875226,"Crashes frequently. Different places, different times, whether playing a few minutes or for longer periods of time. Crashes in Fort Joy walking into arena. Crashes in Reaper's Coast. Game simply exits. No error message, warning, or indication about to exit. Just back to desktop.

Windows recommended compatibility settings for Windows 8. Larian support page recommended running game directly without Steam. Still crashes on windows 10. Played fine for a while. Then doesn't play fine. 

Camera is visually disorienting when edge panning due to elevation changes (trees, cliffs, anything similar). Camera jumps high, jumps low. When scrolling around to see where to go, find a chest, road, or something, this is just plain awful.

Find a place you want to go on the big map? No way to click a point and instruct party to go there. Exit map and walk there bit by bit or scroll the area (with that disorienting up / down camera going across terrain), find your spot, click and hope your party doesn't stop for ground obstructions or obstacles.

Mario 64 has better camera free look than Divinity OS 1 or 2.  That's on Nintendo 64! 
I don't know how beta testers didn't get headaches from this camera in Divinity 2.

General rule of thumb appears to be destroy opponents before they get turns. Enemy turns take a long time. Sometimes, game decides to think about what to do (I guess?) so a minute or so later, finally completes that opponent's turn. Now do it again for the other 5+ in the fight. No way to skip this waiting.

Battles are so monotonous on enemy turns, I do something in another monitor. Maybe that's why I get crashes ... trying to play windowed. I don't know. Battles are time consuming and boring. Wait, wait, and wait some more. Oh, you're incapacitated? No turn for you. Now wait again. Oh, look, still incapacitated. Just reload game, try to knock them into incapacitated statuses first. Or just explore elsewhere, come back with another level or two, and wonder why they were difficult at all.

Some waypoints should be closer, especially when a story quest sends you somewhere repeatedly. 

The quest log ... is unusable the more quests appear on the list. No search option. So you play along, get a message such and such quest updated, go to look. Spend 20 minute reading them line by line looking for this quest that IS NOT THERE!! Where is it? I don't know. I saw the message, I know the name. I can google it. I cannot find it in the log. The log is USELESS clutter. The internet is easier if you're looking for a particular quest, details, story, or what to do. The built in quest log in this game is unusable as it enlarges with various quest tidbits. A search feature would help immensely here. Same for inventory for finding something. Some prankster designed a chest that you must be in precisely the right camera position to actually reach. Thankfully, there's a skill to just put stuff like that into your inventory without that level of work. After 5 minutes of trying to copy from a youtube video, I gave up and used the spell. That's just bad design.

Game's a time suck. Get used to it eventually. Pace of combat is slow. You can click faster than the game is ready, ending up walking somewhere instead of actually using a skill from your hotbar. Camera is horrible for elevation up / downs. Other games have similar jerkiness in their camera movements as well. This game, you have to look around and that's difficult to have occur so much, even just rotating around to see the terrain for a battle.

Oh, and my favorite is staring at the game waiting for combat to advance only to see the message: Not your character's turn. Have to go click on your portrait to do your turn. The game didn't put it there automatically. Seems random when it occurs.

 I must've put in 30+ hours without a crash. Then, one day, crash after crash. Install new software? No. Change drivers? No. Skip playing a week or so, then put in a long time - all the way to Arx with maybe two crashes. Fire up next day, try a new game for kicks to experiment, four crashes before even escape Fort Joy. That's not fun.

Divinity OS 2 has easier inventory management (still a pain with a lot of stuff) and equipping gear, spells, etc. than Divinity 1. Game 1 is more stable on my windows 10. Game 2 crashes - a lot. That's what sucks the fun right out of number 2.

Also, divinity 2 has less of all that creepy blood emphasis of game 1.
It just crashes repeatedly :(

The graphics are pretty good for everything other than the people, and if that's a sticking point for you then I would still recommend going with the remaster either via upgrade or buying it outright.
There is a good range on difficulty from Very Easy, to Ultra Hard. I personally found it to be best on Hard/Very Hard as it makes you use more of your tools, but I also find the jump from Very Hard to Ultra Hard to be a bit much compared to the others.

The writing is... mediocre. Many points are rehashed several times on several different occasions and the dialogue swings wildly between stock NPC templates and amusing if not interesting characters, most of which I find to be located in the DLC. To its credit the few times the game gives you a choice in how to respond it feels like the choice is actually different from the others, but they do all lead to the same point in the end.

The combat has unique systems, and a good number of monsters to fight, even with a fifth of them being some flavor of ""large cat with a gun strapped to it back"". There probably could have been a bit more variety in monster types, but the ones that do exist each have their own strengths and weakness to exploit, so combat feels more engaging than just ""hit the thing till it dies"".

First and foremost, there are a lot of things that were improved on:
- more and varying enemies
- improved area details
- more content
- improved graphics
- incredibly beautiful music
- world feels much more alive 

HOWEVER, here are my nitpicks:
- WAY too many abilities (my controller buddies will understand that one)
- parasitic game design with the abilities 
- puzzles are less creative than from the predecessor
- story is alright, however it feels like a downgrade from the story of the predecessor and doesn't make a whole lot of sense at certain points

At times it feels like the game is an Ori game in name alone. I REALLY liked the first game for what it made different from most games. I don't really understand why Ori needed weapons in this game? Especially since they feel a bit off for a character like Ori. 
Sure, Sein existed in the predecessor. Which you could technically count as a weapon. And certainly the first game had a lot of different ways to engage with enemies (stomp, throwing them into thorns, throwing glowing balls at them, throwing their own projectiles back, etc.). Perhaps I'm just thrown off that Ori was given swords, a giant frying pan, bows, spears, etc. in this game. Might just be me tho.
The sheer amount of different trees that can be found throughout the game make the trees much less special to find over time.
I remember playing blind forest for the first time and getting very excited for every tree I found. In ""Will of the Wisps"" finding trees does get tiring after a while due to the sheer oversaturation of them (not to mention all the other stuff you can find, like shards). 

I kind of wish that Ku would've played a bigger role/would've been playable for longer. 

At times it feels like the devs tried making a different game, but had to use the Ori IP for it (That's just my tinfoil hat theory tho, lmao)

If you expect puzzles like in ""blind forest"", this is not really the game for you. Stick with the first game.
This game focusses much more on combat and for that it's well done. The bosses are challenging and enjoyable (My favorite is Mora). Less abilities or a different way to implement them all would've been preferred from my point of view.
If you want a lot of bosses, play the Hollow Knight series instead.",True,0,0,1764182551

The early parts are simple, mainly teaching basic actions. As the game goes on, the paths get more complex and the obstacles become trickier.

The devs really nailed the visual polish—every scene element has smooth, detailed animations that make the world feel lively, and the extra layering gives the whole game a stronger sense of depth. There are also a lot of smart quality-of-life touches that other Metroidvania-style games should definitely learn from: the death penalty isn’t excessive, there’s no pointless grind or “trash time” and the speedrun challenges are super efficient to retry. Mess up? Boom—instant restart. And when you finish a run, it sends u right back to the starting point eliminating unnecessary waiting or backtracking. Plus, all hidden items can be collected before finishing the game, so you never get permanently locked out just becuz the story moved forward.
[b]Downsides:[/b] Map opens with an awkward lag and doesn’t remember ur zoom level. The pacing falls off right before the end—there’s one brutally hard area that completely breaks the flow. New soundtrack doesn’t have any standout tracks, mainstory is pretty forgettable, and the guidance toward new areas is really unclear.

Why am I here? 

Devs...when *I* play a game and spend hours unlocking abilities. I want to use those abilities. Seems pretty straight forward?

I really enjoyed this game but there were a few pain points which makes me hesitate to recommend it to my friends. The over-arching theme of my issues with the game can be summarized with 'I don't know what to do / where to go' - I should note I went into the game completely blind having only played ori 1 so I had no pre-info about the game.

1: some mechanical kbm skill is required to play(/enjoy?) the game, but people who have the needed kbm skills will probably figure out pretty early on that some melee attacks can give you some extra air time, allowing you to bypass obstacles and reach areas you shouldn't reach. I thought I was being clever by juggling my way up ridges and plateaus or by being able to get the relatively expensive triple jump as soon as I saw the merchant, but in reality I was progressing more than I actually should have been leading me to get stuck multiple times and sometimes even having to use back-up saves.


2: fake solutions (things that seem plausible but are not the solution). Example: I used the bash ability to juggle an enemy along in mouldwood depths (they provide light) to reach a location which I thought held a secret, but it was actually part of the natural progression of the game I had to go to later. It wasn't always clear to me what was a secret and what was natural progression of the game where I really shouldn't have had access to, and boy did this happen often.
One more example would be the soup kettle in the glades, I had not been introduced to the mechanic of fanning (with the feather, like bellows) the fire of the cooking pot to get it to erupt something and I think I didn't even have the flap ability at this point in the game, as I reached this area through 'clever use of game mechanics'. So here I am spending 15 minutes seeing whether the monster has to use his axe on the floor to break the ice (plausible solution), or whether maybe I had to buy the blaze ability to melt stuff (plausible solution) and so forth. When I finally did get the instruction of having to use the fanning to get it to erupt I thought I had to redirect the fireball to the ice via bashing to break it (plausible solution) and was very disappointed when it didn't.

The most egregious one was in the ice zone and I actually had to google how to pass this, but it's where a wall of ice is blocking the final door keystone and there's a kettle nearby. Above you is a monster that erupts when you get close and shoots a projectile at you, from what I could tell these monsters are used almost exclusively to provide you with a projectile to bash off of. Now right in front of the kettle is a wooden plank on which you can stand, but projectiles pass through, and this is demonstrated very clearly with the aforementioned monster. When you drop down into it the only point of interest is a shrine that needs to be lit up, so every fiber of my intuitive-game-logic is telling me that I need to fan the pot and redirect the fireball into this area, but it just isn't working and I can't figure it out. Turns out there's a shrine much further down which had to be hit by the projectile.

3: minimap. I am naturally a bit 'lost' when it comes to navigating, both in real life and in videogames, so this isn't really a stab at the world being hard to navigate but rather about how cumbersome it is to keep having to load up the map (which takes a while btw!) to check where exactly I am and have to go. I would much rather have a sort of 'overlay' map option that I can toggle freely without it having to load.
Perhaps some sort of arrow indicator would be nice too, to remind me where I'm going (before anyone says this breaks immersion: loading up the minimap every 10 seconds also breaks immersion). I'm thinking similar to what BioShock would use.

Finally, the minimap could highlight some things better, like points of interest. In Kwolok's cave (or whatever it was called) there's a door that's unlocked by pulling a lever after redirecting a bolt to destroy a purple wall, and for whatever reason I had done all of this except pull the lever and I couldn't figure out how to open the door, I had done pretty much everything else there was to do at this point in the game regarding the main storyline and was stuck. I had to google it (which made me go 'duh, how did I miss that'), it would be nice if it would just indicate on the minimap that there was a lever there. At the end of the game when you're killing creeper hearts it shows where the teleportation funnels lead to with dotted lines, can't we have something similar for levers and things? I'm just a bit of an idiot, I need the extra guidance (although I did immediately realize what the bell music puzzle was and how to solve it, but that's probably because I played the Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus games a million times).

4. speedruns are annoying to watch
Too much menu'ing, interestingly something that plagued the first game as well and it's even worse here. I enjoy looking at different types of speedruns after I've completed the game but the menu'ing is just so annoying, even in categories which restrict menu'ing. I would have hoped that the devs (who I KNOW some of to be speedrun enthusiasts) would have added a 'speedrun' mode of the game which unlocks after having finished the game, that automatically skips things like cutscenes and prevents saving/loading (aside from autosaves like when you die in game), perhaps even has an in-built tracker (which the normal game already kind of has).

Overall this was an enjoyable game that I do not regret buying but I did find myself more frustrated than I would ideally like to have been and also far more than I have been in other types of games, and unfortunately this frustration was not a good type of frustration. I didn't feel like I overcame a challenge when I got frustrated, but rather 'I wish this was made more obvious to me' or 'oh God do I really have to backtrack that much? there's no spirit well to warp to?'

FWIW: It took me just under 15 hrs to finish the game on a blind normal playthrough at around 65% completion if the in-game time is to be believed.

EDIT: one more thing I forgot, the limited (3) ability options at the same point in time. I knew from the moment I saw the wheel of abilities with the potential spots available that at some point in time I was going to have overlap between abilities (as in, for example: I always have a certain ability on X and swap it out for another ability when needed, but now there's an area where I need both of these abilities, which means I want to press X for both of them due to muscle memory). Did we really need to limit this to 3 slots?

It's a Metroidvania, so the map opens up as the player explores and unlocks new abilities. The problem is that, unlike Symphony of the Night or other classic titles in the genre, Ori and the Will of the Wisps lets you go incredibly far in the wrong direction before you discover you can't progress because you're missing a key ability. A better game would lock its paths behind the abilities you need for completing them. In other words, if you need the bash ability to reach the end of a hallway, a well-designed game would require you to use bash to even [i] access [/i] that hallway in the first place. It would not waste your time, allowing you to wander down the impassable hallway for several minutes, before discovering at the end of it all that you don't actually have the ability to proceed. At the very least, a better game would branch that hallway into other areas you [i] can [/i] access so you're not stuck backtracking for hours on end.

This isn't a tiny gripe. It's a key problem with the way the game progresses. Map design is absolutely crucial to a Metroidvania, and Ori has a poorly designed map. A good Metroidvania gently nudges the player in the right direction. If you discover you can't reach the path to the next boss, there's likely a route somewhere nearby that will unlock a crucial ability for defeating that boss. Since Ori never locks any of its routes, getting lost means getting [i] really [/i] lost. You start to wonder if you're going the wrong way or if you're just missing something hiding in plain sight.

A perfect example: I couldn't access an area of the game called the Wellspring. It turns out, I needed to use an ability to redirect enemy projectiles to open a door. The game never explained that I [i] could [/i] redirect enemy projectiles. It simply told me to use the redirection ability for movement, and that's all it required me to do with it for a very long time. So I was stuck for over an hour trying to get the enemy to shoot the door itself, trying to unlock a new path, and trying to find a new ability I [i] thought [/i] I was missing, all because the game failed to demonstrate the projectile-redirecting ability before it was crucial for progression. A good game teaches the player how to use a new ability in a low-stakes situation before progressing to a high-stakes one—essentially taking the training wheels off. A bad game expects the player to know the mechanics automatically, even when they aren't intuitive.

Ori just doesn't understand how game ""psychology"" works. A lot of negative reviews say the game is too hard. I disagree with that. The game is just badly designed, so it makes itself harder than it needs to be. Are you jumping incorrectly, or are you missing a power-up? Is the door ahead of you locked, or is there some secondary use for an ability you already have? Those are questions that lead to frustration. A Metroidvania should feel rewarding to play. It should be addictive to unlock new areas and create a stronger character. It should not grind to a halt every thirty seconds and leave you wondering if you're missing something.

Aside from that, while the graphics are beautiful, the main character is small, and the camera is pulled too far back. It's easy to lose sight of Ori on screen, especially when there's a light shining in the background behind him. The environments are lush to the point of sacrificing visual clarity. It's sometimes hard to tell what's an overhang and what's dangling moss, what's a thorny vine and what's set dressing. The music is fine. It's nothing special, but it fits the mood of the game and provides calming ambiance. The characters aren't the next Mario or Sonic, but they're designed reasonably well. Ori looks appropriately quick and nimble. The world looks like an illustration in a storybook, which matches the childlike nature of the plot. There are good production values here, but they're in service of an inherently flawed experience.

I knew, just by looking at it, that Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be the type of game players lose their minds over. It's pretty. It copies Hollow Knight. It tugs on the heartstrings in a Disney kind of way. But I think players are focusing on the flashy trimmings and ignoring the core game play. That core is rotten. There's too much wasted time, too many frustrating questions, and too many shortcuts taken by the developers who should have been crafting a thought-out, interconnected map. They prioritized the wrong elements and made something that is more ""vibes"" than substance.

The DEMO lagged on my MEDIUM END machine yet looked AMAZING.  So I MAY need a GPU upgrade :)

but, i am not my character. by virtue of this being a videogame and not an actual TTRPG scenario, i cannot pick any option in this game that would actually suit how anybody in my party would react to the situations presented in this game. nobody acts like sentient beings who have the possibility of having any internality. in fact, the game has so many ""quirky"" dialogue options that it just seems like all of the party actually hate each other and none of them want to be doing what they're doing, but the plot demands it, so they must.

the only thing i enjoyed in this mess of a game was the combat. but it is quite literally bog standard 5e combat, so it's very hard to truly fuck up.

Overall – Blasphemous is a haunting blend of tough combat, stunning pixel art, and deeply atmospheric world-building. Playing as the Penitent One, you explore the bleak land of Cvstodia, an environment overflowing with twisted religious imagery and beautifully crafted, unsettling detail. The gameplay leans into deliberate, Souls-like combat. Every swing feels weighty, every enemy demands attention, and bosses are memorable, punishing, and incredibly satisfying to overcome. You’ll die often, but each attempt teaches you something, making progress feel genuinely earned. The story is delivered through cryptic dialogue and environmental clues rather than straightforward exposition, giving the game a mysterious, poetic tone. It’s the kind of world that invites you to piece it together rather than giving you answers outright. If you enjoy challenging Metroidvanias with rich atmosphere and art that sticks with you, Blasphemous is absolutely worth playing. Highly Recommended.

Here's the most frustrating characteristic of each point:
- platform usually requires high precision, i.e. if you don't jump exactly at the border of a platform, you won't grab it but instead will fall through it;
- exploration doesn't give you clues about where to go next so, every time you beat a boss and complete an area, you either look on the Internet or have to go forth and back in every single part of the map, until you find a new area you can access (and, of course, being a souls-like, this not only takes time but it's also annoying because enemies keep re-spawning);
- all enemies deal damage just by contact, and with punishihng hit-boxes (like, being close to a still enemy is equivalent to getting smashed by a hammer).
  This is not only another source of frustration both while doing platform and exploration/navigation, but also results in added frustration while fighting, in having to calculate not to end up too close to an enemy after an attack, and sometimes in not having a single safe point in the screen, when it's full of enemies.

I hate those. They simply do not work properly.

I've played some horrible platforming sections in games prior, but this takes the cake, no the whole bakery.
Trying to grab unto ladders is 50/50 and trying to sword climb/hang is about 25/75.
It's just inconsistent and results in your death every time, which would be fine if it wasn't caused by poor mechanics.

I've played less than an hour and have already died to this about 20 times and not a single time to enemies

The arbitrary difficulty of this game just makes it plain not enjoyable. Most of the time it feels like you're dying because of the game design and the controls, rather than your own mistakes. 

I've also had a myriad of issues relating to controls with both controller and keyboard/mouse. Sometimes when you die playing with a controller, the game stops recognizing any buttons during the death screen, so you have to press a key on the keyboard and then all your inputs go back to KB/M. Even if you continue playing like that, since the game still recognizes the controller, it turns out the Dodge button doesn't work, which leads to yet another stupid death. You then decide to play with KB/M (spending some time in the control settings to remap things) and then think that you're good to go and enjoy the game when you pick up an item and realize you can't scroll the text in the item description, but you can with a controller.

* Attend culinary school
* Make life-changing choices
* And romantically pursue a bishonen anime version of Colonel Sanders, who has more abs than menu items.

Not a parody *of* KFC.
A parody dating sim **by** KFC.

---

### Pros

* 100% free, which is good, because you’ll need that money for actual chicken afterward.
* Genuinely gorgeous anime art. Everyone looks like they escaped from Ouran Host Club and fell into a deep fryer.
* You’re a culinary student at the “University of Cooking School: Academy for Learning,” which is the most legally safe fake school name ever written.
* Cast includes:

  * Hot Sanders
  * Your supportive bestie
  * Evil rivals Aeshleigh & Van Van the Man Man (yes that’s his name)
  * Professor Dog, who is an actual dog in a little chef’s hat
* There’s a secret ending, “secret recipes,” and dramatic “cooking battles” that feel like Iron Chef on a marketing budget.

---

### Cons

* Steam tags say things like “Souls-like,” “FPS,” and “World War I” because the community is unhinged. Please ignore them.
* Choices “have consequences,” but most of the time the real consequence is Colonel Sanders being slightly disappointed in you, which honestly hurts more than a game over.
* Actual dating content is pretty tame; it’s less “thirst sim” and more “branding exercise with sparkles.” Critics were… not impressed. Players, on the other hand, are just vibing.
* You *will* finish it and realize you just emotionally invested in a man whose primary character trait is “11 herbs and spices.”

---

### Peak Colonel Experience

* Trying to give a sincere answer in class and being out-performed by a literal cooking robot named Clank.
* Getting genuinely nervous about impressing Sanders with your mashed potatoes.
* Replaying scenes to optimize dialogue like: “If I pick the wrong line, will he *not* franchise with me?”
* Credits roll and you close the game… then immediately google if anyone has actually cosplayed this version of Sanders. (They have. Of course they have.)

When I first booted up I Love You, Colonel Sanders!, I expected something campy, absurd, maybe even weirdly charming. A branded dating sim starring a hot anime version of the KFC mascot? It’s a wild concept — and in theory, a great setup for a parody or tongue-in-cheek experience. Unfortunately, once the initial novelty wore off, I found myself stuck in a painfully shallow game that feels more like an extended advertisement than anything resembling meaningful entertainment.

Visually, the game does a decent job. The character art is polished, and the overall aesthetic embraces the overly dramatic tone of anime dating sims with enthusiasm. But once you get past the surface, there’s not much there. The writing leans heavily into absurdity, but rarely in a way that feels smart or subversive. Most of the jokes fall flat, relying on randomness or self-awareness without actually saying anything clever. It’s quirky for the sake of being quirky — and after ten minutes, the charm runs out.

Worse, the “dating sim” mechanics are practically nonexistent. There’s barely any player agency or branching narrative to speak of. Choices feel inconsequential, and the story rails you through a linear path with little room for exploration or interaction. You’re not really playing a game — you’re reading through a branded fever dream with a couple of flavorless choices tossed in to justify the format.

And let’s talk about tone. For a game so fixated on parody, it’s weirdly toothless. It doesn’t parody dating sims so much as copy their structure and coat it in fast-food references. There's no critique, no clever twist — just KFC product placement wrapped in anime tropes. The whole thing feels safe, corporate-approved, and strangely hollow, like someone tried to be ironic without really understanding the genre they’re riffing on.

I don’t mind games being silly or promotional, but they still need to respect the player’s time. I Love You, Colonel Sanders! is all concept and no follow-through. Once you get the joke — “Haha, it’s Colonel Sanders but hot!” — there’s nothing else to latch onto. No gameplay depth, no meaningful story, no emotional engagement. Just a long commercial disguised as a game.",False,3,0,1753755753

Someone praised the story but it was an incoherent pile of sentences. I sincerely can't remember anything about it, some androids fighting some robots and mandatory rebels wanted something too.

Fighting in general is fine but holy f boss fights are a hot mess.

About 7h played, just got to the village. I've taken my time to explore but I don't really have anything worthwile to show for it so there is no joy in that.
I don't like the fighting, it feels slow, awkward lock-on and camera movement and aiming with the pod is annoying.
The story seems very, very good based on the hints so far but you get so little of it and it's just so much running between places - like a FF game haha.

The hacking minigame seems broken? I could fire in the first one but after that I can't shoot (the pod shoots just fine outside of the hacking game so key-mappings are fine). Every time there is a hacking minigame I take damage instead and have to use a restore item. At least I assume you should shoot at that ball which shoots at you(?) because if I take 0 damage in that minigame I still take damage outside. Very confusing and annoying.

Don’t Starve surprised me with how well it blends whimsical art with grounded survival mechanics. The atmosphere is incredible, the survival loop is addictive, and the game still holds up after all these years. Combat is the weakest part, but everything else pulled me in. For the price, it’s absolutely worth it.

The Good:
• Amazing Tim Burton-style art and quirky tone
• Strong survival loop with great early-game pacing
• Realistic mechanics that actually matter (fire spreading, sanity, sleep)
• Weather, darkness, and nightfall create genuine tension
• Lots to discover and experiment with
• Time flies, easy to get absorbed

The Not-So-Good:
• Combat feels basic and predictable
• Early sanity confusion until you understand the system
• Building in a 2.5D space can feel a little awkward
• Requires trial-and-error before things start to really click

Final Verdict: 7.5/10

One of the better survival games out there if you like creepy whimsy and grounded mechanics. Combat needs work, but the atmosphere and loop are excellent.

Combat always feels like an uphill battle because it feels like no matter what strategy I try using, I'm doing something wrong and getting hit HARD by the enemies. This became tedious and annoying when exploring and going back the screen I was just on like 5 seconds ago just to find out that the enemies reapawned, and they're a pain to avoid! I've played so many JRPG type games but the combat system just wasn't clicking for me. 

I also just couldn't get into the humor or be bothered to care about the side characters. I dunno, maybe it's because I played Deltarune so much only a couple of months before this game and I intentionally and unfairly compare the 2 of them - of course this would seem dull in comparison to that game for me. 

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. The combat in concept is a really fun idea and the story seems interesting. Overall it was just too meh for me to want to continue. 

I would probably still recommend this game, but there's one really annoying flaw that I experienced while playing it that I can't forgive. The issue is simple yet big enough to have a negative impact on gameplay for multiple sections of the game - THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SO DANG DARK. I encountered a section where you're alone in a dark house, and I almost thought my system was frozen because I could barely see anything. This resulted in me fumbling around in the dark and extending that section of the game by like another half hour longer than it was supposed to take because I just couldn't see where to go. I tried everything I could think of involving messing with brightness, contrast, gamma, docking it to my TV, etc. It seems this is not an issue unique to me, because I found a couple of forums concerning the issue and none of their propsosed solutions worked. I guess this was the case for a couple of other people on the forums because they quit the game too since there are multiple dark sections of the game they didn't want to deal with lol. I just don't see how the devs haven't fixed something so glaringly obvious and annoying after all this time that the game has been released. I would've considered returning this and purchasing it on the Nintendo Switch but I already went over the 2 hour play time and couldn't return it so I didn't want to waste my money again 🙃

That's not what the game actually calls them, but it's what I'll call them. Each world has ""sequences"" to them. You cannot explore the entirety of the dream world before the real world, and vice versa. The first sequence of the dream world seemed decently engaging enough, where the rules that the game establishes for itself not being set in stone, and each interaction and fight feeling new and fresh. This maintains itself in the first sequence in the real world, where I was able to explore it and find all the connections between it and the dream world. And then after that...the rules have already been established, and the game doesn't particularly deviate from it, if at all. And those interesting parallels aren't really drawn anymore. So it's just a long, repetitive...well, I wouldn't say slog. But it isn't particularly enjoyable.
 Story wise...there is a twist that completely sours the story. A part of me doesn't want to reveal the twist, but then again, if you don't want to play a game again simply because you know the twist to it, what's the point of the game, really? In short, I can't sympathize with manslaughter. You, the character, have committed a criminal act. If not involuntary manslaughter, then staging it to look like a suicide certain doesn't help things, either. And THEN the main character and the character who helped you stage the body feel bad about it? They feel bad about losing a friend? Would it have killed them to, I don't know, call for help? Instead of staging it to look like a suicide? That's what a friend would do! Get their friend help! Now, I haven't actually reached the end. I've just seen enough spoilers through the community of this game to have found that out. And that twist just completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. Getting so attached to some characters in a movie, show, or video game just for it to not resolve in a fulfilling way...you know, closure...that's one of the greatest sins a piece of media can commit.

-This may fall under me disliking RPGs, but I really wish there was no/a higher limit on the number of saves you can have at once.
-Interacting with stuff is weird. Sometimes you need to press and hold, and sometimes it wont let you close out after a single tap.

Honestly this game is dying and it's killing me to admit it :

- Queing/Matchmaking will play with your nerves because of dodging and server errors. Today again I queued for 15 minutes to get a RM. 
- Servers and Codebase are pure trash, and I'm not even exagerating. Constants drops, players crashing (and stop saying it's because of potatoes PC, High end Configs crashes too). 
- You can't get back in a game after a crash, so it's instant GG. 
- Players crash is happening all the time. Looking at my history on insights, there's about 1 on 2 games that last between 1 and 5 minutes because of players dropping out of the game.

NEVER play without sound. The indie soundtrack is GOD tier. I get chills every time I listen to any of the songs either from this or the prequel.

Life is Strange,319630,0.0,17,solo,"Action, Adventure",76561198969781032,"Before you read this review - if you're considering buying this game because you're looking for a good ""choices matter"" game with incredible time travel mechanics and attention to detail, and you haven't played Steins;Gate, definitely buy Steins;Gate instead, no questions asked. If you've already played Steins;Gate and you are looking for something that has some of the same types of themes, I guess this game kind of does... But be prepared to lower your expectations. A lot.

This game had a lot of potential and I was pretty intrigued after playing through the first episode... But then once I started playing the DLC episodes I realised pretty quickly that even though it constantly tells you ""your choices will influence the past, present, and future, choose wisely"", none of your choices actually have any real impact on the story. Whenever you encounter a choice that seems like it should have a significant impact, you can pretty much bet that whatever character is affected by the choice has already completed their role in the story by that point and won't really be mentioned much for the rest of the story (regardless of which option you picked).

One thing I did like about the game is the rewind mechanic. It is implemented really well, and there are quite a few good puzzles that make use of it. Unfortunately, this leads me into my next complaint, which is the abundance of bugs in the game that range from slightly inconvenient to pretty infuriating.

One of the most annoying bugs in this game is that the camera constantly locks up. I think it has something to do with ""examining"" something and then immediately trying to move the camera after closing the examine screen. It will lock your camera in a specific direction and make it impossible to look around for a while, and then after you walk around for long enough the camera will eventually fix itself (usually). And then there are a couple of sections where you can get locked in the rewind screen without any way of escape and you have to restart the section and go through everything again. Also something is glitched with the textures, it seems like the characters sometimes have multiple layers and one of the layers sometimes halfway glitches and they get super pale or something. Fortunately that one is pretty easy to ignore because the graphics are already bad enough that you don't really notice. Not that bad graphics really detracts from the overall experience, which is obviously a lot more narrative-driven than something that's meant to blow you away with visual fidelity.

Then there's the plot. The time travel stuff is pretty interesting and there are some genuinely clever ethical dilemmas that arise from it, but the setting really wasn't for me. Most of the characters are annoying (which makes sense I guess because they're all teenagers at a private school) and there's a lot of swearing for no good reason. And the main conflict is just weird, and doesn't seem realistic at all. Also, I grew up in Oregon and THERE AREN'T ANY FIREFLIES. I guess that's a nitpick, but that immediately broke what little immersion there was for me, lol

Anyway, I wouldn't recommend paying $20 for the DLC even if you played the first episode and enjoyed it. Your money is much better spent on something like Steins;Gate.",False,1,1,1762556626

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The game world can be quite spectacular to behold. Inquisition takes the foundation of DA1 and DA2 and expands it immensely. The locations you visit are varied, from ancient Elven forests to sandy deserts to stormy coasts, the locations are different enough to where the biomes don’t get repetitive and even have some throwbacks to DA1. Furthermore, the exploration and interaction are good. Each area has tons of collectables and lore entries that teach the player about the area and where it fits into the history of Thedas. 
Perhaps the big negative thing to point out here is quantity over quality. I would have preferred if there were actually [i]less[/i] zones with a greater emphasis on each zone being deeper and more meaningfully designed. Because while they are beautiful to behold and can be fun to explore, fatigue is very real and remembering the nuances of each area can be more difficult than it should be. 

The narrative is okay. It’s a typical “Big bad trying to destroy the world” type thing, but I think the setting and characters elevate the narrative to greater heights. 
As for the DLCs, Jaws of Hakkon is forgettable, The Decent is better, and Trespasser is probably the best bit of story content in the game, shame the best parts only last ~20 minutes. 

[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The mechanics are decent, but I feel that largely it is a step back in depth from DA1 and more inline with the gradual streamlining of DA2. The prior games had a unique take on Dungeons & Dragons, while DA:I feels much more shallow. It’s kind of like going from something like Final Fantasy X to FF XV - yes, it's prettier and faster and cooler, but the RPG mechanics suffer. Gone are any sort of stat-based conversation options, the character progression is simplified, and even abilities can feel very boring and shallow. The game does open up a bit when you unlock your classes' specialization, as some of those kits are fun and work very well with the base classes, but I still can’t help but feel an overall theme of having less RPG mechanics in an RPG game, which is a big negative for me. 
New to DA entirely (I think) is the crafting. This can help to customize your character's gear, especially if you don’t know where the best drops are or if you are simply unlucky. 

The difficulty is generally fairly easy, especially as you level up and unlock better gear and more talents. I played on Normal, and it was a tad difficult in the beginning, but by the time I unlocked my Knight Enchanter specialization after about ~12 hours, I was blowing things up.
One thing I did enjoy is the addition of “Trials” which are optional difficulty increases. You can choose to add elective difficulty increases for some small increased awards like additional loot. Things like having enemies level with you (which is how it naturally was in DA1/DA2) or even an option to turn bears into mini-boss gods. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
The graphics are very PS4-era, and while they do age pretty well for a ~11 year old game, certain things like animations can be very stiff and reflections on metal surfaces appear just awful. Still, I think this is a great looking game for its age. 
Probably the worst area graphically is the menu UI. It definitely feels like the focus is on the console versions because the UI is just awful to use with a mouse and keyboard. You have to constantly do things like move your mouse off and then back onto an item to get the tooltip to display. 

On the technical side, the game is not good. I experienced multiple crash to desktops and many bugs when my game simply wouldn’t load, and I had to alt+F4 to the last save. Even aside from technical issues, I ran into gameplay bugs where my characters would stop using abilities, or I couldn’t pick up items on the ground. I had to reload often to fix them. I even ran into bugs where essential characters seemed to have fallen through the ground and was missing all their dialog, essentially ruining the quest.

[h1] [b] Audio – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
I found the audio to be good. The music is largely forgettable, but there were a few iconic songs that are great. 
Voice acting is top-notch and awesome. 
I did encounter many cases where the audio simply stopped working. From combat to dialog, no sound. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]
I think there is some decent replay value here - you can choose male or female, different races, different classes, and different romances as well as a few quests that have some slightly different outcomes. The game is pretty linear, but the choices can definitely warrant multiple runs. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Dragon Age Inquisition (DAI) is the THIRD game in the Dragon Age series. I highly recommend you go and play the first and second, as they have aged fairly well and are great experiences. Now that you’re here and thinking of diving into DAI what can you expect and how does it compare to DA1/DA2? 

DA1 has a very dark setting full of intrigue. It’s full of solid RPG gameplay that is parallel to Dungeons & Dragons. DAI does not largely have that. DA2 seemed like a step-down from many of the things that made DA1 so great, but it’s still a good RPG. I feel like DAI is on par with DA2 in that it's decent, but streamlined so much that player choice suffers. 

What DAI offers is a massive open world within the Dragon Age universe, like you’ve never seen it before. I want to make it clear that massive does not mean good. DAI has a clear problem of quantity over quality. You can easily burn dozens of hours doing fetch quests and other random pointless crap that serves no narrative purpose other than to increase your “Points” that you can then spend on unlocking more zones to do more pointless things that give more points…DAI is a nice 40-hour RPG adventure wrapped up in an 80-hour game. 

It’s not all bad, though. I would say the best part is the story. That 40 hour story is pretty good for about 20 of those hours. Especially the DLC, Trespasser. If Mass Effect’s sendoff was anything to go by, BioWare is very good at doing epilogues for their games and where it ends immediately makes you want more. Also, I have to do a shoutout to the great characters. It’s a pretty great cast of characters with their own personalities. Sera is my elfy wife. 

Overall, yes, I would recommend DAI. I think it's an okay game. Fans of DA1 and DA2 probably shouldn’t miss it. 

[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]
[h1]Yes[/h1]
$40 is steep for an 11 year old game. $10 sale price though is very good for the amount of content you get, and if you can get it for the historical low of $4, VERY worth.

[i](This review contains no story spoilers btw!!)[/i]

[b]-Overview-[/b]
Developed by BioWare, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a massive fantasy RPG that blends real-time combat with tactical strategy. Players take command of the Inquisition, leading a diverse group of companions to restore order to a fractured world. With hundreds of quests, beautiful environments, and meaningful choices, it delivers an epic adventure, but it is also heavily built on the foundations of the previous two Dragon Age games, and newcomers may feel they’ve missed major pieces of context.

[b]-Story & Characters-[/b]
[i]A strong, engaging story, best experienced after playing the first two games.[/i]
 Inquisition’s narrative is well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and packed with political drama, divine conflict, and moral decisions. However, the game relies heavily on world events, character arcs, and choices established in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II. Returning characters make cameos, past decisions impact present events, and major story threads continue directly from earlier titles.

For players who haven’t experienced the prior games, much of this depth risks feeling distant or incomplete. The Dragon Keep system, which lets you import or manually reconstruct past choices, helps fill the gaps mechanically,  but not emotionally. Reading about choices you never made or characters you never met is a poor substitute for having lived those stories yourself. This is one of the few RPGs where your personal history with the series genuinely matters, and missing that history can lessen the impact of major scenes.

As a first-time Dragon Age player, it’s easy to feel like you’re walking into the third act of a trilogy without having seen the first two. The story is still very good, but you’ll constantly sense that you’ve missed meaningful context, relationships, and payoffs. If anything: I wish someone had told me to play the first two games first. I would have enjoyed this story far more if I’d brought my own choices and experiences into it instead of relying on presets.

Companions are well-written and offer solid banter and personal quests. Their level of involvement is similar to Fallout 4: they’re memorable and distinct, but their presence has less influence on the core story than companions in Mass Effect or Dragon Age: Veilguard.

[b]-Gameplay-[/b]
[i]A complex combat system that becomes satisfying once mastered.[/i]
 Combat can be overwhelming early on, especially for players new to managing AI tactics and switching between party members. Over time, though, it becomes one of the game’s strengths. The mix of real-time action and tactical pausing allows for careful planning or fast-paced brawling, depending on your build. However, people who aren’t new to this type of combat system will find themselves bored with the lack of builds you can make with your character. Still, I found it to be quite enjoyable, regardless.

Character progression is exceptionally well-paced: you begin fragile and unsure, but grow steadily stronger through skill trees, specialization classes, and improved gear. You cannot brute-force enemies above your level, they will flatten you, but the game fairly challenges you within your tier.

Exploration is vast, and each region feels alive with wildlife, secrets, side quests, and collectibles. The sheer amount of optional content is impressive, though some zones can feel bloated with minor objectives.

[b]-World Design & Visuals-[/b]
[i]One of the most visually striking RPGs of its era.[/i]
 The landscapes are vibrant, diverse, and grounded in strong artistic direction. From snowy fortresses to lush jungles and windswept deserts, each region is detailed and atmospheric. The world feels alive and lived-in, and the lighting and environment design remain a standout even today.

[b]-Music & Sound-[/b]
[i]A solid soundtrack that shines in key moments.[/i]
 While the score is not consistently memorable on its own, it elevates major scenes beautifully. Music swells during emotional peaks and blends seamlessly into exploration. Voice acting is strong across the board.

[b]-Length & Value-[/b]
[i]A colossal RPG with well over 90 hours of content.[/i]
 Even a focused run takes dozens of hours, and completionists can expect significantly more,  especially with story DLC. At its frequent sale price, it’s excellent value. However, this isn’t necessarily a good thing, as by the end of the game, you start to get bored exploring all these different zones and doing all these different fetch quests, and at some point, you just wish for the game to end.

[b]-Replayability-[/b]
[i]Worth replaying only if you want to see major branching outcomes.[/i]
 The game offers multiple endings and many impactful choices, but each playthrough is a major time investment. Most players will likely complete it once and revisit it after a long break.

[b]-Summary-[/b]
Dragon Age: Inquisition is a richly developed RPG with excellent world-building, strong narrative arcs, and satisfying character progression. Its size can be overwhelming, but its story and environments are worth the time, provided you play the first two Dragon Age games first.

For newcomers, the Dragon Keep system cannot replicate the emotional weight of decisions you never made or relationships you never formed. The game is filled with callbacks, cameos, and payoffs designed for long-time fans, and much of that will be lost without experiencing the earlier titles.

[b]Highly recommended, especially after completing Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, which will greatly enhance the story and make Inquisition feel like the true saga finale it was designed to be. 9/10 game, not surprised it’s won game of the year before.[/b]",True,0,0,1763751839

Despite how good Dragon Age Origins was, no amount of nice lore and storyline helps me tolerate the obsessive amount of grinding in this game that does not know if it wants to provide a good single-player experience or to be an MMORPG with offline servers.

Dragon Age Inquisition is the product of a new design philosophy that spits on the memory of Dragon Age Origins by diverting the player from its previous narrative-driven and consequence-driven logic to an open-world design with vestigial elements from a logic of microtransactions in pay to win games.

Of course there are no microtransactions in Dragon Age Origins, but we all know that blocking quests behind real wait times (like in the war room) are only used by game developers to force players into paying to unlock these sections of the game faster. By blocking quests merely for the sake of it under hours or days, the developers brought a vestige from the microtransaction systems of P2W games, and this is not the only instance where Dragon Age Inquisition is more akin to an MMORPG than to a good single-player RPG.

But what is so wrong with this new design philosophy that Bioware has adapted? That it breaks the narrative of what Dragon Age is.
Dragon Age Inquisition is the story of a person who seems to have been touched by divine power, surviving an explosion with a mark that provides the key to bring the world back into order from beaches that allow demons to cross from the fade to Thedas. It is the story of a person who becomes the public face of an organization tasked with saving the world. It is a story of urgency, the breaches won't wait for the main character to have a field trip before they come to save the world.

Yet, the game design gets everything wrong:
1. Despite the narrative emphasis that Dragon Age has always exhibited, every actual plot moment seems to be blocked by hours of constant grinding and filler material.
2. Every combat has lost all its meaning and it's now nothing but filler. Every enemy is an HP piñata ready to waste your time even in the easiest difficulties. And not even in the sense of being difficult, just in the sense of being unnecessarily long.
3. The open-world zones destroy all sense of urgency and of pacing, letting the player roam to the most irrelevant places.
4. Most of the side quests are filler content that lack any connection to the player's status as the Herald of Andraste or even any relevance to their mission. Yeah, you can make people be more favorable to the Inquisition by helping them do menial things, but that is not the job for the person who is in charge of closing the breaches. The open-world design forces the player character into an errand-runner, but they are not an errand-runner. They are the Herald of Andraste!

Thus, all these are symptoms of a game design philosophy that does not suit the narrative of a Herald touched by almost divine power. The open world logic forces a dissonance where, despite the urgency of the situation and the role the main character plays in the great scheme of things, the player is invited to waste its time doing everything but the engaging with the main plot. Its vast open-world zones interrupts the pacing and drama, its excessive amount of filler combat distracts from the actual point of the story and its new system of side quests excessively reliant on letters (instead of actual interesting interactions with real people) does not add to the real plot. We've gone from a story-driven game to an open world with the vestiges of microtransaction logic bringing about a degree of dissonance that just destroys the entire experience. Going to a new place like Val Royeaux does not feel anymore like advancing the plot, but like just opening a new can of worms with more irrelevant chores to complete. This game may be great for grinders and completionists, but it does not feel at all like a continuation of Dragon Age Origins.

But this, is not that. This is just one tragedy right after another, almost all caused by a certain apparently incredibly racist demographic. That's the message, a certain demographic is evil and racist and this game attempts to show you first hand just how treacherous and cruel the world is for anyone outside of that demographic. So if you love  political messages being shoved down your throat, this is the game for you.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of the dialogue is unskippable, none of the characters are likable, all just victims of the racist and religious evil doers with their own uninteresting stories of how they're also victims. This results in being forced to sit through literally hours of boring dialogue from people you just do not care about in the slightest.

I'm gonna be honest, I've put this review off for quite some time but I feel like it's now or never because I want to put this game behind me and never engage with it again.

Just like with the other titles in the Life is Strange series, I bought this game on release. I've played it on both PlayStation and PC as well as watched content creators, YouTubers, streamers and friends play through the game. I'm sure I've squeezed every bit of content I can out of this game and explored most if not all options. My tldr; it's the worst thing that's happened to the Life is Strange franchise.

To those that know me, it's no secret that I genuinely despise this game. I hate the fact that they took such a beautiful story concept that was Life is Strange (2015) and decided to turn it into a political issue and add forced religion as the cherry on top. 

Don't get me wrong, I think these are very important issues that definitely needs to be addressed, I just hate that they used Life is Strange as the platform to do it. 

Going into this game completely blind, besides seeing teasers and trailers and what the developers had shown us online previously to playing it, I was genuinely interested. I thought it was going to be an emotional journey with intriguing characters to meet along the way just like previous games but was quickly severely disappointed. 

I think my absolute biggest grudge with this game has to be Daniel. I'm not joking when I say I would put him among some of the worst, most annoying characters I have ever seen in any video game. Worse than Ashley Graham - Resident Evil 4 (2005). Worse than Navi - Legend of Zelda. Worse than Paimon - Genshin Impact. 

Not even one hour into the game and I already wanted to leave this runt in the middle of the forest to starve by himself. The dialogue, his actions, his thinking-it was all like nails on chalkboard and I couldn't stand him. The constant lying, betrayal towards his own brother, the god complex he portrayed because of his powers and his need to put others down made me have to unwillingly battle through any content throughout this game that had Daniel involved.

""But he is a child, they make stupid decisions!"" I hear-yet whenever we see other children throughout the franchise they're not HALF as ignorant or dumb as Daniel is. 

""He lost his father, he is dealing with trauma!"" Loss is a massive part of this franchise and it doesn't justify ANY of his poor thinking or unjustified actions throughout the game.

I've seen the praise that brothers Diaz get from others that love this game and I'm happy they have characters they're so fond of, I've accepted the fact that I don't like Daniel and I never will.

The other characters you meet along the way are ""okay""? I guess.. Some of them stick out more than others and you have short moments where you get to explore them more and learn more about their story and their life and it's honestly the part of this game that I enjoyed the most. Sitting by a campfire together, drinking beer and sharing stories of past trauma or exciting events was moments where I felt the most engaged with this game. I think it's this games strongest asset but also where they missed a core opportunity for great writing. There are moments where you meet characters who are intriguing and who have genuine care for you and your brother and who offer well needed help in time of need. Only for the game to throw these characters away never to be seen again. Shout-out Brody. You won't be forgotten.

My second grudge with this game was the ENTIRE CHAPTER focused on a religious cult. 

It's like they asked each other in the office previous to making this game and brainstorming how they could make Daniel even MORE unbearable. By slapping a religious sticker on his forehead and FORCING the played to interact with it. The entire chapter as a whole felt like a chore, your saving grace is meeting your long lost mother Karen (Voiced by the amazing Jolene Andersen, aka. Ada Wong - Resident Evil) and trying to patch up their broken relationship. Yet nothing felt more justified than setting the cult's home ablaze and leaving this horrendous chapter to burn to ash (literally).

So was there any parts to the game that I actually enjoyed? Yes. Of course there was. I give credit where credit is due. Being on the run and seeking help from long lost family or strangers gave a feeling of unease and caution but also a sense of warmth and trust at the same time. Bonding with the introduced characters was great, along with music that's iconic for Life is Strange games, though I felt a slight step down from previous titles, still great tunes to get lost in.

Something I will give this game praise for is it felt like they finally landed that sweet spot where puzzles felt natural. Something I gave previous titles some bad score for because of it's misuse of puzzles, I was glad to see LiS 2 finally managed to get it right. 

In conclusion I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they are looking to complete every title in the series, I feel like this game can easily be avoided or watched online. I wouldn't suggest someone to buy this game even on sale, though definitely pick it up for free or play it if it was gifted to you. I'm sure there are many others who will love this game and give it praise that it's known for.

Minor bugs were present though nothing near other titles. I was happy to see that.

All in all it's another addition to the LiS franchise and another episodic, decision based story game to get lost in for anyone looking for games matching this criteria.",False,2,0,1761503418

An abundance of idiotic one-hit-kill mechanics coupled with limitations to saving that lead to having to do boring shit over and over again (a couple of the fights are really unreasonable to boot), the lack of any (!) character development, the worst/most uninteresting loot/equipment system I've ever seen (and with the spectre weapons you can get before the halfway point being the best in the game, all further weapon looting is pointless – and so are the millions of accumulating credits you can't spend on anything because there is nothing worth buying! this isn't even amateur level game design, it's retard level!), boring-as-fuck levelling which is completely unbalanced as well, psionic abilities all seem to do the same thing (namely, hindering your opponent for a few seconds – I can't tell a difference between them at all!), the abominable balance of main and side quests (speedrunners must love this though...), unskippable cutscenes, many, many bugs... and, most direly, the total and utter failure in the RPG aspect as you cannot choose even your own words (!), much less anything else between generally good and vaguely evil... and it's beyond reason itself, as predecessor Knights of the Old Republic was infinitely better in each and every single regard, and DA:O which came afterwards in almost all regards!

EDIT: Game 2. Oh boy! There is more character development in the first 30 min than in game 1, but the actual gameplay is so much worse I simply cannot believe it! Only 4 to 6 things to level instead of some 15 (!), you can't specialise in weapons, the actual shooting feels way worse, the first (!) group battle is already next to unwinnable (and I did beat game 1 on hardest difficulty...), health refills are gone apparently (or I cannot find them) and to top things off, I cannot figure out how to fucking map the quickslots (which I never used in the first game, as I was able to map the weapons to keys, WHICH SHOULD ALSO BE THE CASE HERE!). Fucking shit, the sniper scope doesn't even line up with your line of sight, LOLOOLOL.

I cannot believe how hard they fucked up the gameplay compared to the already not very good first game! No inventory at all, four or five skills to level, no specialisation in weapons, still no feedback whatsoever – you are literally not told whether you hit an enemy or not, and what hits you in turn (even though the latter isn't as important as you can't protect yourself against different kinds of damage, OBVIOUSLY)! No way to boost your abilities in something like the insane garage fight (complete with the biggest video game sin that exists, infinitely respawning enemies – and that's against very limited ammo!!! Hell, after this shit I'll never complain about a game having infinite ammo again!), hell, the fuckers even took out health potions altogether!!! There's apparently quickslots but no apparent way to map them, so I have to change my weapon FROM THE FUCKING MENU EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Oh and making the sprint key not only the same as Use but also Cover in this one means I will never buy another game from this developer again.

I regret spending 4,79 on this fucking shit of a game, I really do. They did not test this game before releasing it, and they did not test the re-release either... what kind of people would do that... only the worst scum imaginable. Humanity doesn't DESERVE to be saved!",False,0,2,1763510572

With that out of the way, honestly to me the Trilogy's narrative doesn't hold up at all. 

The first game is great and establishes the world and a solid vibe game. The only complaint I have is that the companions are a bit vapid, but the game still rocks. 

The second game sidelines the entire first game and elements established within. The first game established the Trilogy's main antagonist, how much of a threat they're going to be, and how the galaxy needs to start preparing now. What's the second game about? Oh human colonies are going missing and a human terrorist organization is using Shepard to investigate them. At least that would be the plot if the main meat of the game wasn't spent on making sure your companions' family troubles aren't resolved. The focus on the small bunch of characters takes away from the greater universe and the impending doom that will need to be resolved in the third game. 

Imma be honest, I've played Mass Effect 3 before and trying to play it after 1 and 2 is a huge tone shift that makes the game feel like it's not a Mass Effect game. Unfortunately 2 set up 3 in a bad spot and it shows from the start. ""Oh no, the doomsday threat we were warned about in the first game is here! You know, that giant ship that basically required a whole fleet to take one down is now here in mass! What will we do?!"" Then Liara shows up with the blue prints for the Deus Ex Machina device and a point system that will determine if Shepards lives or dies in the either the Mountain Dew ending, the Mountain Dew Code Red ending, or in the Mountain Dew Voltage ending. But along the way, you get to rush by and resolve everyone else's problems because they wouldn't let you do so in the 2nd game due to babysitting duty.

ME1 - Fun third person RPG Shooter with depth for the story and gameplay Completed on Insanity nearly 100%.

ME2 - Awkward arcade hide and peek shooter that continues the story from ME1. It is a significant downgrade gameplay wise. Working on first play through on Insanity, but it simply is a worse game than ME1.

Long story less long:

ME 1: This is one of the best shooter RPG games I have ever played. Even though the graphics may be dated, the story is worth playing with good gameplay to back it up. The attention to detail in the world interactions rivals and beats games released in 2025. 

From social interactions that have implications later in the story, to physical interactions with the world, ME1 feels like a full game worth playing.

I would recommend giving it a try if this is on your backlog.

ME2: It is alright - very similar to ME1, but there are differences. The gameplay is such a let down after ME1, it feels like some exec who didn't even play the first game made some changes on how the fundamentals work by stripping a lot of the core gameplay from the game:

1.  There is no inventory system & you cannot swap weapons/armor during a mission.
2. They managed to make the maps & navigation worse and less useful in ME2. Can't even access the ground map during a mission. ME1 you could access it and place a custom marker at any time.
3. Weapon selection is limited and upgrading weapons is completely different.
4. They took the ability to crouch out of the game. This SIGNIFICANTLY limits how you can play the game compared to ME1.

 In order to crouch, you have to be directly in front of cover and it is not a true crouch, more of a duck and cover.  

Example why this is bad: I am standing, but the wall in front of me across some cross fire, could protect me if I could just MANUALLY CROUCH to hide from the enemy. In order to crouch, I have to go through cross fire that is currently blocked by a wall that will not provide protection if I crouch against it...but it is protecting me against the crossfire.

UnFun fact: You cannot crouch against every wall, anyways.

5. Sprint, Take Cover, Action/use are all mapped to same button.
6. You auto heal outside of combat, you do not use medi-packs to heal anymore.
7. They changed how weapons work in the universe, slightly. No longer do you have enough energy to run your weapon over the time the story takes place, but you now have depletable ammo. Ammo replaces the cooldown mechanic. 

This puts organics another step back from [spoiler]the Reapers[/spoiler] technology wise.

It was fun sneaking around in ME1, slowly moving around corners and peeking for shots. I hope manual crouch is brought back in future games...

I can see why people do not like Mass Effect 2. It is a stripped down version of ME1, with better graphics. The ""it does not feel like as much of an RPG as ME1"" comments are warranted. It doesn't.

7. Also, they made bypassing circuitry just... a hidden puzzle matching game...

You need to download EA's app to play the game at all, and if you don't make an account and log in then it will pop up every time you boot your PC up pestering you about it (even when you haven't loaded up Steam yet, never mind tried to play the game). There's no workaround for this, far as I can tell... and I did look.

I've only touched ME1 and I've had problems with the game progression. There's barely any tutorial, I keep having to look up how to do basic things like holster weapons and heal. Load times are meh, graphics are worse than I expected for a modern remaster, but that's fine, I can forgive that.

But the BUGS. My god. I was prompted to write this review by the fact that I just barely got past the ""prologue"" section of the game and immediately hit a game-breaking bug (cannot access the galaxy map, and therefore can't... do much of anything, I'm stuck on the Citadel).

I'll try reloading an old save and give those cutscenes another run-through, but this really doesn't bode well for the game overall. And I'm not eager for the experience of playing a game constantly worried that I'll be softlocked behind some random bug which makes my save unplayable.

The game itself, in terms of story and gameplay and so on, seems like something I could've been very into if I'd played when I was 14 but I can't say it feels especially engaging to me now.

We would later discover that this game was also the death knell for Telltale. Its industry veterans were thrown into the licensed IP meat grinder and churned out, over the next handful of years, riffs on the same formula: walk, dialogue, cutscene, 'choice'.

I can’t avoid the fact I fundamentally don’t enjoy zombie settings. I thought Telltale’s Walking Dead would be the game to finally turn me around - after all, it’s rated so highly that it seemed superficial to me to write it off so easily. I love the episodic narrative-based format, and I especially love a tear-jerker. See my adoration of Life is Strange.

My problem with zombies is the fact they’re [b] such a boring [/b]enemy. By their very nature, they have near zero intellectual power, making them the most mentally unchallenging enemy to fight. The best villains build tension by outwitting the main character. But Zombies are entirely predictable. They have no personality or character traits, they can’t give any dialogue or communicate in interesting ways. They’re just spammed ad infinitum and thrown at survivors.

But zombies aren’t considered the real enemy of the zombie genre. Instead, it’s people’s inability to work together which ultimately leads to their deaths. But this means pedantic infighting, petty drama and miscommunication take centre stage, which is incredibly frustrating to endure. It’s like when you watch a horror film where each character leads themselves to their deaths due to their inability to communicate. 

The Walking Dead is centred around both of these cliches, and while I won’t argue it introduces a few other ideas too, it ultimately revolves around petty arguments between the majority of the characters. I know there’s some fondness for the art style too, but character’s faces are so comically exaggerated that it feels like a kid’s cartoon at times. The cell-shading doesn’t feel like a choice motivated by a strong artistic identity, but rather a practicality of a low budget. The game’s story themes are dark, dreary and depressing, so this Borderlands-esque look works at odds to this.

The puzzles feel less about figuring out the problem, but instead talking to characters and engaging with items in a prescribed order for it to eventually trigger your character carrying out the solution. I do appreciate some of the decision-making, and I genuinely like Lee and Clementine, it’s bogged down by the petty and childish supporting cast. Also, the game’s climax is ruined the moment you open the game because of the Steam community integration. This means under the “Play game” button you see scores of memes and artwork relating to the game’s final moments, ruining the emotional impact completely.

I won’t argue this review is unfair, since I don’t enjoy the fundamentals of the zombie genre, but I did think The Walking Dead might be so good as to make me overlook this. Sadly, this wasn’t the case.",False,2,0,1756577653

[i]SOMA[/i] is a first person horror game with clever philosophical depth and profoundness. This is achieved with a few trivial yet somehow awfully meaningful choices along a gripping journey through a bleak underwater research facility. Splendidly voice-acted protagonist Simon ([b]Jared Zeus[/b]) and his acquaintance Catherine ([b]Nell Mooney[/b]) provide their own opinions but leave room for the player to think.

SOMA's weakness is the lack of gameplay mechanics: it is a walking simulator with slight puzzle and stealth elements. Replayability is almost nonexistent due to that. But for one playthrough, the game does provide an immensely immersive 10-hour experience. The physical interactivity of objects -- pushing and pulling doors, grabbing and throwing stuff -- makes the game world feel tangible.

Certain sections with a monster can become frustrating if you get stuck on repeating them. Fortunately, in a post-release update, [b]Frictional Games[/b] added a Safe Mode option that stops the monsters from hindering your progress.

There's enough quiet time to ponder these themes in between the monster encounters, most of which I found genuinely scary. The challenge of the game is basically to keep your nerve and figure out the monster's behaviour - short puzzles under emotional pressure. I think you'll be missing out if you use safe mode. 

There are also several more relaxed puzzles without any monster stalking you, which I found interesting and well-judged in terms of difficulty. I felt like I really could be the protagonist, trying this and that until something works. I also really appreciated that the game felt like a real environment, with lots of spaces and objects that aren't relevant to the player. I find this adds a lot to immersion. Furthermore, there are no stupid easter eggs or steam achievements for exploring every inch of the map. You can actually behave like you would if you were really in this world, instead of running around like a maniac looking for dopamine.
 
The story is excellent and very original. Not only that, I'd call it anti-formulaic.

After pushing through several hours, I’ve had enough. SOMA pretends to be this deep, atmospheric horror masterpiece, but in reality, it’s a painfully slow walking simulator with frustrating underwater segments. I’ve played my fair share of complex, puzzle-heavy survival horror games, and this one isn’t challenging, it’s just poorly executed and painfully repetitive gameplay.

The first hour hooked me with its atmosphere and story potential, but once you’re thrown underwater, the experience falls apart. Low visibility, sluggish movement, and maze-like areas where you wander aimlessly for hours with no sense of direction; not fun, not scary, just exhausting.

It’s a shame, because there’s clearly a good story buried somewhere under all this frustration. But good narrative design doesn’t excuse bad gameplay. I’ve played walking sims before, this one just happens to be the most boring one pretending to be more than it is.

Waiting for an elevator to go down, waiting for a vehicle to reach the destination, waiting for the game to load, wait for the audio log you triggered to finish because the game doesn't let you walk around while listening to them like every other game did since system shock 1 in 1994, waiting for a globule of doom to decide to finally hobble away, waiting for your character to crawl along an endless passage, wait for the character to incredibly slowly climb up a ladder (game fails the ladder rule), waiting for the endless expanse of ocean to finally lead to the next story module. The game should be like 4 hours but it's 10.

A horror game shouldn't have me intentionally running at 200mph towards the enemies you are supposed to avoid because i am tired of spending 30 minutes creeping around to avoid them when i can simply be punched in the face by them and get knocked out at which they automatically leave to a different part of the map.

There are sections of the game where the game tells you to do something but that something gets you killed anyway ""follow the lights"" if you follow the lights the monsters still kill you anyway and you have no way of hiding from them properly in that section so you just repeatedly get attacked anyway, so pointless.

Also, the concept of not being able to fight an enemy is unrealistic. A human can stab literally anything with an improvised spear and with enough conviction they will kill it. Welcome to being human we've been doing this since we lived in caves. (Yeah I don't care if the MC is technically only partially human in this game you know what I mean)

In short this is a walking simulator with like 5 puzzles in 10 hours. The story is good but the game is not. Also, the ending of the story sort of lives and dies on the idea of a programmer not understanding cut vs copy which I think would be the simplest of concepts for someone designing robots that contain human consciousness to understand.

DEVOUR plunges players into a frantic co-op horror experience where teamwork, panic, and quick thinking are the only things standing between your group and a terrifying cult entity. Each map feels like a self-contained nightmare, requiring coordination and courage as the tension escalates with every ritual item you collect.

The game shines in its simple yet effective co-op design. Working together to find items, manage resources, and dodge the ever-growing aggression of the possessed leader turns every match into a chaotic thrill ride. Communication is key—splitting up can mean faster progress, but also guarantees hilariously horrifying moments as someone gets dragged into the dark.

Atmosphere and pacing are major strengths. Each location—from haunted farmhouses to burning asylums—offers distinct threats, secrets, and environmental storytelling. The sound design ramps up fear at all the right moments, building suspense as the demon’s behavior evolves and the stakes rise.

Progression and replayability keep players coming back. Difficulty settings, unlockable cosmetics, and new maps with unique mechanics ensure that each run stays fresh. The unpredictability of enemy behavior and the frantic scramble near the end of each round make DEVOUR consistently exciting with friends.

Final Verdict:
DEVOUR is a fast, frightening, and wildly entertaining co-op horror experience. Its escalating tension, distinct maps, and teamwork-focused gameplay make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer scares and chaos-filled sessions with friends.

**DEVOUR – Review**

Pretty good horror game honestly. It looks simple at first but once the demon girl starts running at you full speed, bro your heart just drops. Playing with friends is hilarious and scary at the same time. It does get a bit repetitive sometimes, but it still keeps you on edge.

For the price, totally worth it. I screamed way more than I wanna admit. 8/10

A Short Hike,1044720,27.99,0,solo,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",76561198052380519,"This is one of those games where the first 20 hours or so are very addicting as you learn to swim in an ocean of content and struggle with balancing your economy with logistics and raids; but once you understand how to swim in the ocean, the mechanics all feel really flat and repetitive. Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.

The good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.

Visually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.

My gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.

The combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.

As many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.

Overall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",False,2,0,1764008930

Starting a next run you're gonna be doing the same limited set of actions you can do to build your city. I have exhausted all variation quite shortly. I feel claustrophobic and lonely, it feels like im playing an empty husk of a world. Let me explain several independent thoughts I have which I'm conflicted about. These are only a few examples to explain a small portion of my feels.

Several mechanics and rules just live in the wild online as myths and mysticisms: what for, and how to use the wagon shop for example. Of course that's not the only one, as there are several other ones that are just not declared by the game so you kinda have to guess and hope it works like you want. Reading reddit comments and forum posts of other people's thoughts on what they believe the mechanic works like. There are several annoyances in the game that keep piling up at the back of your mind as you build your city and you get to know the systems of the game. Some examples:

The upgrade and proximity system encourages you to just cramp things together and make grids. It often comes down to ""do you want a pretty town, or do you want to survive?""
We want a pretty town of course, thats the game's appeal. But in the back of your mind this annoyance is always going to be there.

It's great that you can set a max limit for resources, so that villagers can quit that job and enter an other one. But this isn't true for all jobs: farmers, healers, soldiers are assigned to their duties and are still busy standing in their job title. There is no downside to unassigning them while they are not useful. You can also just let them be, which is what I do: but it's still going to be an annoyance in the back of your mind.

The reason for my dislike isn't concretely these 2-3 examples. It's the overall feel, for which I have provided these examples. This feel, while the game is in early access is fine, but not as a full release at full price: Which is how I encountered this game the first time. I gave it enough playtime for me to doubt myself, because I did have doubts, maybe I just didn't understand the vision or the game.

My ultimate verdict, as of 1.00, is go play songs of syx if you want a challenging city builder.  If you want a cozy city builder, this game is for you on the lowest difficulty.

I say this as someone who plays on vanquisher.

The game is fundamentally flawed on what makes a city builder engaging for those looking for difficulty/challenge 


Logistically this game is extremely lacking in complexity, even though on the surface it may not appear so.  Villagers are completely incapable of handling distances, despite the existence of wagons.  

There is no simple button of ""only allowed wagons to transport"" a resource.  Villagers will walk half way across the map to a node, to grab 2 ore, instead of waiting for a wagon to deliver.

You can get gamey with it to try and force it, but to me a city builder has failed on a basic level when you are unable to set such simple limits.

Second, the tech tree suffers from the same problem.  It may appear to offer depth complexity, but that is far from the truth.  Technology mostly exists to speed bump your city and its expansion by locking previous buildings behind tech.

There are glimmers of interesting ideas in the tree, active policies that trade benefirs for penalties; but they are mostly ineffectual or extremely strong to the point where the downside might as well not exist.

I could say more, especially the shallow nature of the military, but overall this game leaves me disappointed.",False,4,0,1763397736

The game isnt bad. It just lacks this organic feel to the creation of a village/city.
You could expect that you would be able to build something like in the artwork, but no.
You will end up creating mostly very straight roads, with roads following a rigid geometry. I would have love something more organic, more natural ( Manor Lords does this better).
The management is okay, i only found the combat really clumsy where you go back to the first age of empires, select everything and attack...
Not a bad game, not a great game just okay... is it enough for you? You decide !",False,1,0,1763316738
